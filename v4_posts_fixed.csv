Yeah it happens  I'm free to talk here or PM   Gotta keep your head up  don't think about it find something to keep you busy,F30
I don't blame women at all  Honestly if anyone ever did date me for some crazy reason  i'd just feel really sorry for them ,F30
I jusst did it ,F30
While you're at it  fuck 2018 and 2019  heck  fuck all the way to 2099  No need for more years  Fuck 'm all ,F30
TV series  Find something out there you like  with at least three seasons  and you're gonna love it ,F30
Good for you mate  Have fun  ,F30
"I get that this is a depression subreddit but maybe we shouldn't encourage others to ""resign"" from life",F30
it is a special kind of headache ,F30
Stimulant overdoses are usually painful as fuck    I'd recommend you get to an ER or call an emergency service asap it's really not a fun way to go   ,F30
If it's any consolation to you I went to bed early on NYE  In fact the holidays seem to have passed me by with the only noteworthy event being my virulent head cold ,F30
I do desperately try to speak to her and get ahold of her but otherwise I'm not like your ex  I love her  I really do  It just breaks my heart to be without her  I can't move on and I won't move on  ,F30
I'm absolutely lovesick and heartbroken  ,F30
Yeah  I went cold turkey off of Wellbutrin last year  It ruined my brain  as I now have seizures  I wouldn't recommend it  Just slowly wean off to be safe ,F30
I am pretty much the same  but two years older  and I didn't gratuate high school  Well  I just seem to keep going  Maybe it will get better ,F30
Wow totally describes my relationship with depression and emotions  or lack thereof  ,F30
Doing that right now  Once you are drunk it isnt that difficult  but alcohol always goes both ways,F30
Alcohol  video games and cycling  That's the stuff ,F30
Even the drink can't help getting through this night my God my head feel like it's got a ton of weight on it ,F30
I think I'd do well I don't really need those 2 things anyways,F30
I am  therefore i must post ,F30
Hey  I love you too  man  I hate that you're going through that right now  ,F30
Does not have the same ring to it though  Hip new year perhaps ,F30
Why 12 34  ,F30
It's ridiculous I have to drug myself to not want to blow my brains out   To dupe my brain into thinking it's happy   I still hated life even when I had 10k in the bank   Ridiculous ,F30
I don't even know why  but this really made me smile  At the end of the day  we are all different and different things make us happy  Being happy is really the only thing that matters  i think   ,F30
Yeah  that's nowhere near enough ,F30
Well at this point I consider I have turned insane ,F30
Better than my 2014 15  but pretty mediocre by any measure  Yours ,F30
Sounds like you've tried it all   Sorry you haven't had better results   I don't know what to do next ,F30
If it doesn't change and it bothers you report him,F30
Thank you  Happy new year ,F30
For real pm me if you ever want to talk about it  I could enjoy having a single girl friend to vent with ,F30
To start  you might want to read this http   www cracked com blog 5 facts everyone gets wrong about depression ,F30
Yep  exactly the same for me ,F30
This is me  What makes it worse is that it's been exactly two years since we've been together and I'm still feeling this way  That's the most embarrassing part  Its been two years  ,F30
Go travelling  have some intimacy with a girl  be happy ,F30
Now hold on a minute  You can't do that without finishing your job here  as you signed the contract when you were born  What do you mean you were'nt conscious being  Well who cares  Your mom and dad put the sign there for you ,F30
Same  I thought I made a new friend but he didn't even invite me to his own NYE party ,F30
You've only just begun my young friend  It will get better  You are loved  ,F30
Caffeine is really fkn disgusting  Tried the Same in June and i puked for like 3 days,F30
I know it's hard and scary  but the best thing would be to talk to someone in your life  Parent  teacher  someone  They can do more then any of us can,F30
Would you be able to talk about it more     were here  What about working pushes you so much ,F30
I can never seem to be able man up and do that  I have to explain to my parents about my phone and I still haven't done that  I don't think talking to them about this will come any easier ,F30
Thanks for the exposition shithead ,F30
What did you cry about  If you'd like to talk   ,F30
good luck on that sleepover  i hope you make friends  Im rooting for ya ,F30
Here's to 2017 being better than this shitshow of 2016 ,F30
2015 and 2016 were fkn hell,F30
Oh geez    Thanks for the warning  Sorry you had to find out the hard way ,F30
Feel free to pm me  I'll befriend anyone in this position,F30
"""But you are such a good BOY""      I am 26  I lose hair already  OK ",F30
happy new year     3 ,F30
happy new year to you  just here to say someone saw this and cared  on the same track as you man  keep going   ,F30
I felt like there was more purpose to being alone tonight than anything else,F30
Mind you this was on my own  not under doctor supervision ,F30
It isn't easy  But there is no formal way it needs to be done  Try writing it down    just take time    and then show them  You can do it    and it will help,F30
Should I reach out to her since it's a new year or would it be too expected or corny ,F30
I feel like I have lost too much  It is just painful  But thank you for caring   ,F30
Maybe you should be thankful your garbage genes were aborted     you've imposed a shit life   shitty world onto a child  good job ,F30
Noice  I'm attempting dark jokes to cope with depression now and it's a little hard but I think I might like it ,F30
Yep  people who've never been in long term relationships have NO idea how alone you can feel  even while you're in a relationship   Hope it gets better ,F30
i'm in basically the same situation  wishing you all the best ,F30
"The worst thing I hate hearing is ""stop being a negative thinker""",F30
for the love of god dont do this,F30
Omg  fuck that ,F30
Feeling you guys tonight ,F30
Can you tell me one     ,F30
The demons are you  they can't leave  You either tame them or live in terror      Tfw i wrote it and realized how accurate this actually is ,F30
Same  Feels fucking fantastic ,F30
I'm trying    ,F30
Video games and watching series mainly  It sucks when I run out of that   best distraction is going home to my mother but I only can do this on holidays  ,F30
Take it to PM  I'm trying not to be suicidal here and even with the subreddit gone I still get to read petty squabbles   ,F30
"Those threads are making me sad because people are putting wrong meaning to the word ""love""  Maybe its just me  but pretty much any similar word with less power would be more fitting      Edit  fix ",F30
"Not like stand up but I found it funny when people were talking about how so many celebrities were dying in 2016  Then a comment underneath was like ""lucky bastards"" and that made me laugh XD",F30
I'm so sorry  Here if you want to talk ,F30
"To break 50   ATM my ""normal"" days are heavily under 50  of the year  i want to at least come closer to it ",F30
Hi how are you doing,F30
Should you be upset  What makes you upset  For me parties were always like  this  https   pp vk me c543100 v543100141 17b9f z1Lmv0G9gcE jpg ,F30
I like your point of view   Good way of looking at it all    I hope I can get to a place of being ok on my own with or without love again   thanks,F30
this is really cool  Nice job  D,F30
I can relate to you so much  I just feel like every year is getting worse and worse  I'm pretty much the same age as you too  ,F30
Linkin Park   The Messenger,F30
Exactly  Im wishing college will go well for me so at least i can feel a bit better and concentrate on fixing myself  but it all seems hopless to me right now ,F30
I wish you a happy   better than 2016   year ,F30
i got your back bro  keep your head up  it would be nice to have people to go out and do something with but im here sitting on the computer  no one calls or texts but i barely know anyone  ya this feeling sucks ,F30
Back at you friend  here's to another year,F30
I agree with everything you said  Except I dont think there is a meaning to life  Where just here to exist and tbh I really dont want to  Appreciate ur comment tho,F30
Metallica metal  'Fade To Black'  Another one of their songs 'One' has a similar vibe but may in fact be even darker,F30
We survived 2016  no problem surving 2017 ,F30
I really hope so too  Hopefully being away from my family  who trigger my depression  will make things better  I feel like I probably won't even get into a good university though  I have zero motivation to do any work  ,F30
I still haven't watched to the point where Shepherd dies  I think I've gotten as far as he witnessed a car accident,F30
Advertising yourself as a helper and especially inviting PMs as a first resort are both against the posted rules here   ,F30
What's on your mind buddy ,F30
I know i would enjoy it and join them if i was truly myself  but i cant help being miserable,F30
I'm in a club right now  just as lonely  ,F30
Agree  please report stuff like this as it violates the posted rules and we will remove it as soon as we find it  ,F30
Thanks for the tedious lecture  genius ,F30
May i ask if they were online tests  Because im pretty sure that most 13 year olds feel like they have SEVERE ANXIETY DEPRESSION PTSD BIOPOLAR because they went online and took a quiz telling them that because they feel sad they have depression,F30
This year I will be happy  that I can guarantee  ,F30
Sorry it didn't help ,F30
Be careful    the rash is a life threatening reaction from this medication  Go to the ER to be sure ,F30
Thanks  I really hope I can get into somewhere at least semi decent  Do you not get a student loan in America  ,F30
Hope 2017 turns out to be brighter for you,F30
Anytime    What have you lost  If it's ok me asking   ,F30
Thus this post is pointless ,F30
You too  happy new year   ,F30
It works for me  explains a lot actually  ,F30
Feeling very similar  You're not alone in this    I could leave it and do anything else  But I'm having so low energy and no idea what to do else ,F30
Dont worry about Facebook  Not worth using  And there is nothing wrong with spending some time alone  I hope you have a better 2017  Stay positive,F30
Will do from now on  thanks,F30
You dont need God to be happy xD people still belive in santa etc     Plus im proud of u bro grill     I'm glad u found something that makes u want to be happy ,F30
It is kind of sad  So far High school sophomore year was the best time of my life  and now things kinda suck lol,F30
I always told myself I'd never do anything rash or stupid while in an emotional state  emotion clouds your judgement  I can look back on times I've 1000  wanted to die but now I'm kind of glad I didn't,F30
A lot of Hollywood Undead songs  Bullet  Pain  Hear Me Now  Black Dahlia to name a few    Edit  genre is rock  Sort of ,F30
Good for you     not sarcasm ,F30
Fuck  I am so miserable right now  I feel like I'm cursed to be alone  Does it get better  I got some good things coming up in the next few weeks but I'm worried it won't be enough  I'm tired of being me ,F30
What a handsome little guy  Happy new year to him aswell,F30
I listen to 9   5  by Dolly parton  It always cheers me up for some reason  Cheesy harmless song,F30
Yes  Very much so  ,F30
Everything can happen  either good or bad  2017 has only started  calm down and think positively ,F30
It seels like you can't be honest even with a stranger over internet  Its fine tho  If you find strenght  you can always write a wall of text in my inbox  I WILL read it and answer  What stops you from being yourself  ,F30
I'm 14 and I'm already stupid reckless drinking to numb pain and overall Suicidal as fuck,F30
   at least I'm not the only one   How do you keep going ,F30
I kinda have to be  or at least believe it  I need some motivation ,F30
There can be right and wrong without the existence of God  ,F30
That guy is cool  xD Do everything u can to make him happy  He'll appreciate it,F30
Social phobia  i'd like to join them but i think so little of myself in a social setting that i dont even try to engage with them  ,F30
"Lots of dealerships have somewhere between a 24 hour and 7 day ""changed you mind"" policy  If you honestly can't afford it and didn't pay the debt off I'd plead with them to take it back  ",F30
Yes  that is what I tell myself  I should rephrase it  I can't be sure of right or wrong without an absolute answer  God being an example ,F30
Not that complicated of a problem  but still ruining my life haha,F30
Worth going to urgent care  Being dead would suck  ,F30
Also depression for a year and counting,F30
One day at a time friend  one day at a time  I play games and watch series movies  You just gotta find things that pass time fast  kind of  Even if you're not going to enjoy them particularly much  ,F30
Doesn't matter about genre  But NF Is straight to the point he's a rapper and Saywecanfly is good too  But  he's a soft singer,F30
Hey bud  life throws stones at you  your job is to fight back and never give up  also  just remember that you have survived every single bad day so far ,F30
If you're new on reddit  check out  r getmotivated and  r books  ,F30
Then what's the point of r depression if we cannot look out for each other  ,F30
I'm defeated only 6 hours until new year's and 2017 will still  Ake me Depressed ,F30
Yep  I agree with you  Everything about my life gets worse by the minute  The world seems to do the same  ,F30
Happy new year to you and your sweet little friend there  I know what it means to have a special relationship with your dog     May the new year bring you both great things    Edited for spelling typo  ,F30
2017 launching a preemptive strike at my will to live,F30
True  it's celebrated all around the world and everyone is with loved ones or friends  the whole thing is way more present tgan vd,F30
Ditto  Broken record for the past 15 years now ,F30
Okay  I'm glad you have found this prospect of happiness  You CAN be happy  and you deserve it  Keep thinking along these lines  Happy new year ,F30
Makes me worse  somehow  YMMV  ,F30
Sounds awesome  I've been wanting to drive my own car for severeal months now but I still can't afford one  Damn ,F30
Doesn't matter if it's a new year    By the time it's 12 01 you're will to live will still be shattered with Depression,F30
This is my 6th consecutive year being home alone  It's not that I don't have options  my anxiety won't let me out   Plus I just don't see the point in many things anymore ,F30
It's all I can think of ,F30
It not the nicest mix is it  hope you can continue to get through it,F30
My depression has responded best to the following  out of the tens of meds  combos I've tried  Ritalin  Abilify  Kratom  Oxycodone  Provigil  I have 'atypical' depression FWIW  Naturally  don't start the Oxy unless you have to  ,F30
Another year to endure  Many of us won't make it  ,F30
Yep  It does zip for me now  even after weeks of abstinence  Bummer  ,F30
It's okay  thanks for the honesty     ,F30
2 comments are shadow banned   Edit  3 comments shadow banned for some reason  Maybe I'm shadow banned and that's why I can't see these comments  Hmmm   ,F30
Forgive me but how can the election bother you this much  I doubt your life on a day to day basis will change much at all  ,F30
Number 3 is so fucking true  I know I would have these problems whether I was with someone or not  but what's wrong with having someone who truly loves you  in spite  of your problems  It's better than not having that ,F30
I just now discovered tonight was New Year's Eve after googling hours for a restaurant  I normally don't do anything for New Years but was thinking about going out tomorrow  Oh well  maybe next year haha  ,F30
Happy new year  fellow human,F30
As 17 year old  I've been through some bad spots  Talk to someone  It's the most important step  It's bad now  If you can survive this you can survive the next thing ,F30
Same thing happened to me tonight  All of my friends are with their SO's  I'm eating a gun tomorrow  Hopefully then they'll all get the hint that I was suffering ,F30
I'm with OP  Gunna start this year off right with a quality suicide attempt  Hopefully it works  ,F30
"I want to blow my brains out at a house party in front of all my ""friends""  ",F30

Thank you for your feedback  I'm taking this day by day  hopefully a visit to the psychiatrist will help or at least give me some answers ,F30
Goddamn this speaks to me really hard   ,F30
The first time I took Provigil I started putting in 15 hour work days out of the blue     YMMV of course  but just saying  Now it has no discernable effect  ,F30
That sucks   But why did she send you pictures  Keep your heads up though  today a new  365 pages long story starts and you're just about to write the beginning    ,F30
Hope so too   Just remember that it can take time to get meds straightened out so as cliche as it may sound  patience is key ,F30
Your posts have been absolutely beautiful  thank you ,F30
Whilst I don't know if you're serious or not I wish you all the best  no matter which way you choose   ,F30
Cheers to yet another year   ,F30

I use to watch videos all the time  but then again I'm realizing it's just pointless and a waste of time   Unfortunately there's nothing else for me to do   So yeah,F30
Hm I guess I can be lucky not to have a sister  especially a sister asking such hurtful questions  u,F30
Seriously  its like our brains embraces them  it doesnt make any sense  Most mental illnesses fuck with your life in many ways  why dont we have some kind of defense mechanism against this ,F30
Yes I'm bored I have a headache,F30
Thank you  I appreciate the kind words,F30
Snapchat is worse  Yet I still click through each and every story of people having a good time  ,F30

I'm doing alright  What about you ,F30
What a positive post under all the negative ones   Happy new year everyone ,F30
For me music is one of those things that can make me feel a little  usually because the song in some small sense can describe how i feel  most of the time i feel pretty numb  ,F30

I kinda don't get it either  ,F30
OP is on Long island     Thanks for the offer ,F30

I haven't heard of TMS  but I will look into it now  But yeah those side effects sound pretty drastic  and with a lack of permanence  sounds pretty terrible  ,F30
I noticed but just did what I do every day  ignoring the fireworks outside  ,F30
you're the first person in this thread to comment on my writing  thank you,F30
Caffeine is definitely one of my go tos  But I also take Effexor  damn though they are throwing everything at you  has it been helping    ,F30

Omg me too  I want to hang myself or cut myself at a party,F30
I'm not so far down yet  but even if nothing works out  I'll embrace the crap life throws at me  for I will at least die knowing I've tried everything till my last breath ,F30
I'll be crying in 5 hours too,F30
I'm alone too    ,F30
I'm finally in a loving relationship and trust me my depression isn't any better  ,F30
At least the delivery man didn't let me down  ' ,F30
Music never fails to comfort me when I'm down ,F30
Well think of it this way  you're just gonna ruin it one way or another so might as well make it quick ,F30

I did the exact same thing  twice a few months ago  And I'm glad now that I didn't go through with it ,F30
Same here    ,F30
You should tell them that you are an adult who can make their own decisions  and you are hurt they they are not there to support you  If they continue this type of behavior I would say to spend less and less time around them  ,F30
I always get my hopes up that things will be better  But then quickly come back down to reality ,F30
The only thing we can count on are that things will remain awful ,F30
"""Be yourself ""  ""Quit being so negative ""  pick one",F30

It's not your fault bud but I do appreciate it ,F30
im gonna do it tbh  its gotten to that point sadly    ,F30
What a meme band  ,F30
You know  You're kinda right  Fuck it you're only alive once in your life so live it up ,F30
Hey I feel this whole post  PM if you need to talk    ,F30
Any  There are millions all over the internet  Discord is becoming a big one  and has some amazing communities  Check out various chatting subs and ones that are interests of yours   ,F30
I think as long as you're not neglecting your responsibilities and you don't do it too long a few days by yourself completely might be a good reboot  ,F30
Don't do anything bad please  Pm me  I've chronic anxiety  recurrent depression  current episode severe  with psychotic symptoms  PTSD and Asperger's   Oh  I'm a recovered alcoholic too  3 years since I last drank ,F30
absolutely I will be doing productive things instead  Thanks for the help ,F30
I'm on Sertraline  Mirtazepine and Olanzepine  All work for me,F30
somehow I am unsure if I keep going because I'm stupid  ,F30
But I never wanna be skilled  I just wanna sleep ,F30
That's bad  Ignore them,F30
My year was ok until a few weeks ago  I am really depressed right now  I just want this year to be over  I need a fresh start ,F30
I'm not sure if you're kidding or not  Could you tell me more about what you mean ,F30
Could you name a few  ,F30
Don't do anything bad please  Pm me  I've chronic anxiety  recurrent depression  current episode severe  with psychotic symptoms  PTSD and Asperger's   Oh  I'm a recovered alcoholic too  3 years since I last drank ,F30
You never know how fast things can turn around  This time last year I was miserable and today I'm happier than I've ever been  Keep up hope   ,F30
Glad it worked for you long term  It seemed to stop working for me  though my powder has been exposed to air for abit too long  it could have degraded  Did it eventually resolve your Anhedonia ,F30
Actually the hospital may allow you to cut off contact   Or encourage it   Its a pretty outstanding perk if your in the mood to be left alone ,F30
"I would say something super bold to them  Like ""have you thought maybe I'm mentally ill and need help instead of teasing "" ",F30
Man sometimes i wonder how we evolved that much with these inneficient brains ,F30
I remember it is not happening now,F30
Happy new year    I hope life gets better for you   ,F30
Is that a maltess  I have 3 of them  ,F30
Man  I feel shit most of the time  I manage to medicate  or numb with alcohol or other shit  but I dont want others to suffer for because of me  sometimes however  the suffering can be overwhelming  for me,F30
"Me too  Even when I do feel intense urges to end it  I still have this thought saying ""what if""  Maybe if I hold out then things will somehow get better one day ",F30
Same to you too    ,F30
Have you tried calling a hotline  ,F30
Yeah mate fucked up New Years with this girl  she's coming around I'm hoping to set things right  not optimistic though,F30
I used to at least like things   I dont like or love anything anymore  not for years   tell me what you despise ,F30
Hey OP  you're awesome too  I hope you all have a happy new year or a new year with plans for change  ,F30
Very true  I've tried to change things  hasn't worked  I'm going to start over  I'm scared and it won't be perfect  but better than what I've been doing  I hope it gets better for you in 2017    ,F30
"YES        It's Always Sunny always makes me laugh so hard  Charlie Day is actually from my home town  One of my favorite episodes ever is the Reynolds VS Reynolds one    ""Oh Sandra  you dumb bitch "" ",F30
I have done the online chat hotline because I was scared of calling and I'm making mistakes with what I've done sure  but I'm trying to improve soon  I'm planning on Starting therapy,F30
It can't be worse either  No matters how bad it gets  at least you have someone who smiles to you everyday  We  the single  lonely people  don't have that ,F30
Thank you very much  I have been thinking of trying Ritalin instead of the Dexedrine Vyvanse which my Doctor prefers ,F30
Yeah we all support you just tell us what's wrong we'll help they've done the same for me it helps makes things clearer,F30
I know it may seem like nobody cares but what if they really do ,F30
You think it helps but it doesn't    It doesn't help when I can't even take care of myself let alone someone else ,F30
Or you could go my way I planned on telling them just go see a counselor tell them and have them tell you're parents explain you're concerns about their reaction,F30
same thing for me  My best friend got back with his ex and suddenly he doesn't seem to put as much effort in our relationship as he used to    it's destroyed me,F30
I'm glad you are starting therapy  that's what helped me when I was really depressed  Do you think you'll be able to hang in there until you see a therapist  ,F30
Well if they do then they have never showed it,F30
Be brave because I'm trying the same there are millions of us Depressed teens you can do it,F30
I'm ready for a fresh start  I've started off the year well  After this post  I got a few really nice and supportive messages from my friends  ,F30
Don't hurt yourself try to get help and heal,F30
I can't tell anymore which year is the worst  They all suck  ,F30
Nope  I tried to tell them  but it's hard ,F30
Go ahead man  I'm here  ,F30
Do you have a date  Can you stay alive until you see your therapist  ,F30
I like to think every natural disaster is Earth's immune system trying get rid of the the cancer  Humans ,F30
Yeah  social media on weekends and nights like this is the fucking worst  Really makes you feel left out and just generally lonely  I've been chilling with my dog tonight  he's a pretty good bud to have around when no one else is,F30
They're just saying enjoy this shit while it last  they care they just suck at showing it ,F30
fuck this the time of the year that makes us feel like fuckin loners ,F30
It's worse because least a job I can quit and find a new one  but I only have this life ,F30
I just keep blowing up silently to myself when these annoying assholes expecting me to give them shit for free ,F30
I didn't actually hurt myself tonight  dark humor only  I've stopped and am seeing a therapist about that  Thank you for the concern though ,F30
You need to stop trying and start living  Stop seeking for acceptance and accept yourself ,F30
I asked a few people if they wanted to hang out  most of them were going out with other friends  and didn't bother to invite me  So guess I'll just be sitting in my room  lol  ,F30
not really into shows but thanks ,F30
Alone here with a pack of fag  ,F30
Fuck 2016 and those people  I hope you find happiness in the new year ,F30
Yay  Fake smiles and selfies everywhere,F30
I related to a lot of what you are saying  especially the part about being tired  I'm sorry you are dealing with all of that  I will listen to you if you have anything to say  ,F30
This year was exhausting    Happy New Year  folks   may it be kind to you all  ,F30
Thanks  good timing reading this,F30
Its because they dont know how to help ,F30
You still have the certification from the course  Why cant you find another similar job  You are probably right to feel screwed over  but it wont do you any good to dwell on it ,F30
   good then,F30
Gotta at least give it a chance,F30
She looks just like the dog I used to have   3 Happy New Year to you both  ,F30
That's not too far away  Can you hold on until then  Make sure you are honest with your therapist about how depressed you are so they can best help you ,F30
Man  you definitely have a right to feel that way  Take it easy on yourself  I hope it'll all get better for you ,F30
Man  you definitely have a right to feel that way  Take it easy on yourself  I hope it'll all get better for you ,F30
It is nuts how people get angry   I've been in full on fights wear I was bored and without enthusiasm  but my bosses have lost it because I was listening to too liberal talk radio   ,F30
That's really shitty and inconsiderate of them to do  ,F30
There are so many people here who just wanna talk to someone and not feel lonely  I wish we could all just get together in a room and hang out for a bit ,F30
Yep I'm home alone   Just browsing the net  mindlessly munching  and I plan to smoke pot a little later on  Probably going to watch a movie or play a game  ,F30
25 and just discovered I'm going bald  Big confidence boost ,F30
Stay positive brother we're all in this together    ,F30
There's a small chance of it happening to anyone ,F30
Relentless  That is what I need to remember  It's not a side effect that will disappear on it's own  ,F30
I'm 22  I found my first grey hair on my head this morning  Crazy  right    It's because I'm so stressed I'm p sure ,F30
This is one of the reasons  4 hurts so bad  I don't want to burden anyone else with being with me ,F30
Fuck yeah  Congratulations on trying your best man that's all that you can do  Cheers ,F30
Oh yeah my cat died also  YEP GOOD YEAR FOR ME ,F30
what is that like a buck in todays currency ,F30
Yes  it makes me think that they are either intellectually lazy  greedy for drug rep benefits  or dangerously stubborn  ,F30
Doesn't mean they should hell at me  ,F30
It's not like we can help it,F30
Same  and no one speaks to me  Vicious cycle ,F30
I can totally relate ,F30
It's disappointing because good days can happen  but somehow they don't last  Well  on the bright side not every day is bad lol ,F30
If you listen to counting crows you're automatically a friend of mine    Definitely one of my favourites  and one of my favourites to show others  Stay awesome,F30
Yes I think I can,F30
Thank  you for the positivity I wish you all the best    ,F30
also thank mr skeltal for good bones and calcium,F30
Well shit  hope you didn't follow through ,F30
Glad to hear it    feel free to message me if you ever need to talk  and don't be afraid to reach out to a hotline or your therapist if you ever feel suicidal again  ,F30
I wish the best for you  Stay devoted and always keep the goal in mind  No matter how hard it is  that feeling of true happiness will always be worth it ,F30
It was my best and worst year all at the same time,F30
This happened to me  but I have a good idea of why  I understand the behavior I did that caused it to happen  but it hurts so bad  ,F30
Im in the same situation  You arent alone ,F30
I'm so sorry    You sound like a very beautiful person and I wish I could get to know you ,F30
Some people are just awful  It's how this world is  I don't know why people choose to be so shitty  but they do  It's dumb but it's just how it is ,F30
I wish we could hang out in real life   ,F30
Motherfucking horses   ,F30
Same dude  Shit sucks  I really hate holidays because they always remember how alone I am ,F30
I am very sad as well   Beat wishes on your your twentieth ,F30
Thanks but it just doesnt get better  It's been months and my bank account is in the red  I just feel so out of solutions at this point ,F30
I love you too and thank you  May 2017 be easier to bear than 2016 for you  for all  ,F30
I want a drunk driver to hit me any night,F30
I would argue with that cocksucking cashier so hard ,F30
"""Put yourself out there "" Seriously  What's the point in putting yourself out there if you're practically invisible or just plain introverted like myself  ",F30
I've been drinking alone this New Year's Eve just like last year so I'm kinda sad and lonely and drunk rn but happy New Years to al of you guys  this is the only subreddit I always feel welcome in  I love you all  ,F30
I love all you internet strangers too  I'm glad we have this place to vent together  Stay strong and have a better new year   Edit  Am drunk too ,F30
Yeah  I feel the same way so I don't know how to help you  I'm sorry you have to go through this shit man ,F30
That's hard  Sometimes there are things about ourselves that feel our of our control    have you ever talked to a therapist    ,F30
Who are you   Who  ,F30
Drinking alone  thinking about texting my ex even though I know it's a bad idea  ,F30
spent mine feeling empty and spacing out on a couch while the people around me cheered and laughed,F30
Invisible  That's exactly how I feel and everybody I tell thinks it's bullshit  A woman's gaze can pass through me without the tiniest pause  I feel like a ghost ,F30
Spent mine feeling wholly out of place in a club  It was the most alone I have ever felt in a  relatively  crowded room ,F30
I too am spending new years alone  I will down my traditional can of coke a cola in your honour bro  Stay positive  and remember that you don't need to be out in groups to be happy and have a good time ,F30
Your so right let me thank him now ,F30
"I love the last few sentences especially "" I will make 2017 my bitch""  Hell yes      I need to be stronger   But 2017  you are mine",F30
What would your favorite song be  I'm quite fond of Another Horsemariner's Dream ,F30
I like that song   ,F30
Don't feel bad me too bud,F30
Same  Happy New Year to you as well,F30
I am here if you need to talk  just send me a PM ,F30
Same situation here  Sucks  doesn't it    ,F30
Me too  friend ,F30
There is always help   Please PM me  and we can talk ,F30
There is no need to end your life  I promise   PM me  and I will talk about anything you want ,F30
Well then ask them why they don't invite you  They may just think you're not interested ,F30
God dammit I wish I could stop giving a fuck  I try so hard but it every now and then it hurts to be so lonely ,F30
Way to take that rejection and keep going  Congrats ,F30
I very often hope a bomb crash on my house ,F30
What a cute pup  Dogs are the fucking best ,F30
Happy New Year  I'm drunk and on Reddit  Wishing all of  r depression the best for 2017 ,F30
Wow it's been 5 years of depression  Can't wait for another year of dying inside ,F30
People on the internet are much different of how they are in real life  ,F30
I've been trying to get that fresh start  For years  It never came ,F30
Just know that there is no such thing as 'being normal'  I encourage you to spend some time with family  Being with anyone is better than being alone  ,F30
So cute     Dogs really are so special and can soothe us in so many ways  Please tell your pup that I think he is very handsome     ,F30
110  worth it ,F30
"Mac's whole evolution argument science is a liar sometimes was brilliant  the whole episode really    ""He created a reasonable doubt  he makes you sound like a stupid science bitch """,F30
Miserable alone  together ,F30
The thought makes me ill ,F30
I've learned some people are just not made for interaction  It's sucks buts true,F30
There is a story I'd like to tell you  please feel free to shoot me a PM if you're interested ,F30
  I encourage you to spend some time with family   I'd attempt that if they weren't so drunk and rowdy already  All they are doing is annoying me  At least they're having fun with themselves  i guess,F30
Anything can happen in 2017  Happy new year to you and I hope this one won't be a waste,F30
I know it's hard as things change   Please feel free to shoot me a PM if you need someone to talk to tonight ,F30
God this is me  I need to stop being a pathetic sack of shit too  I don't think it's very realistic for me though  ,F30
I'm sorry your night didn't turn out like you hoped  I'm alone here as well  unless you count my dog and two asshole cats  My only real friend is 1500 miles away  so I'm enjoying a nice beer and perusing reddit ,F30
A Long December is my current favourite  But Another Horse Dreamers Blues is awesome  Mr Jones was the song that got me started  because my local pop radio actually played it  and I fell in love ,F30
There's always an answer to escape suicide  You may not know it  but why not live and find out ,F30
I'm glad you made it   It's not an easy road to change  and your mind will fight you the entire time you're trying  but just take it one step at a time   You'll get there if you believe in yourself ,F30
"I want to say it ""helps"" that I don't get my hopes up anymore  but these years of not looking forward to anything have just made me more dead inside  ",F30
Thank you for responding and not being an ass like the other guy that commented in ,F30
I was guessing based on the two symptoms I mentioned but you'd need to speak with the doctor  ,F30
see my other response to a similar suggestion,F30
Can't upvote this hard enough  I quit Facebook a couple years a go and am so glad I did  It's just a filter for showing all the amazing shit in people's lives and making you feel like a loser ,F30
Fucking salad cured my depression    Thanks for the laugh ,F30
Happy new years   What a shitty year  hope you all are doing alright  Don't got high hopes for 2017  waiting for 2018 to come by already ,F30
That's the sad part  The BS isnt over  Its 100  going to spill in 2017 ,F30
i dunno what to feel about this but  okay  stay strong buddy,F30
Im very sorry to hear that but death is not the answer  Have you tried getting professional help for your depression ,F30
Anything you like to do  Or distracts you for a bit  Could always just sleep too  ,F30
     Feel bad   Never sleep near people ,F30
Its just a number  life will keep its same course  the number has no signifcancy i fear,F30
Medication helps too I guess   ,F30
Spot on  I just don't want to hurt anymore ,F30
I would love that ,F30
Why must life be so hard   Why must I fail af every attempt at masonry ,F30
have no friends due to social anxiety and moving to a new state and parents would rather hang out with their high school friends than stay with me   ,F30
"""it's okay to be alone on new years eve""  Nah man  it isn't   It sucks ",F30
I hear ya  Would listening to more upbeat music help  Even cheesy silly shit,F30
I love that feeling  I know the isolation is bad for me but sitting unnoticed in a bar or club is somehow more isolating than being alone in the wilderness  ,F30
I meant Another Horsedreamer's Blues  I got it combined with a story lol   The two you listed are awesome as well  I love Possibility Days  as said  and God Of Ocean Tides,F30
Hey  me too ,F30
No offence taken understand you I feel the same ,F30
Another year expecting things to change and feeling isolated and alone as usual  someone just please make this stop    ,F30
Look you  whats the worst an awake human can do to you   So fuck you   ,F30
First things first  cut the sad music  no need to make yourself feel sad  It's 2017 and there's hope for new opportunities that can present itself to you  hopefully ones that can make you happy ,F30
Life is like a cult,F30
Good luck  I hope you can find something you can relate to soon ,F30
Yes  those are great songs  I mainly listen to Counting Crows and Eric Clapton actually  Especially Eric's songs about the passing of his son  they are so deep and meaningful to me   And his guitar playing doesn't hurt   ,F30
I wonder how many of these you guys ticked off the list  I have atleast 5 of those ,F30
I'm glad that you are    ,F30
This was year was also the worst year of my life  I've had depression for a long time but this entire was just terrible suffering  I hope to god it's better in 2017  but I doubt it ,F30
  hugs back  ,F30
i dunno where you're coming from with that post  help me understand ,F30
Youll get used to it eventually  At first you might be bitter from loneliness but maybe you wont mind it    in a few years ,F30
Shit  I just started watching Sunny for the first tome and saw that one last night  Love it ,F30
Good luck  It's good you're staying positive  Hope you find a good therapist and you can get something out of it  ,F30
Imeab the bbq ibstructions werw complex at h best,F30
That sounds good  the turnaround   I wasn't into going to a NYE party  Good conversations like that can't be beat ,F30
They are projecting their frustration on you  because that is easier than confronting their own feelings  ,F30
Nihilism will help  I turned to it as an excuse for my depression but it's just led me to try and improve my life  ,F30
most people that give those tips are people that have likely been sociable for quite some time and don't really see the other side of the story  or they haven't been depressed in so long they don't realize what it feels like anymore ,F30
What's your favorite CC song ,F30
There's only fire  ,F30
 Somehow newyears is rhe worst,F30
I'm so sorry  I don't know what I'd do without my dog  I know they can't be replaced  but can you get another one ,F30
Kicked off the new year with another social rejection and feeling ignored as usual  Yay  ,F30
Me too  I used to be paralyzed with it  My friends are off getting their Master's  getting married and so on  I'm just trying to figure it out  A lot of people are in the same boat  if it helps  ,F30
RIP 2015  2014  and 2013  You guys will always be missed ,F30
It's hard  I'm trying my damnedest  One step at a time  I guess  ,F30
Crying at the start of the New Year  Oh how fucking auspicious ,F30
"There is no ""supposed to""",F30
"sometimes I can't help but think ""hit me hit me hit me hit me"" when I'm walking in front of a car that eventually stops  maybe one day it won't stop  ",F30
I dont know  I eat healthy  I do meditation  I try to see people  I dont take antidepressants and I just feel like there's no end  It's just the purgatory constantly no matter what ,F30
Did you read my diary  I wish you all the luck in this new year  ,F30
I was trying to disconnect my dead water softener and almost flooded the garage  Took a nice hot shower  started the fire and had a good beer  Trying not to think about all the fun the rest of the world is having ,F30
Man  fuck social media ,F30
I feel like I'm in the exact same situation and I want to change that in 2017  I have no idea how though  Fml  ,F30
I was like that for a while a few months ago but it's really starting to pile on and I can't ignore it anymore  ,F30
I guess its on me to wait until I find something that interests me  Thanks  means a lot    ,F30
Hang in there  I hope you find the strength to make the changes you need ,F30
I'm so sorry you lost your friend  I hope you can find someone to talk to about it  I really think it could help ,F30
please don't  Things an change  Things  will  change  ,F30
Absolutely brilliant show  Watch it from the beginning since they frequently refer to past episodes actor characteristics  First season is good  but probably the least interesting  Then season two  Danny Devito joins and every episode from then on is hilarious ,F30
Eh  people suck anyways  Just pick a few you like and hang on tight     Happy new year  ,F30
Hope 2017 is a great one for you as well ,F30
It's nothing  just another weekly depressive episode   Thanks for asking though,F30
I'm into S3 now  Loving it ,F30
I was thinking this just now   ,F30
There are support groups in many places  I've been going to Refuge Recovery groups despite not having addiction issues  There might be ones even more geared towards depression ,F30
Sadly I don't think he knows the difference  He's just a spiteful little shit who gets off on the pain of others  I mean he's enjoying the feelings of depression that urgeless is feeling right now  ,F30
we are here for you man,F30
Ill post the math theorem here once the whole issue is resolved  It will make me feel better  ,F30
Hope it gets better ,F30
Everyone has different personalities when they're with friends than when they're alone or at home  so try not to overthink or worry too much until your appointment  Explain to your doctor and I'm sure they can help you more     Good luck ,F30
I practice mostly Vipassana but I try to do some Metta  I have a hard time forgiving myself so doing Metta is a challenge for me ,F30
If this was a job  I would blackmail the boss ,F30
Happy New Year to you too ,F30
Thank you for the response     Things are hard though  '   I'm very sure I'm not gonna get through January sadly   ,F30
Fuck I was just gonna say this,F30
I'm so proud of you ,F30
Hey  can you come back to this post  OP accidentally replied to themselves not you ,F30
I really hope things get better  If no one is there for you  then we are  damn it  Please don't ,F30
Well he came back  Pretty sure he's fucking wasted though  Awesome    ,F30
Have you taken anything  darling ,F30
2015 was awful for me  2016 was awful for me  and now I'm terrified for this year,F30
Sadly a clock change does not change the mind ,F30
How do you feel about writing down what you're too afraid to say  I find that that helps me with that ,F30
wish some people on this sub would understand that more  Being told to just play games to cope doesn't work when you remember how shitty video games are compared to other things in life ,F30
How come  darling ,F30
You really are a pathetic waste of skin ,F30
You're not going through the same thing you shit heap  Now go laugh at rape victims like you always do ,F30
i would  but i cant organize thoughts enough to hold a conversation  sorry,F30
For me 2015 was the worst year and 2016 was damn near perfect up until the end  2017 just looks to continue this miserable path I'm on ,F30
Who was  u Pizzachu1 mocking for being raped as a child ,F30
The one supplement with the most consistent effect for me is sarcosine  1 5 grams daily and you're out of depression within a week  sometimes less  ,F30
I would like therapy  it can't afford it  And meditations make me nervous,F30
Mine is to find a reason to live  Because I honestly don't think I'll still be alive to see 2018 ,F30
Do you have this  darling ,F30
What did you take ,F30
"The ""this year is going to be better mentality"" is really exhausting ",F30
Are you still with us ,F30
I hope you get the help you need OP  Hugs to you and hope you have a better 2017    ,F30
It's not just pain   it's numbness  loneliness  sadness  It's no happiness  I don't want to avoid it I just can't take it anymore  ,F30
Never a bad thing to share and reflect I guess  For whatever it's worth  here's to a better new year  ,F30
Hell yes  let's own this year ,F30
I'm here for you  what's going on ,F30
Hanging yourself is not an option   No self harm is   Call suicide hotline and talk to someone    You are overwhelmed  we all are,F30
I hope you can find your reason to live  I didn't think I'd be alive to see 2017  but somehow I made it  although I can't say I've found a reason to live yet  Stay strong ,F30
I ask myself this everyday  ,F30
Going through a similar thing  I think about her everyday it eats away at me but i still love her,F30
I am here alone too  Just listening to classical music  It always makes me go to a land of fantasy  D ,F30
I try to alternate weeks  one week I post a call for ideas  and the week after is when the assignment actually starts  I used to do this on Fridays but then accidentally it drifted to Thursdays ,F30
Had an awful suicidal 2016  Hoping for a better 2017  when a few minutes in  my girl friend said she lost feelings for me  Guess I gotta wait till 2018  ,F30
How do you know your ugly ,F30

Dude  I cleaned my room a month ish ago  not 100  clean  but def cleaner than before  for the first time since I was diagnosed  And it's still clean  ,F30
its main ingredient  mitragynin  is an opioid  and as such its addictive ,F30
Because I don't like how I look ,F30
Hi friend  Its 1 04 where I am  I'm just checking in,F30
Wish I had the courage to take my own life and make 2017 be my last year but I can't even do that,F30
Had an awful suicidal 2016  Hoping for a better 2017  when a few minutes in  my girl friend said she lost feelings for me  Guess I gotta wait till 2018  ,F30
It's not like that  I've been in 73 hospitals this year  Its not like i've been here a few days  My illnesses don't have a cure,F30
If you haven't achieved it yet maybe you should make your resolutions things that would make you happy  That's what I've learned about myself   I need to become independent and live my own life before I can be happy  Also self improvement  ,F30
Love you too man  happy new year ,F30
Bout 40 sleeping spills so far and idk how many shots of vodka I know its hard to die from sleeping pills but im keeping mynfkngers crossed ,F30
Don't listen to those jerks  People who say to just get over it doesn't understand depression  ,F30
Tonight this runs through my head 3 times per second   You could die right here and no one would know for over a week  I have no one left and it's starting to really scare me  ,F30
Thanks for sharing  I have some Sarcosine on hand but have not yet experimented  Have you tried Agmatine  If so  how does it compare to Sarcosine  Personally  it has helped me quite a bit  despite the stubborn nature of my anhedonia  ,F30
If you haven't already  you should see a psychiatrist   ,F30
I dunno how to get help,F30
I've been putting it off for a year now but I think I'll go and see one soon  thanks for reading ,F30
Description shows psychosis symptoms  Get help or you could loose months trying to march this off ,F30
What exactly do you consider wrong about your appearance   It is an intrusive question  You don't have to answer if you don't want to ,F30
I was alone  Thank you ,F30
You do deserve it  and I sincerely hope that things change in your favor for the new year  No one deserves to feel like they have no purpose  or a pointless life that they're stuck with  I'm rooting for you  man  ,F30
Don't  Give  Up  ,F30
this hurts so much do you really think she drank is there any chance she didnt  we have been in this relationship for two years,F30
Hugs to you OP  How are you under attack  Verbally or Physically  I hope God grants you the strength to continue and endure until you find the right path ,F30
Exact same place right now  20 and all,F30
  The women I'm confident around I'm not attracted to  and the women I'm attracted to are too good for me   I have this problem as well   ,F30
Just hang in there  You can do it  It will be worth it once the side effects wear off  and they will wear off  The worst is usually only about a week ,F30
You sound like a beautiful person  And I am not talking about appearance  but rather your character  You want to be healthier to help others  and that is something I truly admire in you  The world needs more people like you ,F30
What kind of shows are those ,F30
Fuck same and every birthday wish I make as well ,F30
Had an awful suicidal 2016  Hoping for a better 2017  when a few minutes in  my girl friend said she lost feelings for me  Guess I gotta wait till 2018  ,F30
That's terrible advice  ,F30
Same  I actually thought I was going to have plans  for once  but he decided to hang out with some other people instead  ,F30
I feel ya man  Had an awful suicidal 2016  Hoping for a better 2017  when a few minutes in  my girl friend said she lost feelings for me  Guess I gotta wait till 2018  ,F30
I wonder the same ,F30
I feel ya man  I love this sub because it's helpful to know people out there are going through the same thing ,F30
I'm an existentialist  which is basically just a slightly more optimistic nihilist  Nothing matters  but we can basically give things meaning ourselves  even if it's just bullshit ,F30
Yup  Today has been horrible  ,F30
I'm doing the exact same thing    classical and standards  ,F30
I hope this year treats you well  Thank you for saying this  ,F30
Happy new year's to you ,F30
Happy new year  I hope it treats you well   ,F30
Great idea  I'm going for a drive ,F30
I've got a loaded 30 06 in the closet   One bullet in the chamber for me   I look at it from time to time but I'm too afraid to even touch it ,F30
Every year that I'm still alive is a bad year ,F30
Same  I'm pathetic  ,F30
You can tell us your story  if you want  Nobody is here to judge you ,F30
Thanks  I don't really know what undepressed people do that I don't though   ,F30
Love you back  happy new year ,F30
It's not that bad     if you can afford it  Maybe return it if you can ,F30
Pretty similar  I'm usually drinking hot tea or ice cold water  watch a movie catch up on a tv show  or read on my kindle   Reddit all day ,F30
I doubt you've had the best tasting meal on the planet ,F30
Start by leaving the toilet    That's for sure going to make you feel worse  Put the bottle down and get some water  ,F30
Love you too  stranger   Honestly  I just come here when I'm depressed because giving others advice makes me feel better  This sub helps me more than I could ask for  ,F30
I've been feeling really hollow and empty the past week  The past 6 weeks I feel like i've just stalled and it's unbearable at times    I wish I could just turn my mind off when I want to ,F30
Be yourself  Yeah OK  which one  ,F30
Get off the alcohol and any drugs  they destroy everything  stop drinking and taking pills it's all bullshit  trust me  All they do is make it worse  especially when you're trying to quit    ,F30
Because you still have hope left in you  You want to be happy  It's still possible  It might take a lot of work  but you can do it    Oh  and you're awesome  ,F30
Try inviting them to hangout next time  Sometime you have to grasp the moment and not let it come because it never will ,F30
I've not found that to be the case   Though that's not to say that working hard is any better ,F30
Wait five years  9 times out of 10 you'll be happier later  You just have to stick around through the rough  ,F30
"Yeah  but that's like saying ""enjoy being stabbed while it lasts because you won't get stabbed forever"" ",F30
Oh definitely shouldn't put it off if you haven't tried it yet  I started dealing with panic attacks early last January  Started taking meds in March  Meds definitely help  ,F30
Oh for fuck's sake ,F30
I have no other way to say this other than it'll only hurt more if you don't try  Look if you keep doing this  college will  no  it is the same except you have freedom ,F30
Thank you  wish the same for you ,F30
yeah  I take meds for depression and anxiety  and I liked it cause i was better  But now they just make me feel worse and weak  idk how to explain it,F30
"Understandable  But when your 60yo  and you look back at your life  I guarantee you'll say ""I wish I asked them to hangout"" ",F30
I can relate with all u just said  I wanna get rid of my brain too   I fucking hate depression ,F30
I had a similar experience today  I asked people to hang out today for New Years  also a senior  and was turned down by everyone  then found out later people I had asked went somewhere else to hang with each other,F30
Good job bro  we're proud of you ,F30
Do people get texts like that  I haven't gotten a single one either ,F30
I'm fucked up so this is hard   I still haven't seen Magic Beasts and Where to Find Them  Or Jessica Jones  There's a donut place I still want to go to  ,F30
I'm down  SpookyMulder 1697,F30
If you were motivated to do something  you aren't a nihilist by definition ,F30
This is exactly how I feel,F30
Heard   But there's a video game I want to play coming out in June  And there's the new Jumanji and Wonder Woman movie   But I feel like I'll still have the same shitty job and shitty life  Yay  ,F30
I'm just scared and I don't know how to get through this  ,F30
I came here hoping other people would be checking in  Nice to know there's others doing the same  ,F30
Please don't encourage people who violate the community rules  ,F30
Happy new year     ,F30
I know how that feels    people are shitty sometimes,F30
Happy New Year  ,F30
That was a great read  thank you  ,F30
Much love man  3 ,F30
"I don't think most 13 year olds' ""emotional issues"" comprise contemplating suicide  Suicidal ideation is a serious issue and anyone who mentions it should be taken seriously ",F30
Any books  movies  or sources you recommend to get more insight on this  ,F30
I don't know what you're going through but that's exactly how I feel right now ,F30
Happy New Year  ,F30
I wish it made me happy all the time  I'd have a reason to drink what I do  GOod luck buddy ,F30
Have you considered that it might just have been a misunderstanding    Besides  you have Internet  so there is lot of ways to entertain yourself XD,F30
Might be side effects  Worth mentioning to your doctor about it and possibly try something else,F30
Had been going great since the summer  School had been keeping me busy  i got back together wuth my girlfriend and was doing ok  Idk what happened last night    just feeling pretty hollow now  Meh ,F30
What happened here   o O,F30
Are you regretting anything specific  or is it just a general sense of regret about nothing in particular  those are always fun   ,F30
I'm sorry you feel this  I have it too right now and I can say it's not fun at all  If you need to vent I'm here   and hope you find some solace somewhere,F30
They're all being deleted ahaha I don't know why  it'll happen in the next few minutes   EDIT  Seems this is the only comment not deleted haha ,F30
Hey man he's just trying to see if the person is still there  Don't bash him for asking a question ,F30
6 for me yay ,F30
Hi  We can talk ,F30
Happy new year my man  I'm here like we survived 2016  Give me a medal  shit  ,F30
Honestly man I feel like we were unlucky enough to develop defective brains one way or another  I'm like that defective product of nature that should be dead but medications are keeping me alive ,F30
"Yep  losing contact to 3 people who are close to me means that I have no one to express my feelings to anymore  That much regarding ""friends forever"" ",F30
I feel you  Having same exact problem here too  Trying to fix it but no solutions to be seen   ,F30
why the late reply ,F30
Read it  Don't apologize  You came to the right place I think  I'm too terrified to tell my parents  The one person I told  he blew me off  I think I'll keep it to myself from now on  ,F30
Maybe this will be worth nothing but watch six feet under  you reminded me of Keith ,F30
Fuck 2016  You are  not alone man  My 10 year old cat died this  year  I couldn't wait everyday to get home and see her and now she's gone  wtf  ,F30
Yep  being around negativity really does worsen your mood  That's why I hate the negative circle jerks that sometimes show up  makes me start thinking that way alittle  Maybe try to keep the mood lighter  change subjects ,F30
I laughed the loudest who'd have known  T T,F30
It's not just me    Congrats  Maybe I'll work on it this year ,F30
I love dark humor so  i upvote ,F30
My birthday's not in march but besides that I could have made this post  I really think something drastic might happen soon  I can feel myself getting worse and becoming much more comfortable with the idea of suicide,F30
on the bright side you don't really keep in touch with people from highschool when your older    plenty of time to make some weird friends in college and have weird fun stories with ,F30
Blow my nose  lol  and then just lay down and sleep  ,F30
Alcohol only works with social stuff and making me laugh a bit more at comedy stuff like it's always sunny if it would make me happy I would be probably be an alcoholic lol ,F30
oh what i'd do to be like you  I feel like everything is and would be awry for me  that my pain would pile up and become unbearable ,F30
there is always  r SuicideWatch too  Lets hope none of us needs any of these services though,F30
I commented in another thread of yours with a recommendation but also wanted to ask if you've tried meditation ,F30
I felt the same way for a really long time   You don't know when things will change  so just keep going   ,F30
Same here just waiting to turn 21 and drink myself to death  ,F30
Thank you   I will continue the meds and hopefully I'm able to feel better  Happy new  year  ,F30
S2 is when things started to derail  in a good way  I still hope to see dennis go absolutely mental or something haha ,F30
Agent 47 disagrees with your views ,F30
Anything any of us can do  Like reminders or anything ,F30
What more can i do  I am forced to keep going  I have to live in misery ,F30
Discord or rabb it are pretty good for virtual hanging out,F30
2017 used depression   it's super effective  Sorry had to do it  I am sorry you feel that way ,F30
I've been at it for hours  sure is wonderful             'sarcasm',F30
Yeah I'd easily rank it as the worst year of my life as well  I feel like I won't try to go through the next year,F30
Honestly quitting a job that makes you miserable is a great idea  It's better to find something else first  Makes things less stressful  Things might not be awesome after  but they'll improve marginally if you get out of a toxic environment  ,F30
"The idea of ""love"" as we know it today is a by product of romanticism anyway ",F30
Living in misery with the chance of being happy   I wish you well,F30
Did you write a note ,F30
You can try looking at r latestagecapitalism  I believe they have some reading material in their sidebar  ,F30
what did you do ,F30
Maybe  I mean  I don't really think so  It's that life is inherently  without meaning  but it's possible to give it meaning  Even if it's not much  I can do something no matter how small the impact  ,F30
Well that's one fear I hope you never conquer  my friend  ,F30
Thank you for sharing  It's not always as easy as it may sound,F30
Good luck with your therapist visit  ,F30
Not OP but I've tried both agmatine and sarcosine for that lingering anhedonia  I didn't get much from either  but I don't think I gave them a proper trial  Would you mind sharing your protocol for agmatine ,F30
Sometimes being with people who make you feel alone is just as bad as being alone  ,F30
Well the question would be what do I have left   And the answer is not much  I recently got a cat so I can't kill myself but that's the only good thing I can see  ,F30
Dude I was asleep alone in my room at 11 35 pm  Feels bad when I woke up 6 hours later  ,F30
If your looking for a sad message then your going to find it   ,F30
I see a lot of monsters   ,F30
To live a stable life and to be happy ,F30
Funny  I want to die bc of my parents,F30
Glad there is someone here for me ,F30
I never thought I would die alone ,F30
Hey just listen  Don't get carried away   ,F30
If when you get a chance ask your psychiatrist directly  it's best to get this information from the horse's mouth  so to speak ,F30
"why does ""depression"" have it's own subreddit  that is literally the saddest thing ever    I guess it doesn't matter anyways    BTW  I'm joking  ",F30
A subreddit for depressed people should be their moto xd,F30
I was the driver with a passenger  I didn't even feel fear for him while this was happening   something I'm not used to   Normally I care way more about other people than myself  ,F30
Month ago I told myself I would jump off the bridge on the 31st  Fucking ass nugget I'm still here ,F30
I was too tired at the time I posted that comment and I did the maths in a wrong way ,F30
I have a hard time brushing my teeth when I am depressed too  Good job ,F30
Do you know how long the wait is ,F30
Hang in there  I know that sounds cliche but seriously,F30
you got some Internet buds here  have a happy new year  ,F30
Yea I think you're right  You're really good at reading into things  o  Whether or not my lack of emotion is a good or bad thing is something for me to decide I guess    ,F30
My crush didnt invite me to a party,F30
Does she know you like her  and even then this isn't the end of the world bro you'll find someone eventually  I believe in you,F30
"""Deep in earth my love is lying  and I must weep alone "" ",F30
Meant alone  Not saline in the title ,F30
Yes she does and she only see's me as a friend  I can't handle it  I want to end my life,F30
Hey don't kill yourself over such a small matter you'll have time to talk and you'll have time to talk about your feelings it just takes time you just have to be patient,F30
I can't t tell you how much that resonates with me  What happened to my emotions they're missing  ,F30
It's gonna be a year of major change  dude  Hang in there  this is gonna be one wild motherfucking roller coaster of a ride  And I'm ready ,F30
Thank you for your kind words  I hope so too   ,F30
Good bye  I hope you got some pleasure from this fucked up world ,F30
yeah the cycle is quite frustrating  thank you though    ,F30
Hell is individual to each person  you can disagree all you want but you can't deny that in OP's world he probably is in hell ,F30
You're an amazing person  I'm glad you're doing well ,F30
Can I just trade body with any female no matter which skin color or orientation   Have you seen Sense8  It's on Netflix  Pretty good and also about different people with other perspectives ,F30
I believe you can do it  I want you to have a good year and if you need support through the rough times  hit me up through reddit  Your brother in humanity is all that I am ,F30
Yeah and the worst part is your suck in this body for life  This is all you got in this world  There's no choosing  it is what it is unfortunately ,F30
There's no reason for any of this  I don't get why we are even alive wtf is this shit  It's all about how much you can personally take before giving in to the endless dark void of mystery  I'm right on the  cusp right now ,F30
I totally get it man I'm in that same place  I can't decide if I want to continue on in this weird world or not ,F30
I get the same thing sometimes  Don't feel embarrassed  i'm sure they will understand what you were going through   ,F30
I'm sorry man  I am in a similar boat  I've just realized you can't pick who you are in this world and whatever you get is what your stuck with  Either you learn to accept yourself or give in and end it all  ,F30
Shit man  we can talk ,F30
It hurts so much she post snapchats off herself at a house party  I can't fucking take it  ,F30
I read the whole thing and I'm in a similar boat  ,F30
same  i need to as well,F30
You just have to be strong these things come and go,F30
Yep  Fuck ugliness ,F30
My birthdays in March too  want to talk about anything ,F30
at 12 00 i was with all ym friends and they told me they were all goinghome after hanging and at 2 00 they were all at some party wihtout me     i felt so horrible,F30
You'll find it  ,F30
2016 was the worst for me too  but cmon bro    2017 will be great  Everyone can do it  so can we ,F30
Maybe this year  you  will  be ,F30
I wanted to go to sleep too but then all the fireworks and noise   ,F30
And fuck the world that makes people with brains like ours need to feel lonely and isolated  The world can and should do better by us,F30
No problem  they just do that to be huge trolls but don't necessarily understand the consequences sometimes  I hope you have a great new year ,F30
Hey  Unfriend her and just focus on yourself  It will hurt less one day  trust me  ,F30
Wow    This really isn't the place to be a troll  Move onto another subreddit  please ,F30
I'm so confused  Anyway  happy new year  Your message was really nice  made me smile   wishing you all the best  3,F30
That's awesome  As someone who also struggles with mundane tasks due to depression  I commend you for making good on your goal ,F30
I would message the mods  At least one of them has been trained to work a suicide hotline which is desperately needed  I'm so glad to hear you're doing better    ,F30
i don't mean to be that guy but just so you know  it's  u  for users and  r  for subreddits  you're awesome  happy new year ,F30
Please do everyone a favor and bring all of your pets to a no kill shelter  they deserve better than you ,F30
Oh I'm glad to read that  you too ,F30
I hate when I am having thoughts like these  and I have even acted on a few of them  What I did to help reduce the risk of hurting myself is adopt emergency measures  such as ice cream or my favorite tv show  ,F30
Thanks  I was looking at the anatomy of the brain to find the part of my head I should shoot before finding this place ,F30
How do I return it ,F30
I'm with you  I'm not doing 30  I'm done ,F30
I am all of those   ,F30
There's no competition for me  I've already lost ,F30
It's not like they really mean it  I mean some literally type one standard message and send it to everyone  I literally got one single message from a guy I haven't seen in 4 years and forgot he even existed  ,F30
Thank you  Honestly very reassuring to hear  I've got a few friends with various mental health issues so I've learned a thing or two about how to not completely suck  but I still feel a little lost sometimes ,F30
HUGS  Its okay  we got your back ,F30
Be glad that you still have goals and dreams  Follow them ,F30
At least you can still cry  I've been alone for so long I'm longing for it    not the loneliness tho  Paradox I know ,F30
That's awesome man  That and a daily shower help so much  Invest time in yourself  You're worth it ,F30
it's an on and off type of thing  sometimes i dont do it becasuse i feel like i dont deserve it,F30
Masturbate  PRN meds and a whole heap of distractions ,F30
Touch your dog and you're toast you little shit,F30
This just made my year,F30
"Oh my gosh  I didn't even think the reason I ""forget"" to rush my teeth might be my depression  That or I just don't remember ",F30
An anti depressant combined with therapy works well  To assume that only one thing is a cure is a grey area in mental health  ,F30
Happy New Year to you too  Rob ,F30
it's ok  I appreciate it anyway,F30
I guess at this point all we can really do is put our head down  charge forward and forget our feelings until it gets better  That seems like my number one option right now,F30
I wish I could cry it hurts so much having everything holed up inside but you can't let it out,F30
Detonate a a bunch of nukes right on top of Yellowstone to trigger its supervolcano sending the earth into another ice age from all the ash blocking out the sun or something idk ,F30
Tonight Reddit was my special someone,F30
Good job  Maybe you could reward yourself with something that doesn't cost anything  Like a walk in the park  or you could check out a museum you haven't seen before  If you're into that sort of thing     ,F30
I brush my teeth in the shower  If you're gonna be standing there for a while waiting for your hair to get wet or leaving conditioner in for a minute  might as well brush your teeth while you wait ,F30
I just want to give you a hug right now thank you  ,F30
Happy new years to you too  Here's to hoping 2017 is better  ,F30
thank you so much  if you need someone to talk to you can always hit me up as well  im on reddit quite a lot ,F30
This is too real  Wow  Well done OP  You did good ,F30
Right there with you  My life dramatically collapsed  it's now significantly smaller  The holidays are a great way to measure how things are going  They are not going well  This is probably my last Christmas ,F30
I went to bed at 11  woke up at 7  Checked phone  no text messages  ,F30
You should watch a good TV show  It's a great waste of time and its certainly better than watching random videos  I recommend The Wire or The Sopranos  ,F30
More people than you'd expect  Even if they don't know how to show it ,F30
I should be apologizing  not you  It seems you're concerns are definitely warranted  Sorry  friend  ,F30
Actually women are more prone to depressive episodes than men  ,F30
Well  I suppose you're right  Thank you for that  thank you very much ,F30
Idc  I hate this body  And it wouldn't matter anyways   And women are at least more able to ask for help  But nvm  I don't want to start anything here ,F30
That's why it's a practice  Good luck ,F30
As someone who just hit major dental pain from not brushing for years  you will definitely thank yourself  I've had kidney stones  too  and I really don't know which is worse    Congrats for sticking with your goal ,F30
Of course not  Please take this day for yourself to recover  Try not to be so anxious about calling off either  Have you ever tried meditation  It's been the only thing to help me with my anxiety and depression  ,F30
Yeah man  I can get 99  right and all I see is that one wrong  it consumes me and drives me to madness  I am not 'happy' unless I see something wrong with myself ,F30
I agree with you  But if you don't understand me then don't underestimate my pain  When you do this  it's just growing my pain and growing my despair   this was for them  not for you ,F30
Glad too hear that you are still alive  but sad to hear that you're still suffering  May I ask if you know why you are in such a dark place ,F30
Take care of yourself ,F30
I used to get this while running  Using an elliptical  which gives your body some momentum  helps  while exercising  ,F30
I like to sleep but I don't sleep well,F30
Yup  And yet you want it so much  Such a vicious self deprecating circle  ,F30
Aw I'm so sorry   but you're not gonna through this alone  Every time I got my heart broken  it made me a stronger person  so I'll be praying and hoping your 2017 will be better after this day  ,F30
Hey  I wish you a very happy new year   ,F30
Thank god I'm not the only one struggling with such a mundane task  I'm so happy to hear that you managed to brush everyday   you really deserve a reward  well done ,F30
Well hello I hope you're feeling a little better today  The suns shining for the first time in a few days here  It's cold  but nice  The type of winter day I enjoy  ,F30
Sense8 is great  Did you watch the Christmas special  And I think season 2 comes out in a few months  ,F30
I know plenty of people who swear by their meds  so no shame in trying ,F30
having fillings done as a child without anesthetic ensured i brushed my teeth every day    that shit is so fucking painful,F30
Whenever it's at night for me  probably because I'm alone and stuck with my thoughts around these times   ,F30
Not yet  I will watch it this evening ,F30
I've been trying and I've had no luck  Most people who match me unmatch me before we even talk  ,F30
Same here  It's like a coin flip  Except both sides of the coin are tails for suicide  ,F30
you get an espresso machine  you prepare espresso a night before  you put it right next to your bed to be drunk in the morning    ,F30
Slept forever  Wish I could go back to that  Got a call from my sister  otherwise I'd forget I existed  ,F30
Yep  All I've been thinking about this morning  Only thing keeping me alive is my crippling anxiety  ,F30
The benefits suck and it's every hour of every day  The closest thing I can find to a vacation is a fifth of gin  ,F30
Couldn't even drink alone because my most recent bender has fucked up my stomach too much to hold down anything other than water  ,F30
You need professional help  not a subreddit  ,F30
Glad you're not depressed anymore but I don't think that's what the army is for ,F30
That is great   D,F30
yeah   shame I can't apply for US army     but whatever the aussie army does i wont be bored and depressed anymore,F30
Same  Lets hope we are wrong  I will try stay optimistic for 2017,F30
I'd rather kill myself violently in front of my friends or family  Once I drop out of college I am ending this pathetic life of mine  ,F30
I don't either  How can he like the pain of someone like him  If he believes pedos are oppressed why mock urgeless  He doesn't respect real pain but wants to call himself the vicitm  ,F30
It's no big deal  there are hundreds of different meds  If the ones you're on aren't doing it for you  tell your doc you want to try a different option  ,F30
Wanna go for a coffee on the 5th ,F30
That's good  I think once you enlist  you'll find some sort of greater purpose and it'll help you find your place in the world  Good luck to you   ,F30
I've been on meds off meds been to psychiatrist   Like I just give up and don't care ,F30
i started to learn how to code  ,F30
Good job  OP   3,F30
I'm proud of you  OP   People don't realise how much effort it actually is to have personal hygiene ,F30
Yep  it's kinda cliche  I think  but I always feel like an eternal observer  It's like I'm trapped in time and I see things again and again and I don't even want to live them  I'm just staring at it ,F30
Yeah sure I'll go for a coffee  thanks  I arrive in Dam around 1 30pm,F30
i know python and a little of c  and java  ,F30
One step at a time  OP  It may seem like a small thing but it's actually  very important  Proud of you  3,F30
The story of a lot of people here  I think  Most people don't really like to do that  but generally if you're just being used  you should filter those people out of your life,F30
its great to take small steps  keep up the good work ,F30
Live for nothing  or die for something   salutes ,F30
I didn't get one   I'm about at the cut off age for that kind of stuff though   Plus I didn't send any so there's that   I find sending them gets about 1 3 response rate in previous years ,F30
I have not had a Monster energy today   And I guess I'll go brush my teeth,F30
That's a good use of water  too  I need to pick up on that as opposed to just dicking around while I am waiting  ,F30
What do you think is the problem  Why aren't you passing ,F30
That's awesome    Keep it up    ,F30
Many people only know how to play vid games and watch you tube  It takes effort to get a new hobby passion  No passion is dull ,F30
I believe that i actually have the motivation to study  but my parents are constantly behind me nagging to study and I seriously cant focus on studying if they are nagging me 24 7  it puts me off    ,F30
Nah  it's been 5 years and I'm only getting older  ,F30
Thank you  And I agree  I'll try to get of shape  I also think that'd help loads  Thank you ,F30
Maybe it's certain people that triggers it  ,F30
It's the small victories  That's what kept me going ,F30
Please know that we are all here for you  Life is hard for everyone in their own way  believe me  Money doesn't solve problems  I am here to talk if you need or want to  ,F30
Haven't had it myself but I'm really happy for you  it is a sign of things getting better  Thanks for sharing it's always nice to see that people's situations can improve,F30
Same  would have been absolute worse year had it not been the year I picked up the fiddle ,F30
I can't study when I'm home I need to completely change environment  Why don't you do your study in a local library  That way you improve your focus and avoid your parents altogether  ,F30
Are you still with us  Oh my god  edit  please be able to read this  edit  as in everything probably still sucks but hopefully you're alive and will read this ,F30
My parents sadly dont let me go out to study as they believe that home is the best conducive environment  ,F30
If your rationale is strong then I can be disproved  Maybe you just need a different environment  Have you thought about trying something new this year  ,F30
OkCupid  Tinder  Match  and every site in between for the past 6 years  Nothing works ,F30
Since the beginning of 2016 my life has been a downward spiral  I see no end to this in 2017 also,F30
Update  Got plastered for NYE  Managed to keep myself happy with close friends around and some other substance abuse ,F30
Don't be sorry it's not a waste of time if it helps you vent  Why do you think you're boarding  ,F30
If only we hadn't been born without the natural gift of charisma they take for granted so easily   ,F30
That makes sense     for now i do everything in 1 room  ill try what you say  thanks for your concerns  ,F30
That means so much my whole life no one has said nicer things I'm going to hold off on suicide for now and just try and focus on work thanks a lot for the kind message  ,F30
I Play league of Legends but i am new  D,F30
Or you'll give zero fucks about repeating something you know the outcome to ,F30
Glad to hear it   Again  don't hesitate to message me if you need to  ,F30
Congratulations guys  If you're reading this  it means you survived 2016  Let's try surviving 2017  Even if 2016 sucked and 2017 will suck harder for sure   ,F30
I know this feeling all to well and it's terrible  If you ever need someone to talk to just message me  ,F30
Feel like shit  get angry and fall asleep  then regret all of it when I wake up,F30
Same  not a single text  I thought I'd get one because I was texting a friend a lot close to midnight  but mid conversation she dropped me  No clue why  ,F30
I'm a straight white male and I still want to kill myself  I'm also lonely as fuck    The grass isn't much greener on the other side,F30
I'm always sorry for talking about this   I'm sorry about the fact that people have to deal with me   Because there is nothing interesting about me  ,F30
Are you transgendered  If so  I'm sorry for what you're going through  It's tough about there  especially for trans women  ,F30
 black out  lol  nah but seriously man  sex isn't everything  but as a fellow lonely person i feel your pain  if you wanna talk i'm here,F30
Thanks for replying   But I'm not going for the job  My father don't allowed me to go  I guess I just have to keep going the rough path       Happy new year to you  ,F30
It just sucks  I have no idea if I've done anything wrong and everyone just kinda left me in the dust  I really cannot wait to graduate cause I'm trying to look forward and hoping college is much better,F30
"I've noticed that I've been ""looking"" for depression in other people  If I weren't depressed I probably wouldn't be  but aside from that depression has become a meme lately and it desensitizes the issue I think ",F30
What is your next goal ,F30
Don't do it  honestly if you're rock bottom it can only get better  There is help for you to get ,F30
Im sorry for your lose if you ever need to talk im here ,F30
Thank you for sharing  what about the personal essay was really hard to do ,F30
don't do it  get more selfish ,F30
so hard to talk to parents when I feel like shit,F30
i read the fish oil book by dr  stoll re omega 3's  and the rhodiola book by dr  gerbarg and brown   changed everything ,F30
It takes a very long time to learn about ourselves  what you're feeling is normal  Yes  in time    good luck,F30
I don't know what I am  I just know that even surgery wouldn't give me what I want  But thanks for your words ,F30
Aha good  Well if in doubt I'm on Reddit   ,F30
Your family and friends support you  try to ask them for help  and show them you're depressed if they don't know you are ,F30
Life sucks  dude   I'm sorry about her  Hopefully one day we'll find someone to fill this huge never ending void they left in our hearts,F30
Exactly my thoughts   I'm dreading it so much I've come up with a plan to avoid it and the years to come ,F30
Writing has always made me anxious tbh  I don't know why it's so hard for me to get started  Also because I'm not sure why I picked that program or major and how to get it into words ,F30
Well that's something   cats are nice  Although I usually hear dogs are better at improving moods haha  ,F30
I would be  because blood levels can go up and down by quite a lot  and lithium can do a lot of damage to your body  But you need to make your own risk assessment  ,F30
i am a straight white dude and i am lonely     i hope things get better for you OP  ,F30
Thanks  I really appreciate the kind words   If I may ask  though  how long did it take for the world to become kinder   I'm in my second year of college and it's just as bad as high school ,F30
Did your family also get damaged by the communist system  Also is it south east Europe ,F30
My boyfriend knows everything about how I feel and am  and he chooses to be with me and love me regardless  I've also talked to therapist before  a couple different ones actually  but nothing ever came of it  It's more awkward than anything  ,F30
So is it late too get into the school ,F30
I drink like a fish  ,F30
I missed the application deadline  I'm planning to taking a gap year and reapply for 2018  Just not sure what to do for the next year ,F30
Absolutely  I do this as well  It's like I become a masochist when depressed  and I don't want to do anything because that's how it should be when I'm depressed  Void and vacant ,F30
Ah ok at least you have some time to think about it  Good luck dude  also try not ignoring your mum  it probably hurts her feelings   ,F30
Yo dude PM'd you if you wanna talk I understand everything you're saying and experiencing ,F30
Keep it up and stay strong   I think it's an easy way for us to punish ourselves   neglecting ourselves physically    You're valuing yourself and that's amazing  ,F30
Still  it is discouraging that 60  of my work will probably be towards hitting the level that some privileged people got a head start on top of,F30
Getting on my bike before noon for the first time in a long time today  HNY EOODs ,F30
You're not alone  We're right there with you,F30
Yay that's great  I really need to start brushing my hair every day  It's basically just a ball of knots on top of my head ,F30
Umm I wish I could say yes  but being social really just feels unnatural  Kinda like I'm pretending to be something I'm not  So I just accept that I'm a loner  I still have friends just not that many ,F30
The ol'  good shadowing ,F30
   thanks man  Thanks for reading  always helps to be listened to  I like your username too btw ,F30
A better attitude is to be thankful to them instead of sorry for you  What do you do to entertain yourself  ,F30
Wow I relate to this so much ,F30
I don't wanna look like Agent 47   ,F30
if you're gonna kill yourself which you shouldn't  at least do it the normal ways  Don't ruin some random guys day by making him shoot you  what the hell man ,F30
I'm sorry bud  Loneliness sucks no matter who you are ,F30
I really appreciate this comment  I'm basically in the same boat as you  It's nice to hear that I'm not alone in how I feel ,F30
Feel you buddy  only 20 hours in to 2017 and shit's already happening  even though i'd rank 2016 as the worst year of my life i've a feeling this is gonna be worse   ,F30
that dogshit example was neat,F30
Same I don't want school,F30
About 22 and I'd I am just going to keep my head up and keep walking for now ,F30
Nice  what are you learning  ,F30
Try 21 years for me   I'm 33  ,F30
Totally don't care for the new year  I can't see much changing in my life and my current situation is unsustainable ,F30
I'm in the same boat  But it depends  how old are you  If you're in college or high school it's much easier than afterwards  ,F30
Same here  It's almost as though you feel like you have to prove that you're depressed  That if you don't have the telltale signs then its not valid  so you try to maintain those symptoms in a way,F30
Seriously what the fuck ,F30
Theres a positive and negative side to everything  neither of them are more true than the other,F30
We want the positive things but when we have them we are not grateful  It's a circle  I'm not even sure to know what I want  ,F30
Not the worst but bad,F30
Lmao I got no idea either ,F30
If it makes you feel better I didn't either  just watched movies and played video games til 11 59 then watched the ball dropped and then proceeded to continue my stuff,F30
Yeah thanks man  Been getting some help over the past few months and it's been meh   ,F30
Oh wow I didn't know that thank you for the heads up  Will be careful when recommending that in the future ,F30
I love the aggression man  You don't need a girl  you want a girl  You don't have to do anything,F30
I am dark skinned asian  Basically among the most unsought after and undesired group for relationships regardless of anything like orientation  Anything else has a better chance than what I am   ,F30
What's there to celebrate  same day as anything else,F30
Edit  If you want a fun read about threatened male sexuality you may look through  these comments   https   www reddit com r pics comments 5l9w24 not sure where to post my cousins job just asked dbu11b6  ,F30
Agreed 100   All it is is a change in numbers honestly ,F30
I just finished reading Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari and it goes in to this a little bit,F30
"""look at dogshit from a different angle""  is this correct ",F30
I got lucky  a few family members  grandmother and sisters texted me happy new year ,F30
I do that too  I like it because if I get toothpaste all over the place or all over  me  I can just wash it away  ,F30
Don't give up just yet  Keep trying  there is a solution to your problems ,F30
Yessir break it apart find the biology and chemistry in it and understand it just like when the proctilogist does the colonoscopy without giggling  Same with depression learn some psychology and understand whats really going on  ,F30
this is why I smoke meth  Well kinda ,F30
What do you aim to do to occupy your time ,F30
Thank you for sharing  soundslike a great routine  ,F30
That's cool  I work image and video processing and optimization  what are the topics that you mostly handle  I've wanted to learn WebGL  but I was deep in the hole ,F30
It feels like you're just floating through life  It's a terrible feeling ,F30
They are equally killer   But you're right  Not having to pretend    I'll take that ,F30
But it has a 364 in 365 chance of not being worse   How hopeless that sounds ,F30
Fuck  I really wish I could help you    ,F30
When the clock hits twelve  life's still shitty ,F30
Thanks    ,F30
So by your logic bad things don't just happen we make them happen  I call B S ,F30
Gratz mate  Brushing your teeth is great  You feel so confident when you look into the mirror with those well kept teeth ,F30
What a shitty preachy post man  no offense  ,F30
Glad to hear it  I hope your year is filled with lots more laughs  chuckles  tickles  and giggles    ,F30
It's all good man  Sounds like you are still in high school  I am completely failing out of college  I have wasted thousands of dollars  ,F30
So do I   I remember when I was 17 and had the feeling I was invisible  Today I am 30  and nothing has changed  I am the same  just way more worn out ,F30
In the trashcan    Jk   I mean no offense ,F30
I wanna reroll character  Like 10 points into charisma or something ,F30
Same with me buddy  I've knocked booze on the head  otherwise I'd have died through it  I take my meds  an on the whole  they work   Hope you're ok,F30
Start out by brushing before going to bed ,F30
Proud of ya m8ty  Take that momentum and go onto the next   ,F30
"To OP  if you're trying to help  go fuck yourself  If anyone here wanted this kind of ""advice"" they would go to church  ",F30
Yeah  I echo the sentiment  Hugs to you all  ,F30
Yes  unfortunately  ,F30
Sorry there buddy  Not really sure how I can help since I'm in a similar situation  All I can do is hope for the best for you and that friends will come your way soon ,F30
Thank you for caring man  it's nice knowing there are still people willing to support others through hard times     Hope everything works out for us in the end ,F30
Your bubbles of optimism are just too cute for me to pop,F30
Oh yeah I know how it feels  like    it comes and goes away  I hope you'll stay strong next time it happens ,F30
Yo dude  speak to people it can really help a lot  I tried to kill myself 3 weeks ago and failed  it was a girl that pushed me over the edge  If you want to speak PM me  ,F30
You do it enough times you start to love how fresh your breath feels afterwards  And you begin to hate the feeling of morning breath  SO it's definitely worth keeping up  well done mate ,F30
All NMDA antagonists do  in low doses  They are simultaneously sedating and activating ,F30
Does the college have campuses  If yeah why not more there  If no  well      d you know,F30
We're all sad people now ,F30
Oh yeah  i feel you OP  Nothing can ever replace that kind of want for me  I want it so much  To feel loved and embraced  ,F30
Keep trying to find new distractions  When you are so occupied that you don't run out of them anymore  maybe you'll feel better,F30
Same  I crave friendships and relationships where I can share and learn and grow with those people  I have had it before and I know how enriching it is  But now I'm alone again and it is so difficult  ,F30
I feel the same  very anxious and alone  But I do not feel that I have the whole year for make or break  I probably have only this month for things at last to improve ,F30
Yeah  what do you like to do mate  I'd like to know as well  ,F30
I also think that there's no reason to celebrate but since people do it anyway  it's good to try to participate  For me  it isn't about a different number on the calendar  it is about enjoying the  few  good people in my life ,F30
i learned python now i am trying to learn c    i really want to build a website  ,F30
Time is an arbitrary concept  so are the numbers we attach to it  It's difficult to get around that ,F30
i am into web design but i really want to get into making video games ,F30
I couldn't either  last time I drank I went to a dark  dark place and hurt my hand    ,F30
The next hour more like ,F30
Me either  Usually on holidays I end up texting a few people I know and wishing them well and they will respond  But I didn't even bother last night  No messages when I woke up either   ,F30
No dorms  I could rent an apartment or something nearby  but I don't really have money to spend right now ,F30
Okay  How are you coping ,F30
I know how it is  We should just take a day at a time  I know for aure I can't have a year like last year again   way too much ,F30
I like your insight  ,F30
I dont mean to dismiss you  but I cant even get  one   assignment done  So should I make smaller goals  or take a different approach ,F30
You should watch Chill with Bob Ross    that's what I'm doing right now  it's so calming ,F30
I fucked up already  I hurt someone I care about and have no idea how to fix it  I'm jumping between feeling like a god wanting to step in the river and wanting to fuck anything that moves,F30
   it really isn't meant to be if you've been trying for a year  If she doesn't want to talk to you then it would be best to honour that if you really did love her ,F30
This is awesome    Proud of you OP,F30
Things won't magically be better because yesterday was 2016 and today is 2017  That's not how things work   To get better  you have to actually  do  something constructive for yourself  ,F30
   thanks bud you too,F30
I feel exactly this  this exact feeling is why I'm on this subreddit right now  ,F30
Any advise for someone who just graduated  I don't have clubs to join,F30
Depends  In most multiplayer games it  competitive especially  leads to frustration and annoyance  But some of my fondest gaming memories come from communicating as well  When Firefall had thumping at high levels  with everyone working together and communicating  it was fantastic  ,F30
At times life is good  at times it feels like worth of giving up  Fixing those issues is like moving a mountain just to get to the starting point where other people start their journey ,F30
Hey   U ok  ,F30
I wrote about it  here  https   www reddit com r SuicideWatch comments 5i99lj 31 december 2016 ship canal bridge figured most db7k7yk  context 3  ,F30
Same  it doesn't help that someone I literally just made friends with not too long ago cut ties with me without warning or telling me why  I feel so alone ,F30
Okay  I understand  Do you have a support system for when times get tough ,F30
i didn't get into APIs that's a bit of an advanced topic for an armature   like me      if you've been able to learn c   then java won't be any problem  ,F30
 awesome  I always wanted to learn to code but I think it would be too much for my brain haha  Dont have the time either,F30
Yea  saw some fireworks walked home and cried three hours straight without being able to stop  For the last three and a half years that has been my holiday routine  I hate my life ,F30
Thanks man  likewise  ,F30
it will b difficult for me yes    worse i dont know   i m going to take steps to get myself out of this mess  Fuck the world ,F30
Yesterday I saw some fireworks walked home and cried three hours straight without being able to stop and for the last three and a half years that has been my routine for new years  It is really starting to be unbearable ,F30
That's what i've been telling everyone how i feel  I say I'm just an observer my whole entire life  Trying to fit in a world that i'm not compatible with  ,F30
I've been crying to myself for at least 2 hours  i just feel like shit  ,F30
jesus christ literally me this morning ,F30
So I guess the stories of being a wizard when you hit 30 as a virgin weren't real      ,F30
 u crowbird  it's not that hard you gotta start small   start with a simple to use and easy to learn programming language like python or visual basic hope this helped     ,F30
I feel the same way ,F30
2017 will be the year i do something  Either die or live  not more of this living hell   ,F30
Perhaps you could treat it as an escape button in case things go bad  Do something crazy like go swimming in a public pool ,F30
I don't have anyone to celebrate with,F30
The moment I tried to be more outgoing and try to make new friends is the moment my college career was taken away from me  I'm tired of trying  ,F30

I just got one Happy New Year text  My mom     Happy New Year OP  ,F30
Ironically the people who put down using the computer are the ones who spend most of their time socializing on their smartphones which are basically small computers ,F30
Hey  thanks for your reply  Much appreciated  One followup question  any particularly noteworthy adverse effects when you started taking LDN   Low dose naltrexone is something I've learned about only recently  ,F30
   there's hope for us afterall   ,F30
I'm planning on not surviving ,F30
Cutting your arm is safest for me to avoid making a mistake,F30
How long has it been since you both broke up  Would you setback together with him ,F30
Someone whos not mortally bothered by their laziness ,F30
My PC kept me alive I don't know what to do with out it,F30
Idk I think Filipinos can be pretty cute  Personally I think dark skinned asians tend to be cuter than light skinned asians ,F30
It's an distraction  Might be beneficial  I can talk to others   May be harmful  because it only covers up and postpones my problems ,F30
Yes  It can  I've experienced it before  I literally went years without really touching someone  ,F30
Dear  u rob cornelius  thank you so much for all your kind words to everyone and your support of this sub  You're a good friend to people here ,F30

I have moments like this but then feel like a hypocrite since I havent sent any either  I think about everyone but i doubt they want to get a message from me so i dont  Its fine though ,F30
End of January at the soonest ,F30
New year same shit to be honest  I have had a bad few days and it's most certainly not getting better  So just know you're not alone ,F30
The number is different but the shit is the same,F30
I don't want you to feel like you're not entitled to calling yourself depressed because you do in fact deserve to call your state of mind however you want  after all it's your mind  Depressed is just another label which I don't like  ,F30
I can't comment on how my age has affecting anything  because I was just diagnosed   but I've had fairly a positive experience with Latuda  if that's what you're thinking of trying next  ,F30
Doing okay  Christmas was a struggle  ,F30
Ya  you become the witness of everything  Depressed people think a lot  it's one of the reasons why we suffer  Other people don't stop to analyze things  they are fine with whatever is in life for them and lucky for their happy genes ,F30
And did it get better after you found someone  ,F30
I haven't had plans with people not in my family on new years in ages  It sucks and I understand why you hate it  I literally just laid in my bed and just scrolled through reddit ,F30
Yeah I'm on the same boat  I've had a really bad few weeks and 2017 won't change anything lol ,F30
I never have  There doesn't seem to be a point to it  just another shitty year  ,F30
Hah well so long as the cat helps it's good 3 what's up ,F30
Haven't had New Years plans in years  I understand your pain  It sucks and you're not alone ,F30
If you live in the UK depression is classified as a disability if you have it for over 9 months  Not sure about elsewhere,F30
Oh  I sure hope it gets better ,F30
Same here  It's harder for me since I'm a college dropout and my job doesn't have any good environment,F30
I feel the same way ,F30
Its just that we dont know how to love  so it just ends up hurting us,F30
What are his symptoms ,F30
Hapiness normally comes with small acts or activities that makes you feel alive inside  I'm glad you shared your experience and I hope 2017 will bring you more of these  D,F30
i honestly feel the same,F30
I'll take a look at that later   What do you think about a session of gaming with me  I'm depressed too and need a good match to relax    ,F30
I haven't got help been suffering for few years I want to get help too because I'm just getting worse and worse too it's not just going to go away,F30
So true  I get so much more work done when I'm at the library  I think knowing that I would have wasted time if I left without getting work done is what keeps me on track ,F30
I don't even have the first part anymore ,F30
Couldn't of said it better than that ,F30
Why the fuck is everyone on my instagram feed partying celebrating  I don't get it ,F30
Better than Heroin i suppose ,F30
They're trying to distract themselves from the fact that they and everyone they know are completely insignificant ,F30
You're still a person  You're going through a hell of a tough time but you can get through it  You don't need to remember how to act as a human  as you get better you'll do it intrinsically ,F30
hey man  i hope you change your plans on that  im rooting for you,F30
Do you get some dots in your mouth that hurt like hell after a few days of brushing ,F30
Sounds nice  What are you playing ,F30
Of course  that's the best way to keep forward   ,F30
"I really like that classic image with the dolphin  ""i wanna die""   Puts a smile on my face ",F30
Since you feel like you no reason to love yourself you can't grasp the idea of someone loving you ,F30
Hoping for the best for you ,F30
I made it about a year off meds before shit got real and I crashed REALLY REALLY hard and ended up back in the hospital  Good luck ,F30
Eh if you wanna talk to someone pm me  I ain't doing much and I'm a very tolerant person  If we have some similar interests we can chill and talk about that  Up to you I don't mind just doing muh thing over here ,F30
Thou hast journey'd far  and overcome much  chosen Undead  Come hither  child    Stop lying to yourself  I'm sure you're not unwanted,F30
i live in the US  it's considered a disability but if you can't show up to a job they don't really care why ,F30
That sucks  Is your boss the understanding type ,F30
Racism exists  Homophobia exists  So  Both of those things I have to experience first hand and experience all the issues from that  Being a straight white man you have better chances than me though   Thank you for the reply though  ,F30
Exactly what i was thinking  You think it's gone for a few days and it comes back to hit even harder ,F30
This made me want to replay the first Dark Souls    ,F30
You'd have to do what I do everyday for that to happen,F30
I can't give you any tips since I'm in the same boat but I wish you good luck   ,F30
You're not alone  this feels terrible  When you're in debt and lost everything  We'll sort it out i'm sure ,F30
When I saw the title I thought oh we're our own race of Depressed people,F30
I don't even have the energy I just feel mentally and emotionally trapped ,F30
Thanks for sharing  It's beautiful ,F30
I could care less if you have depression  Just don't be an asshole  I don't want to be in a relationship with an asshole guy  ,F30
i dunno man  take it easy   ,F30
His favorite spot is his bed  sleeping problems  irritability  social isolation  and has gained 40kg since he lost his last job 10 y o ,F30
It's just not worth it  ,F30
im proud of you buddy  its the little things that can mean a whole lot  keep it up    ,F30
I wish you good luck with it  Even if it is hard  there is nothing to loose     Let us know how your 2017 is going ,F30
Could one learn to be depressed just to justify their laziness   Subconsciously of course,F30
I lost all my friends this year  so no  I don't celebrate anything anymore ,F30
wot rings u got bithc Well unless you have a 100 gb hdd    you done goofed,F30
Hey  15 too  I'm here if you ever need to talk or vent ,F30
I don't even believe things will get better anymore,F30
If you're going to abandon her anyway there's no need to kill yourself to do that  Otherwise you should consider if you can raise the child or are willing to put it up for adoption  Otherwise an abortion might be your only option ,F30
Yep and this further proves my point that people only use you then cast you aside when you need help,F30
I spent the entire evening worried about how we're gonna afford groceries after paying rent and bills  I didn't share this with her so I was just this solemn melancholy ass all night    ,F30
This is exactly what I said last year    and   the year before  on New Years Eve  Nothing is going to change  ,F30
Think of it like this  I hate myself when I do just anythung  The only thing I know how to do is absolutely nothing ,F30
When I wanted to hang myself because I didn't see the point in life  Still don't see a point ,F30
When i get her back im going to PM you  Im not giving up  She's my girl  ,F30
Whoever you are  I believe in you  You can make it through this because you're awesome   ,F30
i feel lonely thing is i have friends  its a weird feeling  ,F30
I believe in you  You can pull through this  Take as much time as you need for recovery     You're amazing ,F30
An endless neverending fucked up cycle of despair,F30
Im actually on Latuda currently and it is causing me some problems ,F30
Thanks  I hope I can  ,F30
I have some friends and a brother  I feel that relationships tend to always complicate things and create more problems than they solve ,F30
Because it's fun  and fun is what we all want  It's just that everyone's definition of fun isn't the same ,F30
Thank you for letting me know    Glad to hear im not the only one having trouble with Latuda,F30
Thank you so much for your reply ,F30
Yeah I'm asking that   could the fact that you hate yourself just a way to defend yourself against accusations of laziness ,F30
Nothing is fun to me    I don't see anything as fun,F30
New year or not it's always the same shit  ,F30
Yes    Almost if not all mood stabilizers can cause drowsy groggy zombie effects,F30
what about lamictal   agmantine instead  ,F30
 Very relevant comic  http   www depressioncomix com posts 191  ,F30
Just remember that you're not alone in the world and you can do it ,F30
Is it better to take it in the evening  ,F30
Thanks means a lot  ,F30
Just do something for yourself then  Eat something you like  watch a movie or something  Make the date be just an excuse for you to do something nice ,F30
Honestly i don't think this is the kind of guy you want to associate with anyway  Best thing you can do in the new year is try to move on,F30
If you ever need someone to vent to  you can PM me  Good luck with everything   ,F30
Pretty sure that's exclusive to physically disabled people and is difficult to do regardless  Don't kill yourself dude,F30
Thanks for the feedback ,F30
thank you for answering   Everything is going out of control  And my life is the only thing I'm still able to have in my hand  Getting out is gonna be my best bet to fix everything ,F30
Of course  And seriously  don't hesitate to ask any questions ,F30
Nonsense  Who says you're repulsive  And more then that  there are many who wouldn't care   ,F30
Dropping out isn't the same as fixing anything  You're right that you have a choice here  Choose to live,F30
What kind of light thearpy ,F30
What kind of light thearpy  Do you have a wave length ,F30
Nah  there is nothing that can be done but yeah it sucks  I hope you manage  since I really can't help you   ,F30
I should also specify  it's usually NYE New Years  As in  around midnight  That's when my anxiety attacks start to lose their shit ,F30
I don't know dude ,F30
" I don't like eating anymore    and eating is expensive  I don't need an excuse to do anything  it would be meaningless of I fabricated some reason to do something ""enjoyable celebratory""     I don't need fun in my life",F30
I just read through a couple dozen of these and I can completely relate to 95  of these  Some I feel I could have written myself  i e  They used the exact same words going around in my head  ,F30
I went to bed at 1015 pm and it felt wonderful to wake up at a normal hour  fully rested and no hangover  I'd take that over most other ways last night could have gone ,F30
Video games and a lot of it ,F30
You're definitely not alone  Latuda made me vomit almost every night   P   Edit  But lamictal probably saves my life every day  So good stuff is out there   P,F30
I hope I get my shit together finally in 2017  else I don't know what I am gonna do  I wish for all of you to come out of this shit too  this mental torture ,F30
Same here  I came on this site to hopefully find people who felt like I do in hopes that I wouldn't feel so alone  I'm always here to talk if you need someone ,F30
Wish I could help you  but you're posting your question in the most wrong subreddit on here ,F30
"I usually ""celebrate"" by watching Syfy's Twilight Zone marathon  It's been an on and off tradition for many years now  Still felt like shit and went to bed early though ",F30
I couldn't sleep at all last night thinking like that  I feel ya bro  ,F30
I'm trying to stick to recovery of an ED  along with bipolar depression  and freaking fibromyalgia  I'm going to my pdoc Tuesday morning  and telling him that shit has hit the fan  broken it  and the blades are flying into pieces ,F30
Sometimes I am able to help myself  other times it feels overwhelming  but somehow I need to get there  Thank you for your words  I wish you luck and hope you can get what you need and where you need to be too,F30
I take my Lamictal in the evening   my doctor advised me to do so to avoid any tiredness side effects     ,F30
Hi     Come talk  i don't want you to go  ,F30
Same for me today  too   ,F30
I feel the same  I try to focus my mind on things like roleplaying and such  Still it's very hard  but humans are superb on surviving ,F30
Yeah  that's depression       http   www psnpaloalto com wp wp content uploads 2010 12 Depression Diagnostic Criteria and Severity Rating pdf,F30
I work with my depression  I've always been pretty functional  Do you take medications or see a therapist  I did have a while where I had crying spells at work and they adjusted my medications and it helped  ,F30
Those are a lot of the things I've struggled with  so yeah I do get what you're feeling  Your university's doctors should be a big help  I know mine are,F30
Sadly you're a couple of hours away so i can't give you a hug we can talk if you like,F30
Big step  Way to go  Glad your parents are behind you  Good luck at the doctor's ,F30
Hey  just thought you should know that I did the same on my Facebook about 15 mins ago  Already got a fair few likes     Haha  Feels good to have finally done it  Thanks for the advice and Happy New Year  ,F30
Good to know  thanks so much  ,F30
Lol 12 15 I logged in here  P,F30
How old are you    ,F30
Wow that's a very helpful sheet  thank you  I've studied the DSM V but never seen the criteria broken down like that  Thanks again ,F30
Sameeeee  similar to u firefades I'm not quite there geographically  I'm down in ol Landan town  so can't oblige in person    Sending a massive one virtually though  hope you're okay   ,F30
That's good to know  thanks  I'm not a fan of opening up and talking to people  but hearing that it's helped makes it seem a little better  Hope you're feeling well  ,F30
Thank you for the sentiment  It's not much but it does help ,F30
If it's a burden to play then you can always put it down for later,F30
I am so happy for you you are on the path to find your happiness ,F30
"""comparison is the thief of joy"" I have heard of somewhere on reddit   ",F30
I know what you mean  I feel like saying you like to watch movies may sound more socially acceptable  eye roll  to people  Would that work ,F30
Agmatine doesn't have much human research for psychiatric purposes  Since it inhibits NMDA receptors without inhibiting AMPA receptors it would probably be synergistic  but it's hard to say ,F30
please feel free to pm me if you need to vent ,F30
 r INeedToTalkToSomeone   r KindVoice ,F30
Join a club  sports  fitness  a certain hobby  whatever you like  Find a place with people like you and make friends with them  That's what i'm doing atm and it's working pretty good,F30
Dude keep going and go to the doctor to make sure you don't have spinal problem ,F30
I can relate dude  I threw a project X party on New Years Eve 3 years ago and my friend took all the credit  Join a club of your interest  What are your passions or hobbies,F30
Okay thank you  I'm going to start taking it at night now  I'm surprised my doctor didn't warn me  ,F30
Every time I get close to a point where I think I'm happy it's taken away  Like some kind of sick cosmic joke,F30
This is so true  Incredible  seeing this exact description of where I'm at at the moment  gave me some feeling of confidence  I guess  Wow ,F30
Thanks appreciate it and will probably will need to at somepoint same goes to you if you ever need to aswell   ,F30
Change yourself  just to be better   I am human and so are you  We are supposed to have flaws issues  We need to upgrade ourselves  Never ever be an outdated app ,F30
Well done  and don't forget about your gums too  Give them a healthy light 'brushing' as well    Good job  ,F30
Are you sure  What do you spend most of your time doing that you want to do  I personally find video games and using the internet fun  It's what keeps me going ,F30
Hey  good to see isn't it  actually being able put it into words  I've been in a dark place and one of old friend sent me that  I was in amazement when I read it  It does give you confidence stay strong friend ,F30
"I felt like I don't deserve being happy    And that ""happy me"" was responsible for all this mess and so blind that he couldn't see it  Anything was preferable to that ",F30
  I am more physically oriented  but totally   Mmm    In short  it's good because someone is on your side   ,F30
Do you take any anxiety medications by chance  ,F30
It's totally normal to feel fine for years  But unfortunately when symptoms come back they can come on suddenly ,F30
Please don't end your life  You aren't worthless  You may be going through a rough patch at the moment  but you can make it through this  You're an amazing person and I believe in you    ,F30
thanks ill try that sub ,F30
Such strange times this new year is bringing ,F30
Horrible to say but this is true   Really hope not for everyone ,F30
We'd make some time  I suppose  to learn ,F30
No work  no job lol ,F30
Yes   For me it's a part of bpd as well and nor has no much if an identity tbh,F30
thank you  actually asked my mom  but she ignored me and kept reading her book  oh well  I will talk to my girl though  you're right  thank you once more ,F30
I'm sure you could find something else to do,F30
no problem  i hope you can find the love and support you need  don't give up on yourself  you're worth it  if you ever need to talk  my pms are open  ,F30
Thank you for this  You said  in much more eloquent terms of course  exactly what I wanted to say to that OP  Hopefully he feels some relief after reading it ,F30

There is a lot of medicine and not every meds for every person  It takes time to find the right one because these meds hurts your organ if you go through alot too rapidly ,F30
That's what  u Pizzachu1 does best  mock the pain of everyone around him but whine when someone gives him a taste of his own medicine ,F30
That stripper sounds like a cunt  I don't blame you for your actions  but it's a shame the consequences will be severe  Best of luck to you  ,F30
Congratulations on taking this step  I'm sure you won't regret it and I hope it helps you be happier    ,F30
You don't know me  I get so close to pulling myself out of whatever the hell hole I'm in and something just knocks me back to the bottom  ,F30
I haven't seen it but I will check it out  it does look interesting  Thank you,F30
op you are amazing    I also saw your post replying to everyone and I think you need to listen to your own advice cause it's good and you have it in you     message anytime    ,F30
Bro 77kg at 1 80 isn't overweight  That sounds fairly normal to me  depending on your age  You're probably not nearly as fat and ugly as you think ,F30
You live your life for yourself  Don't plan it around someone else's but focus on your own life and find what it is that you want,F30
that sounds shitty bro  blast some music on and chillax  give urself a break for a day or two ,F30
I believe in you  I know it's rough that this keeps happening  But eventually  you're going to try and succeed and feel great about that  Stay strong ,F30
No  he is looking for people who have successfully gotten out from depression  But this sub is just a whole sub of sad people with very few people who give insightful response ,F30
bro i deleted FB 4yrs ago  never been back once,F30
Idk guess I was just looking for an easy fix  No such luck in this world I guess ah,F30
Okay  I understand  Are you able to talk with those people about what you're going through ,F30
It helped me alot and also reddit has replace Facebook in a positive way ,F30
OK  Why not  ,F30
i wish i had your courage  dealing with this since july 2016    alone,F30
They have been more or less dicks to me all my life  comparing how they treat others  But the last few months have been especially pain  This day was broke the camel's back ,F30
and how do you meet new people and make new friends  because facebook is the only way i can find out people,F30
Find some new hobbies or fun things to do  even if they're super simple  Maybe this will help you be happier    Stay strong  I believe in you ,F30
My sexual addiction is killing me  Its one fucking day into the new years and i have fucked two random people   Slut  ,F30
Currently job hunting  hoping having a job will help out  That job search depression is really kicking in though unfortunately  ,F30
Um   okay   ,F30
Hmm thanks for the tip   I started a couple shows and series but always got bored after a couple episodes   But I will give the shows you recommended a try should I find them online   ,F30
Feel you there  I was happy and with friends last night and thought maybe I would get a momentary break in the depression  but it came back with a vengeance this afternoon and i've been in a slump ever since  ,F30
Don't get too let down  job rejection happens to the best of us ,F30
Can you tell me why you want to die ,F30
In the same boat  but I only had 1 friend   and I lost him  Fuck ,F30
Feel free to Pm me if you just need someone to talk too   ,F30
How do you feel about explaining to her how you're feeling ,F30
Depression is not something you choose  All of our behavior can be traced to physical biological and environmental phenomena  You certainly didn't choose these things  Don't feel ashamed for the way you feel  That just makes the problem worse ,F30
Going through the same exact thing right now  I'm so sorry you're dealing with this too ,F30
That's an interesting take on it  I do remember being kind of excited to finally figure out who wins the afterlife debate  but I guess I have to wait a little longer,F30
This is a tough thing to go through  especially alone  do you have anybody supporting you ,F30
I wish I would just die  I hate myself  Nothing matters  I'm pathetic  And disgusting ,F30
How's your relationship with your family  Could you stay with them ,F30
Can you tell me what's making your run so hard  darling ,F30
I love the rhythm  Excellent work ,F30
It took a few months for Zoloft to work for me  Then I felt wonderful but now I feel like shit again     So I'm planning on talking to my psychiatrist about switching  ,F30
Honestly  I think it would help to be in a sunnier place   Not saying it would cure depression  but even just being able to spend more time outside would make me at least feel a bit better ,F30
Me too  Just please promise me to not make a plan  That's what I promise myself all the time  If I do make a plan  then I might as well consider myself dead then and there ,F30
Man I'm so glad I found them  thanks to you ,F30
"In so much that I appear fine and normal since the pills are ""fixing"" me  Otherwise it isn't spoken about  Thanks for asking ",F30
Stay strong friend and pray this all makes sense to us someday  I don't identify with any religion but I have to believe in a god or I couldn't cope  ,F30
I feel like this too  On the surface  my life looks great  Even my therapist says I'm making great progress but I don't agree and I feel like I'm stuck in a hole that I have no idea how to climb out of ,F30
Okay  how do you feel about that ,F30
That doesn't help OP ,F30
Tired  Numb  but Raw,F30
Okay  How do you feel about therapy ,F30
Not good  we rarely talk ,F30
Okay  How's your support system ,F30
Okay  I understand  Did therapy help you ,F30
"Most people here do speak to people and ask for help   Asking for and getting help do not ""cure""  anything though   ",F30
At first  but then  like all things  they lose their power or something ,F30
For video games as well  I used to love them  Now I use them as a distraction ,F30
Well mate I'm sorry for offending you but this is just the truth and my  our reality  Talking and affirmations doesn't fix this shit ,F30
This is exactly what I'm fearful of  I'm really poor right now and can't afford much  so if I'm going to turn out the way I came in   then no therapy for me ,F30
That's how I feel  that somehow real life is not for me  it's something that people around me do that I'm unable to  and that having no social life or goals like me is normal  ,F30
Because of things that happened when I was younger  Didn't tell them till a few years ago and no one believe me so we don't really talk anymore,F30
I have no plan  the expectation are too high for me  I just want to live my life  sometimes I just want to end it but I know if I did that someone that I know will never forgive me,F30
I have told one friend and can't afford a therapist   At least not yet ,F30
Anything else I should look for   Fine print stuff  company to use  etc  ,F30
"Bullshit you got butthurt because I didn't agree with you and go ""YEAHH THIS HELPED ME"" lurk more ",F30
Have you seen a dr  A hormonal imbalance  vitamin deficiency  family history can all cause depression without an obvious reason  ,F30
"Deleted mine in 2011 never used it much and never had many ""friends"" on it had it out of sheep mentality  you did the right thing ",F30
I honestly feel the exact same way  The med dosage I take helps with the pain and anxiety  but the loneliness and self loathing are ever present ,F30
Yep  I use them more of a crutch than enjoyment  I got new games for Christmas but I can't even motivate myself to play them  Sad   ,F30
Clickbait  Cute though  ,F30
I have learned this myself  Keep the suicide comments to a minimum so they don't take overt actions   It's about biding time  keeping every ball bouncing the same until things are in more control ,F30
gr8 b8 I r8 8 8 m8,F30
I agree with your logic,F30
shouldve deleted mine sooner aye    ,F30
yup memes are everywhere lmao  its only been a day since i deleted fb and it already feels like a huge weight was lifted of my shoulders  ,F30
No I haven't seen one  Im planning but I'm scared for my career   Im turning 25 in a few days and I haven't accomplished that much in my life  The career that I have right now is the only thing that I have by default,F30
i aint that desperate yet     lol,F30
Funnily enough  Kingdom Hearts was the game I was talking about lol  And I am currently on season 2 of the Flash  ,F30
I've been taking Zoloft for nearly 10 months   Haven't really noticed much other than I've grown more apathetic and 'lazy' than I have been in the past   ,F30
I'm so proud of you  good job  That's honestly such a hard thing to do  I hope you feel better soon ,F30
If I ever have to talk to a doctor teacher or friend I never say I'm depressed  I just say I want to die or I just hate living ,F30
All the time    ,F30
What are you interested in  ,F30
You're not required to love family    Perhaps you could use a new start  Maybe move away and develop new relationships  That's what I'm going to do  ,F30
It's actually one of the main causes of depression  one of the best things i've ever done in my life was to delete my Instagram account exactly a year ago  ,F30
Not much  I play the guitar a little bit but I suck at it  and I don't think that'll change soon ,F30
Sides i cant love friends eitehr all they ever do is cross me  ,F30
There is no sucking at guitar if you enjoy doing it  cheesy as that sounds ,F30
It's okay if you don't feel like it  no need to force yourself to do anything  But believe me  you need some fun in your life  It will not make any problem disappear  but it'll make them easier to bear ,F30
There really is tho  It's rough playing the same thing 300 times and realizing the one thing you actually care about is something you're so bad at  Something that you just can't train your fingers to do  How pathetic is that ,F30
Go places  Join clubs  Join a gym and attend fitness classes  Make friend with your colleagues  We both know there is no secret to making friends  You have to go places  ,F30
I deleted Facebook a while ago but was surprised to find out it's never actually permanently deleted  If you log in it will restart  How can you permanently delete it ,F30
I deleted Facebook a while ago but was surprised to find out it's never actually permanently deleted  If you log in it will restart  How can you permanently delete it ,F30
Well  I'm thinking of cutting my thighs again  opposed to killing myself  Nothing is really bothering me but my illness  also insomnia  Took a Trazadone and am waiting for that to work  Overall  I'm feeling empty ,F30
"""Dude  sucking at something is just the first step at being sorta good at somthing""   Jake The Dog  Adventure time  Season 1 episode   His Hero",F30
I haven't had any side effects with lamictal  but it's always a possibility,F30
that is a good point I think I am just desperate at this point that I am willing to do anything to engage in basic human interactions I do wanna be accepted by people but people usually don't want to associate with the real me ,F30
I hope you're in a better place   I'm struggling too right now and while it hurts to think of others sad lonely depressed it helps me to know I'm not alone  ,F30
Sorry to hear that   Are there any adults at school that you are comfortable talking to about some of this  ,F30
Make sure you get tested frequently  stay safe buddy    ,F30
Second this but without the friend zoned part  add fearing never meeting someone to connect to     ,F30
Sorry you don't feel like you have anyone to talk to   Feel free to message me if you would like someone to talk to  I would be happy to help   ,F30
I use my laptop and Xbox as an escape from it  My parents try to persuade me to take up more social activities but I'm just not the social type of person,F30
Why should we distract ourSelves  It's an escape not a cure like you said  It's fine if you want the temporary distraction but I don't ,F30
Even if I want to go somewhere I can't  I can't drive  and I'm stuck babysitting most days ,F30
I'm sorry  but I just don't get it  What exactly do you want  Are you satisfied with your current lifestyle  If so  why are you posting in  r depression  I might not have all the answers  but I want to help ,F30
If you really want to pursue improving yourself in guitar  the most you can do is practice and thinking about mistakes is good for learning but don't go overboard  I can't stress enough how important it is to be passionate about something though  ,F30
When someone tells you to knock off the pity party  I want you to smash that person in the face as hard as you can ,F30
Mine took about a month to work  first two weeks were hell and made me feel horrible  Just don't ever skip a dose  Zoloft withdrawals are the worst thing ever ,F30
It's so hard  Honestly I would say try to meet just one friend  from a club or something  The first friend is the hardest  After that  you can often hang out with that person's friends and it can have a trickle effect  ,F30
I deleted mine in 2015 and wanted to know who were my friends and acquaintances out of 250  people    The answer is None  ,F30
Wow I never even thought of New Years texts  I got a Facebook message from my mom and that's it  ,F30
Okay  Once you can afford it  how do you feel about trying it ,F30
It helps to know that you are not the only one,F30
yea that's true  for me a comparison would be like hugging family vs hugging a partner  light and day difference  but hugging family and friends still feels pretty good though ,F30
Yes  Facebook is a pox  Zuckerberg invented a brand new way for people to be offended  The dreaded Unfriending      The Horror       Fuck that whole clusterfuck of a social spiderweb ,F30
I agree  That's why I'm apart of the YMCA and lift shoot hoops almost daily  The problem is I can't just go random ass places by myself  That's how I end up on the news dead  ,F30
Check out these subs  r TwinCitiesTransplants r TwinCitiesSocial ,F30
You should ask your doctor whether they would like to consider switching to other medications in the same class as abilify aripiprazole    a common one used to augment wellbutrin in depression would be seroquel quetiapine ,F30
I wish I got cancer but of course I kept this opinion to myself because cancer is a sensitive issue to many people  ,F30
I feel the same ,F30
Same thing happened to me today as well  Hit me like a ton of bricks  ,F30
I miss not being depressed     I wish to be happy in 2017 and cure my depression ,F30
I'm sorry to hear that  message me if you'd like to talk    Hope things get better for you  ,F30
Ive had mine gone for a year and it feels relieving doesnt it  I like being on the low instead of on social media  Like all hidden  Facebook is for mindless people that sit around and judge those who don't live like them lol ,F30
23 y o  male here  kill me plz ,F30
Every time I read articles of terminally ill patients receiving assisted suicide  I can't help but feel jealous  ,F30
Not the guy you asked  but I find  r wholesomememes and  r absolutelynotme irl to be pretty interchangeable  so it doesn't bother me  Probably worth mentioning I don't really read the comments though ,F30
Can't think of one that I feel comfortable with  so really I just have to deal with it really ,F30
I feel so alone  And worthless  My life is falling apart and I'm losing the love of my life   I don't know if I can keep going,F30
     hugs      ,F30
Thank you so much  That is so helpful  Would you recommend consultation with a maternal fetal medicine specialist before becoming pregnant  ,F30
That means so much  way to go  The struggle with depression and hygiene is very real,F30
floating  waiting to leave ,F30
I'm sorry  Feel free to message me if you'd like to talk  ,F30
Mine did a preliminary diagnosis after the first session and then always updated it  I dont know if every psychiatrist is like this  or if they have to allow it  but I could always see it when I wanted ,F30
Not helpful for me  But everyone is different  ,F30
Nothing much is on my mind right now  just extremely worried about my future  I'm feeling quite upbeat for a change  not sure why  better make the most of it  How about you OP  ,F30
Have you checked this support group   http   www dbsalliance org site PageServer pagename peer support group locator,F30
Do you know for sure  ,F30
she just gave you a lame nonsensical excuse   try not to dwell too hard on that loser ,F30
just start banging lots of women bare back  eventually it will work out  Might not happen before all that pleasure changes your outlook  but don't get anyone prego  that would fuck up a 2nd life ,F30
Every fucking day  I know that suicide will hurt my mother and sister  so I hope that I wake up with heart disease or an aggressive cancer  Unfortunately  I am too healthy and stuck living a life I never wanted  ,F30
Wow it seems like the world's really piled it on  I'm sorry  That's really shitty  and I hope that you're able to have a day or two to regroup and be able to take the new year on  ,F30
no because I can easily off myself at any time by getting some drugs in Mexico and technically  if I do have depression  then that took my life   not me ,F30
This sub is completely useless for helping depressed people  ,F30
Well fuck me up a wall  I managed a full half hour  only 7 5 mins below that level 4 in total and even managed Level 5    Feels nice when you're not even sure you're going to make it 10 minutes ,F30
Yeah  i already go to a counselor in my own time      ,F30
Very proud of you  Thank you for bringing this up  I thought I was alone in this and so many people are posting similar things  Happy New Year ,F30
same  sometimes I say I'm just tired  it's almost like a taboo to mention the word  ,F30
yeah i already go to a counselor in my own personal time and thank you for the support  my parents aren't physically abusive at all but they do definitely not help with the things they say to me   ,F30
I been feeling like that too  Just tired of living,F30
I'm the same way except I'm contemplating suicide so that I don't have to be around for the deaths   I honestly dread one day hearing   your mother is dead   I don't want to hear that ,F30
Not too great but I have enough experience with depression now to work through it  even a little bit  ,F30
Well it's a new year and all i know is that i find comfort in computers  producing music  and cutting myself  Nobody around me understands shit thats going on with me and i don't care to explain to them either ,F30
Maybe sometimes we don't want to hear the truth  We want to hear something which says you'll do great  It'll all workout  No big deal  It's tough for you but it'll be okay cuz you are not the only one ,F30
Hugs with SO are the best thing   ,F30
really  they haven't harmed me physically in any way besides once and i always hear about more abusive family's compared to mine ,F30
Sadly I don't think people view it that way ,F30
i do currently go to a councilor in my own time and i dont really have anybody to talk to at school   thank you for the support,F30
im sorry that you are going through that too    ,F30
I already had a panic attack and crying session  Wow great year so far ,F30
thank you  you too    ,F30
NO  I dont think you are at all  forcing you to see someone who youve already hhad a bad experence with is stupid,F30
I already had a mental breakdown and I think I inflicted some damage to myself during a verbal batter with my S o  ,F30
im so sorry to hear that you are in the same situation as me       ,F30
i don't know for sure   but she said she was going to ,F30
"So now whats your next goal  ""Its the little things that matter """,F30
i already try to avoid them as much as possible  thank you for the support,F30
Are you in the USA  If so  check out your local Community Service Board  CSB   They have sliding scales for services  If you google it for your state you should get a list  Good luck,F30
Well as scary as it is  you need to find out  Call her  go to her  just be supportive of her  make her know she loved  ,F30
Thank you  But I've been apart of them for 6 months  For example that one subreddit hasn't been active for 2 weeks  Like Jesus Christ  This is suppose to be one of the largest cities in America and I can't find anything  Wtf,F30
no i live in Australia  the earliest you can work is 14 here  thank you for the concern though  ,F30
yes i watched their summer marathon too   ,F30
Nobody ever needs to be alone  I am sure there are adults that care but it is OK if you have not found someone you trust yet     What things do you enjoy doing outside of school  ,F30
The friend that insists you don't have Bipolar  where did they get their PhD   I'm just curious ,F30
I didn't understand what i was supposed to be celebrating  Was i supposed to be happy i made it to another year  eh  Fun for everyone else maybe ,F30
apparently the cops won't care about what they are doing  according to them ,F30
i already go to a counselor in my own time out side of school    thank you for your concern though,F30
Heard that  I skipped around schools so I never had a good couple of years or so to make friends  and my job kind of sucks  not a lot of friend material  It just gets harder as you get older ,F30
im sorry to hear that     ,F30
there are no words    i'm so sorry as best you can  surround yourself with kind people and try to just keep putting one foot in front of the other,F30
hmm i know    sadly we cannot choose who our parents family are  and i know a lot more people have it worse then me too   ,F30
Watching for suggestions  Same problem  ,F30
Same  I'm trying to figure out ways to improve myself and figure out a way to get out of this hell hole  ,F30
thank you for your support,F30
I enjoy playing video games  but now it's getting to the point where I'm showing a lack of interest towards games  I enjoy basketball  even though I'm not good at it  but recently moved and there's no basketballs courts around where I live ,F30
thank you for your support,F30
i currently live in Australia and no  but i do talk to a Counselor in my own time outside of school,F30
I just want to be better  It's hard imaging the future  but I want the future I think  I want friends and happiness and laughter and love   ,F30
Okay  I understand  How come you'd wait ,F30
What things  if you don't mind me asking ,F30
You cannot  You will have to activate your account to use messenger ,F30
Okay  Do you feel as if that'll be different with a different therapist ,F30
I feel worse because I know nobody will ever actually say these things to me ,F30
Definitely because the hug can become intimate with roaming hands haha  Hugs with SO can be affectionate and sexual making them more emotional and intimate fulfilling multiple needs at once  while hugs with everyone else is limited to just affection ,F30
There's no easy way to make depression just disappear  drugs may just help you manage it but likely won't cure you,F30
Yeah I know anti Natalism  I majored in philosophy and my old roommate did too  We talk about all sorts of stuff like this  Though I do appreciate the recommendation  I'll probably lurk around an anti Natalism sub later ,F30
Agreed  I'm not encouraging suicide by any means  but don't traumatize another human being in carrying it out  if that is the decision you've made  There are cleaner ways  ,F30
I'm crying right now ,F30
Not weed  but I tried MDMA once and it was like I remembered what being happy felt like  Haven't done it since but I've been happier overall since then  Weed helps with my anxiety tho,F30
'What a beautiful name'   I don't even really identify with my name,F30
Not okay  but alive  I appreciate you asking ,F30
thank you for the support,F30
sorry to hear that    ,F30
thank you for the support,F30
"I thought about that question often and come up with different answers each time  So I don't know  The other question is  ""Do I even want to try "" At this point  no ",F30
thanks for the support    ,F30
im so sorry you had to go through that  my parents are the same when it comes to convincing everyone that nothings wrong,F30
Sometimes I get really sad  but I'm thankful to have a friend like  u snapundersteer that understands me  It's been rough  but he's always been there for me,F30
Following this for future advice  I would just love to know more about being pregnant new mom while having bipolar for the someday that my husband and I are ready  I have a huge fear of PPD or worse psychosis ,F30
Sometimes it helps to tell people and realize that they love you anyway  There are so few people that I have been able to tell  Many of my friends know I am BP1  but very few people know what that actually means ,F30
That's good to know that you have found coping mechanisms that work ,F30
My school had a BP therapy group   check with counseling psychological services  You might also have a local NAMI or DBSA chapter ,F30
I am so happy I did this  I didn't delete it because its convenient as a log in but I did stop going on it  I never check it now and feel much better having done so  The messenger is still useful as well ,F30
Your dad is ignorant  If a medical professional tells you you have it  odds are doctor is right  and your dad is wrong,F30
Facebook memes are stupid anyway  ,F30
I was without social media for the last 4 years and only recently got it back for networking purposes  I do video production  and my depression has been noticeably worse since I got it back  Coincidence  ,F30
I'm perfectly fine with drugs just helping me manage ,F30
Genesight com they help match med treatment your genome ,F30
Maybe he gives such good advice from these kinds of experiences  ,F30
I had to get an EKG recently  I think because I was going on vraylar  This is very normal ,F30
I'd love to hear why you think so of yourself  Because I want to prove you wrong ,F30
My psychiatrist said medication doesn't alter your personality  It just strengthens the good parts of personality,F30
Do you have health insurance  ,F30
Thanks for the link  Unfortunately  they don't have one in my area ,F30
I did the same thing  It's been two weeks  Got rid of Instagram too  but decided to keep twitter because it's nice to vent every so often  I find I'm waaaayyyy less anxious and definitely more present  It's really helping  Good luck ,F30
"I myself have struggled with this opinion of myself    However I believe in something I was told once  That regardless of someone having it ""worse""  everyone that has gone through something deserves attention and care to heal from it  ",F30
their are a lot of normies but once you find the right page it's pretty good,F30
Sorry  I wish I had something else  ,F30
yup i made an extra account with no friends except for my family for messaging purposes only,F30
  clusterfuck of a social spiderweb  hahahaa exactly ,F30
make an alt acc and add the people u want to message  thats what i did,F30
True  But really there are enough memes on Reddit that my meme intake is already saturated as it is ,F30
yea lol the memes made me laugh and i used it for messaging but fuck it im willing to sacrifice that shit because in the long run  FB makes me feel like crap  ,F30
the good thing about deleting FB is that it instantly gives you the ability to sense fake friends and real friends  ,F30
well it's deleted and no one will be able to access your page or old photos unless you log back in and restore it ,F30
my best friend that i've fallen in love with broke ties with me because i didn't approve of her doing drugs in a groupchat that she wasnt in and she got hurt and broke me off   i hurt so much ,F30
You won't know until you  try it   will you  I mean  what's the alternative  Just go on and on feeling like that  Why go through it when there's hope that things can get better ,F30
aw  that's awful  was the person who showed up nice at least  and did you have a good time with them ,F30
I was really hoping today would be different   It wasn't ,F30
Just did the same  Thanks for inspiring confidence ,F30
The new year and holidays really do that  What's up ,F30
Not latly for me  Weed tis nice but it can make things pretty bad if you use it in the wrong way like if you are anxios or just t sad Its best t avoid for me  ,F30
A family member of mine just passed away because she didn't take care of her teeth for years  She got an infection and it got into her blood stream  So there are certainly serious reasons to stay on top of your dental hygiene  ,F30
You couldn't have described this any better  This is exactly me  especially at work  ,F30
I actually read somewhere recently that you can sign up for the Facebook messenger app even if you're not on Facebook  you just need a cellphone number  I mean  it won't be the disabled account  but you can still use the app ,F30
no problem bro  delete that shit,F30
I read your post  thanks for it,F30
Thanks   it helps to know I'm not the only one    I've joined the gym to get to know a few more people  Think finding more hobbies will help  I guess time will tell  ,F30
I don't know about OP  but if that was an option for me  I don't think I'd worry about having depression anymore lol,F30
Same  you can pm me if you want  I would like to talk to someone else going through chronic depression too ,F30
Someone finally said it   Experience Project was a nice option for me and a lot of people  Unfortunately  it got closed down  ,F30
Thanks for reminding me  I was gonna do that after I graduated and didn't need messenger anymore or as often ,F30
No  Thank you for being that guy  seriously    I'd rather learn than not  Happy New Year to you too ,F30
Telll a doctor your depresseds  Some people find SSRIs helpful  they never did much foe me   wellbutrin was the only antidepressant that ever worked for me  I find CBD helps me too ,F30
Same  Wanna make a pact  Am serious,F30
They don't know what they are missing  Hope you are having a great party    ,F30
Okay brother  Thanks for your concern    ,F30
no problemo  you wont regret it  btw  if you still might need messenger  make an extra account and add the people you might need to message  then download the messenger app on ur phone  ,F30
Rejection always hurts  but it's better to have told her  Now you know she's thinking of other people  you aren't wasting time swooning over something unattainable  ,F30
not been online for 2 years but it cause i forgot my password email ugh,F30
havent since i was 11 or 12,F30
Oh I was thinking more along the lines if there's anything your boyfriend can do to help you  Have you thought about taking anti depressants  ,F30
Tell you what  You pay for me to fix my teeth and I'll take better care of them  Deal ,F30
Nice I think I'm gonna do that too,F30
Man I relate to this so much it's crazy  I'm just stuck in a hole right now  Feel like there's nothing I can do or want to do,F30
Thank you for replying  I didn't think of it that way ,F30
But time isn't a social construct  its very real and its always moving forward ,F30
You can talk to me but I'm gonna fall asleep soon D ,F30
I started facebook over the summer hoping I might be able to stay in touch with friends from high school  graduated in the spring   Nope  Not sure what good I thought it'd do  or why I'm still there ,F30
No problem  same shits been happening to me for last 3 months before I let go  If I had 3 months ago  I would've been much better off today  ,F30
Try to go for a new hobby  Maybe a simple one like drawing,F30
As someone who is also in high school and depressed I'm really holding out until college  I'm going through the roughest time right now but I have hope that college will change things for me ,F30
Sometimes it helps to have a private fb account just for yourself and for the groups you like  memes   humor      That's what I use it for ,F30
Don't worry about the future man  it'll take care of itself ,F30
Did they RSVP    ,F30
I have met some of the wealthiest people in the world who feel empty inside  There is no shame in that   Look at Kate Winslet in Titanic   No one would blame her for being depressed    ,F30
If you don't mind me asking  Were they your friend before you asked ,F30
Same here  I kind of got used to not celebrating anything really  ,F30
For 4 or 5 years  and we still are great friends  ,F30
Would you like to talk to me  I won't go anywhere  ,F30
It's funny i just realized  I never even look at the top or hot posts  Just go straight to new ,F30
She cares about you ,F30
Hey happy new year   I don't have many friends at university either  but I personally prefer it that way  I am singularly focused on my studies and not beholden to anyone  I'm free in a way that most people aren't  ,F30
I just feel like dying all the time now   It used to be every once in a while  but now it's been constant for weeks and I just don't have the drive to keep going,F30
Other then the strict relationship that comes with a patient to doctor sort of thing  I've given her no reason to ,F30
I can't really help you because I feel exactly the same ,F30
Wait I thought it is releasing in februari tho  Also you are in for some fun then I really like how zoom is introduced but I won't spoil anything   ,F30
I'm glad to hear you two are still great friends  Did you take or break or anything after you had told her ,F30
It also depends on her whether remaining friends will work out or not  Some people are cool with knowing someone likes them and others will feel awkward about it and avoid them,F30
Better than just letting yourself drift away from friends forever like me  Let them in,F30
"Deleted mine a couple months ago  Glad to have that huge chunk of negativity gone  Too bad I can't ""delete"" all the bad shit in my head   ",F30
You will push every single friend you have away if you keep doing this I can guarantee  They cannot help you  only you can do that for yourself  Have you thought of seeing a therapist  ,F30
I also feel as if I'm the wrong sex  Like every day,F30
It's been a few days and we've spoken a few time since  I know it's early  but she didn't seem awkward during that time ,F30
I work 72 hours a week and go to school for another 18 because like you said I'm perfectly fine when I'm busy but I can't stand being alone with nothing to do and no one to talk to,F30
Two days ago I ate one protein bar for the whole day  I literally forgot to eat and didn't feel hungry  and woke up super hungry  0 10 experience,F30
Try meeting people online  safely of course  and chatting  I personally cope by daydreaming,F30
Thanks  I always say I want to go back to my home planet  Idk if my people are on this one ,F30
I'm having those same feelings right now  While I'd like to keep in contact and hang out with her  It may be better for me to just take a break from our friendship ,F30
It's nice to know that someone's  anyone really is  there to witness your thoughts  ,F30
Amen  I can't believe I managed to get through it ,F30
I ended up with a few friends over for NYE   cheese was had  Then Jan 1  I had an asthma attack  Woo   Did you end up with YT or games  ,F30
Crossword puzzles  I am still the only person I know to play Pokmon Go  Read  Sudoku  Puzzles  Look at pictures of puppies or kittens  whatever floats your boat  ,F30
I feel for you man  I feel exactly like you feel  Happy new year  Cheers for making it through 2016  ,F30
Find hobbies  then go to clubs  ,F30
Same here   ,F30
My computer is literally the first and last thing I see when I wake up and before I go to bed  That's depressing    I'm pretty sure I'm addicted  I almost wish my parents had never bought me a computer when I was 6 ,F30
Agmatine   Sarcosine are very interesting to me because they both activate AMPA via mTOR like Ketamine  I wish we knew what mechanism causes Ketamine to be far more rapid in its anti depressive effects  ,F30
I wanted to  but didn't get invited to anything  Even sent out a snap with weed  Eventually I just went to sleep since I had to work a long shift today ,F30
Nice  I like to temporarily deactivate when I'm extra down  and usually reactivate once I'm in an upswing,F30
If you're in the US  check out your state's NAMI chapter   they're a great resource in general  and even if there isn't a support group in your area  they might have links to telecommute support groups ,F30
Social media just makes me feel worse  I'd rather not know anything that's going on ,F30
get off all of it  its all dumb  its all a vain attempt to be important  ,F30
After reading through your post  I really hope you can escape from your life and live however you want and wherever you want  It hurt my heart to see what you're going through  ,F30
the obvious thing here is that your friends are just really mean or idk just INcorrect,F30
SMOKE POT DUDE  ,F30
I'm sorry about that    Glad you were able to let him know though  It is a shitty feeling which I can totally empathize with especially now  I hope you feel better  ,F30
I am not looking forward to finding a job after graduation  I am not looking forward to trying dating again  Both seem so daunting as I think of them  ,F30
some people are reaching out and some people are bill boarding their problems just because  Most people don't know what they want  also  this is the internet     take that with a heavy chunk of digital salt ,F30
I no longer feel the need to play music and I was in bands my whole life  I feel your pain  My advice is get 100  off the internet and go travel and tell NOBODY about it  ,F30
I get what you're saying  I already set that boundary the last time we spoke and I'm going to be taking a break from her  Thanks for the advice ,F30
I can relate to this too   I feel tired all the time and just want to sleep    ,F30
Thank you for this  it started happening in sophomore year I think  I will definitely take you up on that offer if I ever finish writing my essays,F30
All the time  Then when i stop responding to them they get all pissed off and act like its in my head,F30
Thank you  people suck  but it's ok to treat yourself   ,F30

You are normal if you have a wife ,F30
Isn't it nice to know they want to see you at least  Makes me feel good ,F30
God I know how you feel   ,F30
That really sucks  I'm envious you're still in contact with people you've known since you were 5  That's amazing  Is there any part of your friendship with them that you still enjoy ,F30
Also depression can mean different things to different people  Some people may only be depressed for a few months  others may have been for their whole life ,F30
That doesnt really help  Trust me,F30
That sucks  People are so unreliable when it comes to going out I swear  ,F30
Facebook and snapchat kinda suck  they just make you feel worse  I'm still on instagram though cause on instagram there are so many accounts dedicated to mental health and they make me feel better in a way,F30
Depends  Events can cause depression  If you lose your SO  job and all your friends it could it you into a long term depression ,F30
Stop watching mainstream hollywood crap and watch arthouse films  There are so many amazing movies out there    ,F30
I'm sorry I didn't reply until now  I don't typically use this account  I'm not saying it's fine to stop exercising  just that the joy you can get from it is counteracted by the anxiety  about your appearance or performance   in my opinion ,F30
"I don't think most people really want to hear a true answer  When I was at school  I was taught the correct greeting was ""Hello  How are you"" ""I'm Good  how are you"" ""I'm good too""",F30
That's the best reason to go      Also  sorry I'm not replying until now ,F30
I always think of W B Yeats and how much he despised 'polite  meaningless words '  When I'm in a cavalier mood and someone asks me how I am I'll cheerfully say  'I'm good thanks  haven't cut myself once today ',F30
I always just go for the generic enthusiastic 'Good  How 'bout you ' or something  I've noticed recently that I'm starting to sound more flat when I say it  even if I intend for it to sound peppy and lighthearted  ,F30
This isn't silly at all  You're feeling something extreme and you shouldn't hide that  What's your favourite film tv show book graphic novel ,F30
You'll do fine  Rooting for you m8,F30
Hows much does it cost if may ask ,F30
I feel like you read my mind and posted how I always feel  I relate to this so much  ,F30
good luck dude  deep breaths and keep calm  depression and anxiety  Ain't nobody got time for that ,F30
What's up  You can dm me if you want ,F30
There have been studies done  there's a direct correlation ,F30
no one here cares about your humblebrag,F30
What's going on  I'm more than happy to talk  using whatever method you like,F30
I'm also 6'5  I could give you the perfect height hug  Can you get to South Africa ,F30

I appreciate your existence ,F30
I'm gonna do this  Thanks for the tip ,F30

People are more than ignorant and rude honestly they forgot what respect means I fully agree with you ,F30
right  i wish i got rid of it sooner  lmao i remember staying up all night before my birthday bc i was worried no one on FB would remember  i was such an addict  i feel wayy better tho  ,F30
I come here to read people's venting when I'm at my worst  That helps me get through these nights  So it is definitely something ,F30
Sometimes life's problems are the best motivators  Keep you head up buddy and look to the future with hope and ambition  ,F30
hahaha thats pretty smart bro   i think ima just subscribe to every decent meme subreddit cos im staying the fuck away from FB  ,F30
yup im staying on insta  recommend any good meme accounts on there  lol ,F30
I know it's hard feeling like you cannot trust others  but all it takes is one good friend to forget about all the bad ones  ,F30
i wish there was a deactivate button on my feelings but nah cuz,F30
i was thinking that   but if it was just for memes n shit i dont think id use it anyway lol ,F30
What does upregulate AMPAR mean exactly  Increase the amount of AMPAR receptors  How does sarcosine and lamictal do this   l theanine is ampar antagonist  and nmdar agonist  Would it be helpful synergistic with sarcosine lamictal or hurtful ,F30
Moving is a tough transition  Your depression may be caused because you are leaving your comfort zone and fighting the move  Try seeing things differently ,F30
Mel can I do that when I have 0 friends I can trust anymore ,F30
"I hate being asked that question too and always feel like I am lying when I say ""good ""  Eventually  you will see a day when you say ""good"" and actually mean it    Live for that day  ",F30
It's greedy of who ,F30
Thank you friend  Saying out loud can sometimes be the hardest part indeed ,F30
Thank you   ,F30
trust me i did that on sooo many people lol,F30
I have like 20 friends on there and only recently started using it again for the depression and social anxiety support groups  ,F30
There are lots of people here who understand  Myself included  You aren't alone  I have the same thoughts and I fight them everyday  We just have to push ourselves harder than everyone else because they have it easy  ,F30
thanks for the support guys but there are also things that I didnt mention in the original statement  i pretty much had everything that any high school guy wants but now its all gone  friends  girlfriends  everything  ,F30
Some I follow that I like  braving  onthebookshelf  satansstarbucks  friedfluff  kttiens  owlturdcomix  Keep in mind that the more you follow  the more reposted memes you see  so you might have to shop around,F30
thank you I will seek help when needed ,F30
If there is one thing I have learned  it's that depression isn't logical,F30
If it was such a serious concern then you must have been very strong through the year  I'm proud of you too ,F30
fuck you  You have fucking idea  ,F30
"H is for happy U is for you G is for good   Mix it up around and ""You  good happy"" ",F30
If you want memes  reddit is the main source   ,F30
Deleting fb was one of my first steps towards recovery from depression,F30
Im just staring at this text box trying to figure out what to say  Im so fucking empty  ,F30
"some people are getting used to just saying ""I'm fine""",F30
Good  You won't miss it,F30
Your comment seemed lonely here  Allow me to accompany you ,F30
Looks like they could've stopped at NEWS and after that they padded it out somewhat,F30
Just a heads up in case you didn't know if you are on any SSRI's maybe talk to your doctor about taking St John's Wort  ,F30
Hey man  I don't know much about body building  but if you are thinking of setting up a home studio you can teach yourself a lot via YouTube  Maybe even invest in some mirrors too so you can check your form ,F30
If you only care about memes  Twitter is a thing,F30
Meetup com has a bipolar support group in my area  try it for yours   I attended once  before my work schedule changed   Six or seven others with bp1 or bp2   ,F30
I'm 18  And I see what you mean  ,F30
Thats why I watch depressing movies ,F30
You don't own her  ,F30
I was without facebook pretty much until 2 3 years ago  and only now use it for practical stuff  like quickly getting a hold of someone  I avoid looking at other people's pages  especially people I know  it will ONLY cause sadness ,F30
And winning even in a small ordeal is very rewarding  ,F30
That IS AWESOME  Dude ,F30
The Gregorian calendar is ,F30
I care  I'm here for you  You're not alone,F30
You don't have to deal with it alone  You have the community here  and as much as I hate to say it  professional help might be a good idea  They will give you tools to help deal with it,F30
I like Mr Robot  or the first season of True Detective  I guess I have a thing for tortured characters  ,F30
That's pretty cool  I'm sure I'll figure something out eventually  Thank you for talking with me it has really helped ,F30
No worries mate  all the best   ,F30
Hmmm  well for me going to sleep is one step closer to waking up and dealing with tomorrow  It's gonna be a long night     Best of luck friend ,F30
I'm so glad that you stopped and that you're still with us  Don't let the list of things you want to do empty  keep adding things to the list ,F30
but like your title says  you're alive  If you're still underage  your parents knowing is a good thing  They're there to support you ,F30
Actually   They aren't  They think my depression is something I made up to act badly   For example  saying I do not want to argue over my bedroom'd situation  ,F30
Hopefully when your parents have time with the psychologist they may change their viewpoint  Another adult confirming what you are telling them,F30
Yeah  I enjoy the celebrations of new year  the fireworks and such  But then it just comes back to feeling as bad as before ,F30
Don't ask yourself 'why ' Depression never makes sense  I stopped asking why a long time ago ,F30
maybe just try to focus on getting through the rough bits than the why  it helps me sometimes ,F30
Although I didn't deleted facebook  its synces my address book   I have stopped using it myself  and it is a big relief ,F30
Don't live with such horrible people  that will help a bit   ,F30
i will everyday man  thanks for responding it means alot,F30
I'm really  really glad you didn't  ,F30
"TIL that you actually sound ""right"" to yourself through a record than normally speaking  No wonder people hate me   I want to stop talking entirely ",F30
Thank you  if that can be considered a compliment  So what's your story  I mean how come you're on this subreddit ,F30
 hugs  I'm so sorry you're going through such a rough time  ,F30
yeahhh no one's gonna remember my birthday this year but im fine with that  and LMAO ,F30
not all heroes wear capes  thnks dude,F30
Well she is not wrong  I would have picked her up  But breaking up for this is a bit too much  Maybe she will come back  break ups are not always permanent  ,F30
I know  It's awesome  Many people may find this subreddit very useful and supportive  but might not know about it  Hooray ,F30
I'm so sorry  Sometimes people truly suck ,F30
Yes  I live in Texas   I will go take a look at this immediately  thank you for the resource ,F30
Escapism is the way to cope with things  I think that most of people really deep inside know how things truly are but are too busy to think about it  It's when we are alone that we get darker thoughts are are our true selves  ,F30
damn  all i gotta say to that is AMEN,F30
Not really  It wasn't even till the next day   Only within minutes or hours  I feel horrible again ,F30
It sucks to care for someone so much only to be forgotten,F30
 3  a big warm hug  ,F30
It sounds like you have places to go and meanings to seek  I'm excited for you ,F30
I sure hope so  thank you ,F30
You need to keep taking them though  The way I see it  meds don't really change who we are  we're still the same person really  they just increase our level of functioning somewhat  ,F30
 hugs  I'm sorry it's been such a rough time  Sending you all the love and strength to hang in there  3,F30
I think that's the best gift to yourself  to have that resolution and to stick to it no matter what  ,F30
I'm sorry to hear about your breakup  It's kinda comforting to know I'm not the only one who feels this way though  Hopefully we figure our shit out  Cheers from the U S of A ,F30
Did the same does feel much better  Also there are much better sources for memes than FB ,F30
Reading this made me tear up  I am in mourning too  I'm so sorry for your loss  The pain must be simply immense and indescribable  But I believe we'll get through  Big hugs from me to you  ,F30
Hey bud  I care ,F30
Thank you  And I am sorry  I know how uncomfortable and disheartening it is  ,F30
I am your first paragraph  Although I do feel like I'm at the tail end of things going catastrophic and I might get my life together  Shoot me a pm if you'd like to talk  As long as you're a male we could be clones ,F30
Thank you  this gives me hope  I've been stuck in that next day cycle  and it's scaring me to not have control over my future and thoughts  Maybe your ride is due for an upgrade  hope life treats you well friend ,F30
Hey  I'm here for you  Would you like to talk more about this ,F30
How did you met her and why did she dumped you  ,F30
What exactly happened  ,F30
I agree  Sometimes I feel like shit when I'm off of them  but whether it's for two days or two weeks that I've been off of them  I always come back to them  ,F30
I'm here to listen  if you need to vent anymore ,F30
Me either  Like I'm lucky if I get small 3 4 hour blocks of solid sleep ,F30
Hang in there   I never would have thought I would be  in the same mind set of stay alive but since last year I'm struggling ,F30
Fuck friends who don't reply to you after you send a text message  period  If they can't be bothered then neither can I  ,F30
Dealing with constant depression is   exhausting    We all know how you feel   you're not alone in this   Whatever you do  just take it one day at a time  ,F30
Take good care of yourself OP   Give a hug and you get a hug ,F30
yeah i dont browse fb anymore I just use messenger for free sms,F30
There was a time when Elon Musk was bald and technically cash poor  Check the pic  http   images boomsbeat com data images full 4273 paypal jpg jpg,F30
if she's intoxicated with social media then dont pretend to be ok with it  i aint gonna tell you to break up with her cause idk the full story but id recommend you have a serious talk with her  you'll know what to do then ,F30
it really sucks when you have to remind someone to look up from their phones    props to u for deleting that shit  ,F30
jesus died for people like you  thnks brother,F30
Gr8 m8  keep it up   live life for yourself ,F30
Speaks to me on so many levels  Thank you ,F30
These comments mean the world to her and me  thank you too ,F30
Thank you for sharing   We often discuss my past but i don't really have a reason for PTSD  My life hasn't had any really high impact negative events  It's been more a boring pointless slog ,F30
My New Years resolution make it until Saturday when I can finally get back to my psychiatrist    Long term resolutions overwhelm me haha I might just start having new week resolutions ,F30
 r BPDlovedones can help you  ,F30
       that small connection can sometimes be the thing to make you keep going   Exactly this   ,F30
Your post reads like a classic example of Borderline Personality Disordered abuse  It can be very confusing  please don't blame yourself  I am  unfortunately  not skilled with words  But if you post there  Im sure someone will give the advice you need ,F30
Thank you  I have gotten the post up over there  She has tried to say that I am bi polar on top of my depression  even though my therapist said otherwise ,F30
i stopped using facebook years ago   hands down one of the best decisions i made in my entire life  ,F30
Sorry to hear that  if she was already leaving then coming back  then it was going to happen  Best of luck ,F30
just noticed your username  chuckled a little  cheers m8,F30
people here dont need saving and then two days later you can see 20 posts about how no one is helping them ,F30
Anger is also a form of depression  Which is why I don't get bent out of shape bc sum1 is probably as far down the rabbit hole as I am ,F30
I only use Facebook to   judge new pictures that girls I went to high school with put up  Literally the only reason why I still have it up ,F30
That site never helped with my social anxiety  Since I deleted it  I have read more  watched more movies and slowly getting my garage ready for woodworking  ,F30
you ever have those days where you can't do anything else except focus on how shit you feel  that ,F30
Me too  These aren't real people  They are just the mask people want you to see ,F30
I'd call the police    They record the conversations I think right  Those people need to be fired before they get anyone killed   I'm so sorry that happened to you  ,F30
Same thing happened to me  She was acting like talking to me was really getting in the way of whatever else she had to be doing ,F30
Was raped a lot growing up,F30
Anyone who disagrees with suicide,F30
This is something that I want to do  slowly weening myself off of social media  Not good  especially when I constantly compare myself to others and look at my old friends posts,F30
I think you might have dysthimia  ,F30
"Just tell your doctor exactly what you said here  maybe add at the end something like ""I think I have some sort of depression or something  like dysthimia or some stuff"" ",F30
Good luck mate  Keep reminding yourself of how important this one thing is  and keep your focus on that  Fuck the depression  keep getting up when it knocks you down ,F30
Yes its sad realizing that time never stops  I know what you mean ,F30
Going through this right now  Based on the recommendations of my PCP  P Doc  and Pharmacists I'm switching over from the lithium   clonazepam combo to Latuda  Hopefully this helps ,F30
Thats fascinating  I wonder if thats why i have a addictive personality ,F30
You've endured so much  and you've accomplished so much  You're strong  I also have PTSD due to growing up with a lot of physical and mental emotional abuse  Feel free to message me if you ever would like to talk    ,F30
I'm actually switching off Latuda soon for some problems it's causing me  But my experience has been mostly positive ,F30
Mate seriously  be proactive about it  If you let depression and anxeity be in the back of your head when you're trying study it's going to weigh you down  please put yourself first  Good luck ,F30
Agreed abort it asap if you're even questioning wanting it   A child is the last thing you need right now ,F30
For obvious reasons I can't say exactly what happened  I've spent major parts of my life trying to help this person  but eventually got rejected hard when I thought we were friends ,F30
Ugh  I know the type,F30
I was going to suggest this as well  If your area does not have one  start one  It isn't too hard  You might be able to find  with the help of this website  a mental health advocate in your area  ,F30
Thank you so much I appreciate it ,F30
Yeah  I can understand even that ,F30
Happy birthday  mate  I hope you feel better ,F30
What are your exams ,F30
I hope you'll feel better soon  happy birthday  ,F30
oh no  don't do that  have you tried other meds  I know cymbalata worked amazing for me  but my insurance no longer covers it for me unfortunately ,F30
yeah I think so too  It's how my brain works  I'm not that worried that it's dangerous for me  It sort of bums me out though  I feel disappointed with myself ,F30
I thought this year would be a new start but then I realised just because the year has changed doesn't mean my illness has magically disappeared  ,F30
Yep  8 months and I just want to kill myself for being an unlovable shit  ,F30
I'm glad you think so ,F30
The first one is Calculus then Modern Physics then Java ,F30
So maybe it is situational  but getting help could still be very useful  would you consider seeing a therapist ,F30
I honestly don't know at this point,F30
I've been there  It sure is depressing  Have you gone to councilling ,F30
Yeah it's an amphetamine  Ya you probably wouldn't want to take it if you have heart problems ,F30
They're a couple of shows on PBS about building houses and wood working ,F30
Ya it seems to be helping  I still feel down sometimes when I haven't slept right though ,F30
This couldn't possibly be more inaccurate  As a former hotline worker  at my call center  we were all volunteers  The people who are there have gone through hours and hours of training and are donating their time to help people in need    ,F30
Whether or not calls are recorded depends on the state  in some states its illegal to record calls without consent  in others you can   ,F30
I really relate  thank god someone feels the same way,F30
The first step is getting through your grieving process  it's the toughest part but eventually you'll come out of the other end of that dark tunnel  After that take it one day at a time  reassure yourself that it's his loss and move on ,F30
Don't apologize  it's not worth it  ,F30
You know what depressed people need more of  Harsh criticisms  Harsh criticism will make everything better   sarcasm,F30
i truly hope things get better for you    ,F30
same here i think about more than one time a day  ,F30
So sorry for you  I hope everything gets better ,F30
i am on zyprexa it doesn't help much  ,F30
I think I speak for everyone here when I say we care about you and are here for you   If you ever need anyone to talk to  I'm here ,F30
Even the small victories count  ,F30
Happy Birthday  do yourself something nice today if you can      I wish you the best,F30
Have you thought of trying something else  Never heard of zyprexa,F30
Hey do you wanna talk about it   Im here for you pls have a think of it before you do something wrong ,F30
they ridicule you for their own insecurities  who gives a shit where you are in life it's no ones business but yours  ,F30
i think i spelled it wrong it doesn't matter my parents don't want me on anything stronger than that  ,F30
i dreamed once that i was in a relationship with my crush  as i woke up and realized it was a dream i felt absolutely devasteted for the first 5 minutes or so   still hurts tho    I hope you feel better soon  ,F30
I do the same thing  Writing them down may help  I'm learning to appreciate things again as well,F30
Hey  sorry I only just saw this  I think what this sub shows is that people do care  it just maybe takes living with this condition to be able to properly empathise  Any time you want to talk i'm happy to ,F30
Right  I want to have something to focus on  Much rather be physically tired,F30
Glad for you  I hope things get even better ,F30
You two made my whole day right there  i just wanna thank you for sharing it   ,F30
I'm stuck in a really bad financial situation and my living situation is extremely toxic  I feel vulnerable  I can't afford my car anymore and there's something wrong with it anyway ,F30
Contact someone higher up  like a manager,F30
thats just so true  ,F30
Those are very beautiful  She has great skill ,F30
I look forward to more of these ,F30
Do you still have feelings  Now that you are on an even keel are you realizing you truly did not want to end it but did it because you were going through an episode or struggles so you pushed them away ,F30
The first step is to stop thinking someone else is your whole world   You are your whole world   period ,F30
It's almost universally an unpaid position  ,F30
01110011 01100101 01101110 01100100 01110011 00100000 01100100 01101001 01100111 01101001 01110100 01100001 01101100 00100000 01101000 01110101 01100111 ,F30
Holy Moly  As soon as i looked at these  I got goosebumps all over my body   Everything is so accurate down to the last detail  Thank you to you and your sister for sharing this with us  Lots of love xo,F30
 Bear Hug  Hug you harder then you could imagine  And i rub your back with both of my hands  I whisper into your ear one day at a time  Lots of love from me to you xxoo,F30
I hope it works out for you  it really helped me a lot ,F30
Sad to see you go   ,F30
I just deleted mines about a week ago it feels sloop good  However I did make a fake account just so I could stay in contact with messenger for a few of my real friends  That way no one will ever find me ,F30
Sounds like they dont get paid well and are overworked but its still no reason to treat you like that ,F30
Right   I'm surprised he is not banned but I bet it's because he used alt accounts  ,F30
Thank you  I'm happy to not be alone in this situation  You did make me feel better  and you got me on better mood  I wish you a great New Year and I hope that someday we will live a great life ,F30
It's not just the gym    Everyone  everywhere is too busy being self conscious to pay a fraction as much attention to you than you think they are   My whole quality of life went up 30  once I realized that  ,F30
   Thanks for putting a bit of light into this glum world   3,F30
Yeah man  Keep going  Have you ever thought about going to the gym ,F30
Urghh fuck that then  I deleted Facebook and Twitter a couple of years back and it's one of the few things I look back on with positivity  ,F30
Very cool artwork and relatable as well   ,F30
I get carried away with fantasy's too  You should look up maladaptive daydreaming  I like it though  It's a nice escape  ,F30
Try to do 4 tomorrow  GJ,F30
In your case smoking weed is just procrastinating your pain then your problems come back you need to face the hard reality,F30
You should throw up and call for help  People can be shit  but they can also be wonderful and you can't live without those fuckers ,F30
The first one  it looks like an elastic band nearly  like the heart is going to be ripped into the past leaving no heart for the future  Also  the last hand not clasping on the support one  well       ,F30
Sad to see another person go   ,F30
I might check out some podcasts and i didn't know there was a no sleep one  I used to love that sub a couple of years back  It went abit down hill from what I remember but I'll certainty check it out  ,F30
I did two too out of inspiration or spite  who knows  So thanks  I guess ,F30
Couldn't agree more   I love Rick   Morty  futurama and American dad  I can just switch off and enjoy them    There's a few series I like tbf  The inbetweeners  the office  it crowd  But fuck films  ,F30
To clarify  of course  there's nothing wrong with using them ,F30
You're welcome  Unfortunately I have no experience with Agmatine but from the literature I've read  it appears to exert its antidepressant effect through NMDA signaling inhibition  So maybe a different mechanism from sarcosine but it leads to the same downsteam effects ,F30
Man as someone who went out of his way to find the correct pills combo  you're probably not going to die  But good luck ,F30
Oh yeah I see  you were saying our measure of time is a social construct  tru tru,F30
7Cups doesn't take calls regarding suicidal ideation intent  Did this once and they instantly apologized but told me to go seek professional help call the suicide hotline instead  I'm guessing it's cause they're not trained to take such calls ,F30
Thank you for your advice  I myself have 2 cats that I will sit with when I need it  But personally i feel like talking to an actual person is better  Hope you find a way to deal with your struggles too  ,F30
You can quit being bipolar anytime you want  It's not real  ,F30
i am so sorry you don't deserve  this nobody deserves this     ,F30
 deleted                     0 5819      What is this   https   pastebin com 64GuVi2F 93628 ,F30
This is why the only person I do this to  is somebody who knows me well enough to know why I do this  I'd never just randomly do that to somebody  though  That's       why  ,F30
Thanks for your kind words man  appreciate it  I wish you a great your too  thanke man  ,F30
Or post here the number  an hotline like that shouldn't hang up on people       OP  if you want to have a chat send me a PM  I promise I won't hang up   ,F30
Take care of yourself first and foremost   They can wait ,F30
 This is how I feel every someone asks me that question  https   www reddit com r depression comments 5ggohn    ,F30
No matter how shitty your wage is  if you work in such an environment  hotline for depressed people  you shouldn't morally hang up on people    If you do that  well  you don't deserve a job in a place like that,F30
Thank you so much  That's solid advice and really helps me  I've been meaning to find a therapist and talk to them  I think that'd do wonders for me  Thank you for caring ,F30
I hope deression is soon just a part of your past  3,F30
Thank you  I'll show her the comments is a bit  3,F30
And thank YOU for feeling her art  Hopefully depression is soon in your past ,F30
Thank you so much  It's great to know I have people out there who understand ,F30
I brush my teeth twice a day every day and have been since I was a toddler  it's just mostly habit  I don't feel comfortable going to bed without brushing my teeth first    i just feel dirty otherwise ,F30
Thank you  You may be getting a pm from me soon  Happy new year,F30
I'm rarely on FB anymore   I periodically contact friends through messenger and visit a couple of groups   I can't handle the onslaught of fear and hate   ,F30
This is fucked up  I'm glad you're still here though,F30
Damn  My loss of interest of everything has taken over  and it feels like a chore to do anything ,F30
It's even more sad that I'm going to go out by killing myself  There's no doubt about it ,F30
Thank you for your kind words  Depression is a daily battle one must not give up   Am trying to spread my wisdom to all of those in this subreddit feeling desperate and unsure where to turn    xoxo,F30
I think it's worth apologizing if you think it will help you and your ex  If you think it might hurt someone  don't do it  ,F30
Good to know  Another reason for me to avoid hotlines  Instead I will call a close friend if I ever get to that stage  Oh    wait    I have no friends   ,F30
In my country a lot of those working on a hotline are volunteers ,F30
Thanks   It will probably help that her pdoc is the one who treated her when she was admitted for her first manic episode    6 weeks in the hospital    and has given a diagnosis of BP with psychotic elements   ,F30
We can't provide diagnostic advice  but I do want to say that mania is  pretty much by definition  outside off what a normal person might do  Lithium is not bad at all compared to what happens when you're manic ,F30
You clearly don't understand how texting works  If you want to speak to them fucking call them ,F30
How the fuck do they go about their lives knowing that they could've killed someone ,F30
Taking it day by day,F30
I hope your year gets better  You aren't garbage  and someone out there loves you I know it  ,F30
Wonderful  I'm sorry that you're going through this ,F30
yep    i suck at making new friendships  mainly only meet people through my social friends that i do have,F30
You are welcome  I am glad to help,F30
People need to stop judging  Seriously ,F30
So true   ,F30
I like it  sorry for this disease we all share that's made you feel this way but you're good at shaping it ,F30
Thanks I ll try my best ,F30
I have the most addictive personality  i toked a joint last night and all i could think of is MORE MORE MORE   i think i should stay off the shit  cheers,F30
What are you doing these days slays me  it's like an instant conversation killer that screws with your mood,F30
Sounds less like a need to control your ambitions and more a need to plan out and follow through with them    take some risks  roll the dice  you might just find you can achieve what you dream ,F30
I think that's a good goal  ,F30
Become a cashier  I did and it's an easy job for being depressed for me  You work alone at the till but you have coworkers  You do some small talk with customers but they always leave you alone once they paid   ,F30
Thanks but I most certainly am garbage  and nobody loves me and my year probably won't get better  ,F30
Yep absolutely  I'm surprised how many posts share my feelings in a world where people look at me like I'm some sort of outcast criminal ,F30
This is not on you  Sometimes I internalize blame when someone does me wrong  but that is another habit that contributes to depression  The people working at that hotline clearly don't have appropriate training and lack empathy  It says nothing about you  nothing ,F30
light at the end of the tunnel even for the worst of us   3 good work brutha  you sound like one strong mf ,F30
I feel like that a lot  I still do things though and push through  Sometimes it helps and I feel a bit motivated but sometimes it doesn't   at least a few chores get done and I feel less shitty about it  ,F30
I second this  Writing down your thoughts will help you organize them  I would try yoga or reading to help calm your mind  ,F30
Fuckin A right  Being socially awkward anxious might as well be a death sentence  where you're expected to do the killing  ,F30
Thanks a ton   ,F30
Thanks a lot buddy    ,F30
There is nothing your doctor hasn't heard before  Tell them what you've just said here and be as honest as you can be  I hope you are able to get some help ,F30
Last time I was off for any length of time  I lost my job  Took me an afternoon  Arrived at work  got more and more down  a customer picked on me for looking down  and I snapped at her  Fired  ,F30
"That's shitty  I've been having a lot of up and down days recently because of my ""fuck these pills"" attitude and being in the military just makes things a lot worse ",F30
I fell in love with my best friend  She didn't feel the same ,F30
I don't think that's very good for your health tbh,F30
Most nights I am kept awake by all the embarrassing things I've done and horrible imaginations of people turning on me  I too have a artificial Christmas tree that looks pretty in the dark  It makes me feel a warm glow of christmas y cheer  ,F30
I did that once it turned out bad I'm not very friendly when I'm down  ,F30
The ones I tried all bored me after a while  but I'll definitely give the ones you suggested a try   Maybe they're better   ,F30
i used to go  but my energy levels have been so low and fatigue so high that i cant think of it at the moment  i want to increase my activity levels    may b then one day  ,F30
whtever rings your bell   ,F30
You and me both  Every day is waiting to end into another day to try and make it through without sobbing in the corner telling yourself all the terrible dark thoughts no one deserves to think  ,F30
Happy birthday  Prozac made me suicidal  it's not for everyone  Don't give up on meds if you have depression because they do work  I'd be dead without them  If you want to talk to a bored anonymous soul  I'm here lol ,F30
Can you get some help  It sounds like everything is out of control and you can't deal with it all on your own  Or maybe you can  but it'd be really fucking hard  Which is understandable ,F30
If it's not easy to talk about it maybe bring a note explaining things  Maybe print off this post and show it to your doctor   ,F30
At the moment  I'd be happy to be diagnosed as a green martian  if it got me setup on those three meds   Still not a bad idea to ask why if you're curious ,F30
hell yeah  my exercise routine tens to be that small sometimes  but if its all i can manage I am fucking proud,F30
You must be your whole world for no one can be your island paradise  ,F30
Find the 8 brocades by Mimi on YouTube  it's a great series of gentle exercises you can do your whole life ,F30
No  we were hanging out and actually chatting most of the night  then at about 5 to 12 I see her in the arms of my friends cousin  they make out at midnight and I spend the rest of my night on my phone ,F30
push ups are really hard to do  are you going to go for 3 tomorrow   ,F30
Do you have a primary care doctor  What I did was I told my doctor I was feeling depressed  and they referred me to a psychiatrist   Birth control pills Have been linked to depression so that could be a factor  ,F30
Fastest relief would be AMPA activation   Ketamine  Agmatine  Sarcosine  or Psilocybin mushrooms ,F30
Yes I do  I think I will make an appointment this week  Thank you  ,F30
Yes I do  I think I will make an appointment this week  Thank you  ,F30

It only gets me frustrated really  Best thing for me to do is avoid people so I can avoid getting hurt ,F30
Good  Please come back and let us know how it goes  I know for me it's hard to open up to people so I just had to sort of grit my teeth and blurt it out ,F30
Yeah  that's pretty much depression  I always comment with this link because it could help you better understand yourself       http   www psnpaloalto com wp wp content uploads 2010 12 Depression Diagnostic Criteria and Severity Rating pdf,F30
I always have to lie and say I'm doing fine  I hate lying but people don't really care about me anyways ,F30
If you're still friends it's completely acceptable to text him  Don't go overboard with a million texts but let him know you're feeling lost and down and want to talk to someone  ,F30
Thank you  I appreciate it  I will try to make the best of every situation and it will probably get better in the future ,F30
Man  that sucks  Sounds like a really heavy semester with six classes ,F30
That sucks man  girl problems are the worst  These things fuck me up the most ,F30
Yeah and i was actually feeling really good that night aswell,F30
Same  I have all the things a girl could need  except a car  but still just feel like doing nothing all day  ,F30
On Prozac  and I think it's numbing me as well  not in a good way   It either could be my depression or Prozac that's causing this ,F30
Take small steps  There's a sub I think it's r bodyweightfitness which can get you started  I think doing exercise helps,F30
I hate sad dreams  Or those dreams where I'm late for work or school  They can ruin my day ,F30
Prozac  60 mg daily  I still have plenty of depressive episodes ,F30
Yeah bones is just a god  I couldn't really get into  B but they slowly grew on me   but still more a SESH fan  Will give Sadlythats   a listen    kind of slept on Rotten ,F30
Yep and yep  I don't know if it's depression or the medication that's doing it   ,F30
because i am a loser,F30
Woops  screwed up the name  haha  I'm going to look up more things by him ,F30
Will it stick  Or do I have to keep this regimen up indefinitely   I was hoping for a fix  not relief,F30
Not too much out of your way  it seems    ,F30
the problem is actually thinking I am worthy of success  Of thinking that i am actually good enough to succeed  ,F30
Yeah  I'm gonna bring it up to my doctor for sure then  The thing is that I started taking Prozac as soon as my depression started  so I don't know if it's worse than before,F30
you should report that person it's clearly not a job for them ,F30
Happy New Years Internet stranger  Hope life is slowly getting better for you and know that people out there care about you ,F30
Yeah  and the legal culpability they'd face even would be horrendous   ,F30
I thought of another good one you might like  Spooky Black   Without U   just don't let the video creep you out haha,F30
Huh  The years just aren't something I pay attention too  Pretty sure I just don't want to think about time progressing  ,F30
"thanks x2   from someone whos got a bad habit of just browsing ""hot""",F30
I agree  I've tried to die with carefully calculated doses  several times the lethal dose  of IV narcotics combined with hard alcohol and Benzos and I woke up both times in my own vomit  It's just so hard to shut the body down  ,F30
Am in exact same situation  My exams start on thursday and I don't  know what to do  ,F30
I didn't know what I was doing  Just being reckless really but I found out dying is a lot harder than in the movies  Your body just has a natural instinct to survive ,F30
How old are you  You can grow out of the self loathing  ,F30
wow  thats so rude  if you ever need to talk to someone that isnt a bitch  you can always hit me up  hang in there  3,F30

I'm gonna think about how to approach it and come back to you if I think of anything  but I really think it's something important to do  Guilt is a shitty feeling ,F30

Are you sure its not my fault  One of the boys keeps trying to contact me for sex but says he will never date me because I'm not attractive enough and a gross slut,F30
They said they couldn't of raped me because Im not attractive enough and fat and gross,F30
so true  everyone has their own chemistry and responds differently  it sucks that so much gets put on our shoulders when we are at our worst  Its like asking a prisoner to choose between isolation or suicide watch ,F30
sorry if i repeated the other reply i was writing it while there were no comments,F30
Understanding that starting a business could be high risk and deciding not to do it seems like a reasonable decision  It'd probably be more manic if you realized it could be a bad decision and impulsively dumped your entire savings into it anyways  ,F30
Fuck that  I'll take any saving or advice I can get ,F30
I am 100  sure  I am 90  sure they planned this  ,F30
It's definitely more true in some situations than others  With the internet  it's easier to be able to talk to people  Also it depends on the environment you're in when you're trying to talk with someone ,F30
Nah  they just need to go outside  Fresh air is real antidepressant ,F30
Awesome    Can I have the dosages you used as well   Also would you say that Mindfulness and Psilocybin are the two most powerful drivers of this stack ,F30

Ignoring emotions is a coping mechanism I use a lot  It's left me pretty dulled  It also left me unable to deal with emotions  But it is a good idea to not get close to anyone that fast  That's healthy  ,F30
Why put more energy into something  hoping to have a different outcome ,F30
Awesome  I'm feeling the worst I've felt in years  I can't think straight  Any info shared is very important to me  Thank you very much ,F30
Also find yourself a hobby you'd be amazed at the wonders it can do  Especially when you see the progress you've done  ,F30
I understand  but what if the outcome is different ,F30
That's a feature  not a bug  If you want help  that's what r gettingoverit is for  r depression is not meant to be a recovery centric sub  ,F30
Why would they do something so horrible,F30
Okay  I understand  Do you know the approximate time that you'll be able to afford help  And okay  I think that making the log will be a good idea  to determine when you feel the most down ,F30
I am actually wanting to do this  I didn't realize I wanted to do this  but now I want to do it  Esp  with the teeth  They need work ,F30
Great job man  I'm too lazy to exercise but working with my dad gets me doing it  You have my admiration for getting it done ,F30
Most people here only care about their own problems ,F30
I guess if all the strangers you meet are mean  ,F30
Yes I've had this before on Wellbutrin butttttt that was after taking 2 grams of it ,F30
Two things may need to happen  I need some energy to try again  I may need to let things deteriorate more so I feel like I'm making progress,F30
lmao i'm on 300mg  150mg twice a day  so like uh what does this mean for me,F30
Okay  I understand  How do you feel about retrying therapy ,F30
Okay  I understand  Do you foresee that happening ,F30
Could be sensitive to it  I do know the hallucinations you are talking about tho  so you aren't crazy,F30
Okay  I understand  the same things have happened to me  How do you feel about them not believing you ,F30
Skip your next dose and call your doctor as soon as you're able,F30
What even is friendship  How do you do it  Where is the line between being friends with someone and just talking on a forum    Besides that  I just can't understand people and they can't understand me ,F30
Well there's only one thing for us to work on  get better at meeting with strangers ,F30

I met some girl online too which I'm over but sometimes still think of her she was my first but I hope maybe 2017 changes my view of staying single to maybe putting myself out there just make things better letting my heart heal,F30

Okay  I understand  Is there anything else you'd like to talk about ,F30
What about Psilocybin  I thought that was the new miracle depression drug that they're hyping up nowadays,F30
And I tried to kill myself by stabbing myself but my friend stopped me and now I'll be getting therapy pills   ,F30
I shower everyday for a whole hour it's relaxing from my stress and anxiety lets me think and cry it's a safe place for me,F30

Focus on the love passion art aspect of your artistic field  otherwise it really won't go anywhere if you're trying to approach it like a normal job with success in mind rather than artistic expression  ,F30
To your edit   I always get energised when I write stuff down  It helps because it's no longer all in your head ,F30
That person sounds like a douche  That's not your fault ,F30
We are fault seeking society  ,F30
pretty much i feel like i'm used and overlooked most of the time ,F30
Not that great  That's why we rarely talk anymore  They think I'm a liar  So I don't really have anyone I can talk to about things  I have 1 friend but she stays busy so I try not to bug her with my problems ,F30
I can relate to this showers are the only moments whihc somehow feel my own ,F30
I don't  just a few months ago I noticed I was depressed  everything going wrong in my life  I don't know why I couldn't focus with class and why I lost the strive to do anything  I've only kept this to myself ,F30
 r getting over it  or  r GetMotivated are great resources   I personally follow the Middle Path  A Buddhist way of life  ,F30
there's an endless supply of other people     they're just not really interested in getting to know you,F30
I feel you on that 100   I want to have a girlfriend so badly  I think about it 90  of my day and then when the time comes  I shoot myself in the foot ,F30
It has to do with the way we define exercise  Exercise can be walking around your house for 5 minutes or doing some simple stretches  Have you tried that  ,F30
I know the feeling of being overlooked  I am the youngest of four and the third daughter  A life of hand me downs and last choice  ,F30
setting realistic expectations and realistic goals can really help with that  It's worth just setting 5 10minute goals for walking outside weather permitting  or stretching on a yoga mat ,F30
Maybe another time  Thank you for helping me work through this  I woke in a better way this morning and went outside and walked for about 15 20 min ,F30
You should see someone  it's a win win  Either you get the help you need to you're proven to be fine and your parents no longer need to be worried,F30

Good for you for setting realistic goals and looking to improve your activity levels  ,F30
With machines replacing more and more work being social  outgoing and charismatic will be even more important if you are looking for work ,F30

r MaladaptiveDreaming  I have the same disorder  you are not alone  It is hard to live with but helps with pain or depression  Had it all my life   Usually has a trigger  mine is music  and can include repetitive movement ,F30
Do me a favour and try and answer me a simple question    It's going to seem condescending  but it really isn't  Are you in pain ,F30
Yes I thought the same thing lately  When I'm depressed I am really clumsy  while the rest of the time I don't break anything or do anything clumsy ,F30

Your post made me think of Notes from Underground by Dostoevsky  The main character was a dreamer  who would get mad at the inactivity his dreaming would result in  I recommend this little book to everyone  even those who don't enjoy literature ,F30
That's a nice way to look at it  thank you   ,F30
No  I've never mentioned it to my parents  I want them to be happy and not worrying about me  Should I tell them and get meds     ,F30

Yeah well I'm going to graduate with over 150k in debt with a starting salary about maybe 50k  I hate everything,F30
I don't have kik but we can talk here if you like,F30
Thanks for the reply     I agree that it's come pretty close to full mania  something my psych and I need to keep an eye on  ,F30
Seems sort of random  care to explain  I'm not american by the way so I can't just move to LA easily even if I wanted to,F30
thank you for your input  I sent you a pm  Wish you a happy year  too ,F30
Thanks for the reply   I'm glad I'm not alone  I agree  it's so easy to get sucked in  ,F30
You were raped  You are not a slut  and you did nothing wrong  Please consider going to your parents  and to the police  ,F30
Hey okay I sent you a pm  thanks,F30
If you don't mind my asking  what meds are you on  Message me if you'd rather not make it public ,F30
Cudi's new album has been helping me,F30
Well done  that's a really big step  It took me my entire adult life before I went for help ,F30
I have never smoked weed  Thanks for the well wishes  I don't know why mental health is so stigmatized  ,F30
This is true  I'll talk with my doctor and see what will be the best course  of action  Thank you   ,F30
I hope I can one day  Idk though  I fear I may push my bullshit on others  Got a lot of therapy before I think I'll be ready for that  ,F30
Sex drive  Appetite   o,F30
I had the arm implant I removed it almost 2 weeks ago after a year it made me crazy and gain a lot of weight ,F30
And trying to cheerlead yourself into not believing those dark thoughts once they do start seeping into your consciousness ,F30
I don't even need to know you to know you are not a slut and that you are an amazing person  Please don't be ashamed  you survived an attack  that already shows infinitely more courage than these disgusting excuses for boys will ever have ,F30
Thank you  I owe it to my friend who helped me find the courage to actually realize that I need help and that its not something to be ashamed of ,F30
And then when you do finally find a piece of reality to grasp onto  you beat yourself up  and feel like an empty void for feeling like this in the first place and it's the never ending cycle  ,F30
go help at a soup kitchen or go buy groceries for some homeless people  anything that involves helping others  it'll jump start things,F30
That's a shame  How good is your insurance ,F30
Yer I think that's the anxiety  When I'm bad I can't even talk properly and become stupid and clumsy  ,F30
Shit  I come from a very broke household so liability  The bare miminum to not have no insurance ,F30
I've cut my ties with them long ago  But still  Im miserable and sad probably because of my loneliness   Does therapy really work  Maybe I should go to one ,F30
It's exactly that  And I actually do believe in God  I believe he is the only one who can help me at this point  I just hope it won't take too long before I get help,F30
Thanks a lot  We'll give them a shout   I'm still trying to figure out what I would prefer the outcome to be   I'm a little concerned that being on disability could affect her motivation to try to do things ,F30
Not sure how to respond friendo ,F30
"I love it when I write something like ""not so great  you "" and they just write something like ""good  good   ""  You don't have to ask me why I'm not feeling good but don't rub your happiness in my face   ",F30
i love  this  https   open spotify com user tamilicon playlist 0HI61t5j8CqNNHPRDJIgob  playlist,F30
Good  that's a great song  positive  and I hope you feel better tonight ,F30
nice dude  pythong is a great place to start and c  is just good all round ,F30
I live in Canada  Im just curious of options out there ,F30
I had the Mirena for many years and am getting the Skyla soon  hopefully  the pharmacy is being super slow    I love IUDs so much   It doesn't mess with my mood  but you may find your period naturally upsets your mood ,F30
I have a copper IUD and would recommend it for everyone  It's non hormonal which is better for you  in my opinion   plus it's good for 10 years  ,F30
It was the best day of my life  and I did say that  Thanks for the advice   ,F30
Whatever you're going through right now  it will get better in time  Trust me  I've been there  And if you feel like talking  just post it here  We can all help you    ,F30
"Remember ""A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step""  Just don't give up ",F30
Wellbutrin does have slightly speedy effects  it could absolutely be causing your side effects  I would not suggest changing your dose until you can get a hold of your doctor  who should lower your dose or take you completely off it ,F30
This is great  I can relate how depression can stop you from doing things  so I'm proud of you  ,F30
Why is a little awkwardness and shyness seen as the worst thing ever  Like come on  I'll try and be be polite and nice  But nope  I guess being quiet is worse than murder ,F30
Oh my goodness     This is physical and emotional abuse  Please tell someone and don't believe anything these sick guys are telling you    I am so so so sorry this happened and believe me  it's not your fault ,F30
the tough years are stacking,F30
I don't know where to write it  but I accidentally created the same topic few times  aome net reaction problem ,F30
all I can handle lately is tycho hahaha ,F30
Like others have said  go ahead  just don't abuse it  Try not to smoke until you have finished everything you have to do for the day and then  you can relax and smoke ,F30
Also how do I tell her  that I like her  I wanna do it in person of course  but I am scared  that if she doesn't like me as well  she will feel awkward ,F30
Holy shit bro you just blew my mind  like I knew they were similar but wtf you just made them the SAME,F30
My wife is leaving me,F30
I'm just gonna wait it out  she seemed happy so I hope for the best,F30
You'll find something  I'm sure of it,F30
You can tell us Here,F30
Yes it is  the first two weeks of any type of anti depressant are hell  be patient   good luck  ,F30
You didn't give consent and or were incapable of giving consent  which legally constitutes rape  I hope you will call the police immediately to report this  ,F30
I find it beyond difficult to meet people  I've been told I seem cold and disinterested but it's more I don't know what to say and I stay very in control of my emotions so i don't really show much ,F30
Being around my family for the holidays is triggering  I slept with my highschool sweetheart  it's been ten years  and it was magical except that now he's distant  I feel all kinds of fucked up and lonely ,F30
I've only rung and got through to one once  She seems very disinterested and for some reason kept asking who else was with me  Which was no one as I was sat in a park alone at night ,F30
Been going like what I feel is depressed for several years now  never told anyone in my life   ,F30
i kill you then you kill me k   deal,F30
I understand how frustrating not being able to do anything about distance can be  but don't get too mad for something you can't change  at least yet  it will just get worse for nothing  I'll send you a message tomorrow for sure  ,F30
I've heard a lot of unfortunate things about it  too  Surprised it's workin for me  I'm thankful but  ya know  ,F30
Well I had and it was not really effective  at some point they were slightly less awful but since I have uni and a work besides it went back to the same  Thanks  I'll look at it ,F30
I think about suicide these days  It comforts me  ,F30
OH HELL TO THE YES APPETITE FOR DESTRUCTION IS THE BEST ALBUM EVER HANDS DOWN and it's   really   awesome to see another aspiring astrophysicist who likes the same music as me like dude we're practically best friends now ,F30
I wish I could relate to it ,F30
Chalk it up to last year  That's fu   sorry to hear ,F30
Me too  Makes me feel like I'm a failure at real life  As in I'm too weak to get along with the real world so I look for an escape  And all the thing I dream of are practically impossible  ,F30
everyone in this thread seems to feel better after a good dose of rock and metal and it makes me live honestly  it's good to see a bunch of people with the same music taste as me around you know ,F30
i don't listen to ambient but this just made me want to give this genre a try  who knows it might be just what i need  i'll check out all these artists and maybe give a little update if i get into them,F30
everyone could use some classical music sometime  good choice imo,F30
it says not available  can you try another link ,F30
i just checked it out  it's definitely going in my playlist now ,F30
Kinda like hugging the pillow at night  mimicking her presence and then later crushing it towards your body  sobbing and crying because it's not real  Yeah  ,F30
Happy Birthday    I felt pretty down on my birthday too  I just turned 19 and Suicide doesn't seem so bad after all ,F30
"I just turned 19  my ""friends"" are also fed up with me and my mental illness  I don't know what to do anymore  all I could do is cry myself to sleep  smoke some good weed  and repeat ",F30
Have a wonderful womb exodus reminiscence day ,F30
I see it as it takes more effort to get to know someone shy or awkward  There's so many other people who are able to connect with others right away so it's not always worth the time to try to force someone open ,F30
You can tell a therapist absolutely anything and not worry about them being able to take it  ,F30
Woo keep it up  try to aim for an extra 2 each week    always slowly but surely ,F30
I'm sorry    If you ever want to talk to a stranger I'm here  I wish I could smoke some goddamn weed  medication has ruined that for me haa,F30
Happy Birthday   Try find the tiny positive in the day  that helps me ,F30
Happy Birthday   Mine is coming up pretty quick  Gonna be another day where nothing happens  ,F30
I wanna be happy ,F30
I do  I get constant feelings of longing and just    can't get it out of my head  Drawing helps me   ,F30
"If you're bad at ""chatting up girls"" and only of average hotness  you will likely never get someone who is interested",F30
It's settled  what grade are you in right now  and do you play any instruments yourself  ,F30
Indeed  Two and a half years here  and still counting    ,F30
i'm in tenth grade and majoring in programming  its not as fancy as it sounds i'm not a genius lmao  and i play guitar i guess but i'm no jimmy page ,F30
I'm sorry you're feeling this way  I just turned 19  been through 8 Electroconvulsive Therapy Procedures  been prescribed meds and nothing worked  I never had a girl attracted to me  ever  ,F30
I can't even begin to imagine how you're feeling   I'm so terribly sorry  Stay strong  and be strong for your father and sister  they will need it  ,F30
I've been through 8 Electroconvulsive Therapy Procedures and nothing has helped me ,F30
c a l l   t h e   p o l i c e   Don't let those rapists and bullies get away with it and make you feel as if it was your fault  ,F30
No  you're not a slut or any of the other negative things they called you  Report them to the police because not only did they rape you  but they obviously assaulted a minor  I'm sorry    ,F30
As much as you feel down  you need to call the police as soon as you can ,F30
Feelin' like crap  I don't have any friends in real life and this constant silence and loneliness is killing me from inside out ,F30
Fu k   is as if I was reading my own words   Would love to give you a hug  man   ,F30
A simple 'I don't feel too good these days' sounds like it might get the job done  Or maybe 'I'm feeling down and pretty bad about myself right now'  Simple   but gets the job done ,F30
Listen to this person as well  If you feel like you need to talk to someone  there's nothing wrong with seeking help from a therapist despite the seemingly negative stigma  It's perfectly normal to talk to a therapist  and they're there to help you ,F30
Continuing to live is not a weakness  Staying alive takes effort  Every day   ,F30
Yes  Keep going  You've started  and that's the hardest part  ,F30
Hey  would you be willing to keep talking about it  What are you testing for    ,F30
Happy birthday   ,F30
Depends on the meds  Talk to your doc,F30
God damn  this is dramatic af  ,F30
I'm sorry  Message me if you'd like to talk ,F30
 Anything off this playlist I made  https   www youtube com playlist list PLl7XKKbkBsVgZoxBM6eLSoXkfj9iZx Cc   The stories in the songs are so immersive and distracting  and the songs are so beautiful  ,F30
Weird  it works for me  Try this   https   www youtube com watch v LqUFMZcatEQ,F30
Thanks  I have to check out that movie   I'm not saying I will be an amazing drummer  but I know I'm capable   It would be an absolute waste not to persue it further especially when I enjoy it so much ,F30
this makes a ton of sense  thanks for getting back to me  I'll try to reach out to him more when I can  Hopefully I can get him to see a specialist rather than a psychologist  that way he can get diagnosed ,F30
If you are a software developer why don't you start trying to work remotely  you can travel the world with you laptop and work at the same time  Aren't there a decent amount of developers that do this sort of thing ,F30
I'd get a second opinion  University doctors will be used to students coming to see them and trying to get medical excuses for things  Can you see a non university doctor ,F30
Im gonna think about it tomorrow and try to make up my mind  Thank you,F30
PM me if you need to talk to someone ,F30
I suppose something that's more like a day to day thing  Something that could make me feel like I'm leading a satisfying life  ,F30
This is why we need basic income ,F30
Do not contact him  He is harrassing  bullying and abusing you  They are responsible for their actions  and their actions are appalling  Can you call a rape hotline  I can find you a number  hold on ,F30
Thanks for the feedback  I'll try it out,F30
Every survivor wants an answer to this question  But there really are no answers  You'll drive yourself crazy trying to find out 'why'  Maybe there is no reason  they might not even know why they did it  ,F30
  Well   I guess I have    But  as you can tell  it only means letting someone close so they can hurt you more    ,F30
OP here is a link to resources please call them   They have free couseling services and support groups as well as a hotline    https   centers rainn org,F30
If I could manage to have nice dreams every night  almost half of my life would be awesome   D,F30
I'm in such a state that meeting with friends is hard  Forget about strangers ,F30
oh hey that's cool as hell  D ,F30
He'll fuck up eventually  They always do ,F30
You are not a slut  They unfairly took advantage with you and should be prosecuted as adults for rape  Feel better ,F30
I get this feeling all of the time and I only work part time right now  I hope I can find a job that is tolerable and doesn't make me just want to stay at home and do nothing all of the time ,F30
Please call the police and give them every name and address of these guys  they raped you and deserve to go to jail ,F30
This was not your fault they are bad people  ,F30
It's so scary to think how short our lives are  and how much time we waste on work  and other things we hate  Seriously makes me envy hobos lol,F30
Please don't do it  I just read a comment from you helping others and teaching them that life is worth living don't do it  3 we got you ,F30
I'm shooting myself before my next birthday  Happy Birthday  ,F30
This is EXACTLY how I am feeling lately  I feel like I just woke up from autopilot mode from the last 10 years  I have no idea how to lead my life moving forward or why I am doing what I am doing now  ,F30
Humans are hardwired for social hierarchy  but some are not  It's ok if you aren't  fuck them  Seek comfort and friendliness elsewhere  Your cat is a great place to start     ,F30
"You know as Mark Twain said  ""The more I learn about people  the more I like my dog "" Yup  fuck humans ",F30
EXACTLY how I am feeling  Absolutely dredding work tomorrow  ,F30
Make it a game  The longer you can stay alive  the more points you are rewarded  The more points you are rewarded  the closer you are to beating the battle against depression and suicide  Stay strong ,F30
Your opinion is not needed here  Please leave OP alone ,F30
To reiterate what others are saying   it doesn't matter what you were wearing  They raped you  You have zero blame ,F30
That's all depression is  one never ending internal scream    I hope you manage to heal your pain  ,F30
Are you sure you're not still slightly hypomanic and too optimistic about thinking you can afford it   If you can still return it  I would return it and stick with the original plan ,F30
You're just 15  They clearly abused you  tell your parents and call the police ,F30
If what you've said is true  then these fuckers belong behind bars  I'm sorry this happened to you  Tell the police  a teacher  your parents  somebody about this ,F30
I feel you dude    ,F30
Yeah  though just the last few months for me after separating from my family  I still can't figure out how to get over losing that much  even if they weren't good for me ,F30
You're not a slut  They raped you  Contact the police ASAP ,F30
I did the same  but I was home alone  fun    but it felt 10x better than going out and having to fake being happy about another 4 digit number that contains  365 days  Maybe I'm used to it now ,F30
Not really  but ouch that sounds like it hurts    ,F30
Sounds familiar    Do your best to get out of your shell  be brave  be persistent and if nothing works  and you see no hope  move somewhere else  and start a new life ,F30
It's even worse if you aren't caring  helpful  sincere or hard working ,F30
Thanks for the advice  it's nice to know I'm not the only one ,F30
Damn  man    I hope things keep going well ,F30
THIS  Holy shit  this   Nobody gives a fuck about wanting to connect anymore ,F30
It's hard for me  because to a extent  it causes bad anxiety  I've tried several things to make it bearable but now it is mostly just the mental connection to the anxiety  rather than the anxiety  ,F30
Whatever responsibilities are overdue have to wait until you're better   Have you let anyone in your life know how badly off you are   Is there someone you can talk to   Please get help and drop everything else until you've found some ,F30
That's fucking disgusting  I hope the lady feels ashamed  They're dealing with people who are about to take their life and then they just neglect the person and make them feel worse  What a shitty excuse of a human being ,F30
That's something I plan to do on my next birthdays  Spending it with a whole lot of people that pretend to care is suffocating ,F30
Okay  How's their relationship with the person ,F30
"This is a pretty good way to put it  I wonder whats making us smell the roses  Its inevitable that things will change if you continue to maintain that attitude about ""wanting to shine' fuck yeah dude ",F30
You need to see someone different  Not everyone understands  even if they're educated and should know better  ,F30
Could you teach languages to other people  Or even try teaching English abroad because you have a desire to travel ,F30
Don't rely on women for happiness  It won't end well  ,F30
Ok i understand what you mean    i will try to do what you suggested  Thank you very much ,F30
You might try volunteering somewhere   like Habitat for Humanity or an animal shelter or something like that ,F30
Noone can say  Shrooms might give you 1 week's remission  or 3 months  Or they wont work at all  Or ketamine will do it  Only way to find out is to experiment ,F30
Thank you so much  I will try this tonight,F30
He is dead so hopefully not that good ,F30
It has it's hits and misses  It's been on for a while so there is plenty of material to check out  ,F30
Okay  I understand  If you feel that your life is better once you get life insurance  will you still go through with your plan ,F30
I'm on 60mg of Cymbalta and crying is difficult  I was at 120mg for awhile and crying was impossible for me  That being said  I think everyone's experience is different  Lots of variables  ,F30
Call the police  Get help  Get tested for STDs  Tell your parents  You are not gross  ugly  fat or a slut and you are definitely not alone in this  We are here for you ,F30
Yep I've tried the whole human support thing  and this is working out a whole lot better     ,F30
Horrible people did horrible things to you and they said horrible things  Go to the hospital  call the police  and don't listen to a word they said ,F30
Oh  one thing to ask about is if your doctor uses anesthetic when inserting  Some do and some don't  I've never had kids and it was pretty okay without the anesthetic  but some people faint and have a lower pain tolerance  ,F30
I'm really glad it helped this has made my day so thank you  3    If you have any sons daughters they would be distraught to see you go as you would be a massive part of their lives  Your in my prayers  lt 3,F30
I know exactly how you feel  I'm the same  maybe we can help each other  how about a chat ,F30
I understand  It can be very difficult to try to reach out to someone and talk  especially for those of us with depression  Do you have any friends that you talk to about your feelings  ,F30
Im a sophomore they were seniors we went to school together,F30
That's not dumb at all   That actually made me laugh too haha  ,F30
All I can picture is my sister doing this  She used to accidentally start fires with the microwave all the damn time lmao  ,F30
Ayy  I wanna help too ,F30
lexapro will give similar feelings of numbness   i have no experience in taking it but i work in a pharmacy as a tech so theres that    ,F30
Haha I can relate so much  I am always the initiator of any text  If I don't then it's just back to loneliness town  ,F30
ayy 2's good but 3's better  ,F30
If you take lamictal be careful because the Mirena IUD changes your estrogen levels which changes the way your body absorbs lamictal  I didn't know this and it caused a lot of problems ,F30
Have you talked to adults or to the police  If not  do so now ,F30
Not entirely unrelated  where does one find access to gymnast type equipment like the hanging rings etc nowadays  Maybe just university athletic departments I'm thinking ,F30
I'm on Lexapro now   I don't feel much in the way of side effects aside from low libido ,F30
Good for you  It takes real strength to take that important step  Let us know how it goes with your doc ,F30
Just seeing your response  so checking in     How are things now  ,F30
Lots of young people have a hard time with this  Do you have a therapist  Are there any types of jobs that interest you ,F30
Ah  my bad  Yeah I completely agree with you  People like that are serious asses ,F30
Make that 4  3,F30
Late night solo movies can be awesome  Movie was great btw ,F30
Taking curcumin with Bromelain improves its uptake  ,F30
Greetings  Please don't let my name scare you ,F30
What's your new years resolution  ,F30
I'm glad to hear  Stay strong   D,F30
Do the parents know that she has these medically diagnosed conditions  Depressed people can be really good at hiding or minimizing these things and that leaves the parents not knowing the reasons for behavior ,F30
Nah  man  you don't deserve that  I know the feeling though  Hang in there  ,F30
If you need an ear  I can listen,F30
Finally the holiday season is over  I don't have to pretend that I am happy anymore ,F30
I think having a pet is  always  a great idea  but I hope you do get that dog at some point  even if not now ,F30
Mmm I don't know what to comment  Your feelings are very understandable if I was in your situation I don't think I could do better  ,F30
Awwww  Sounds like you have a grumpy one  I promise all the cats I've had have at least not hissed at me  Dogs are generally good tempered but cats get a bad reputation because of the ones that get real cranky,F30
I think you just discovered Existentialism    So go ahead and decide for yourself what life is about ,F30
Do you think people in an alternate world dream about being us ,F30
Sometimes it really is chemical  My psychiatrist has worked wonders ,F30
Ooh  yeah  seroquel is nasty stuff  S,F30
Yeah that's a bummer  Things only get more awkward when you try to force yourself to talk either  I'm not trying to make light of your situation  but it's too bad they can't let you be the quiet friend like Silent Bob  ,F30
Damn  this describes the dynamic of every single friend group I've had  Unfortunately I don't have any friends now  so maybe I got too awkward and sad for anyone to want to be friends with me  ,F30
They know  they just think its all a bunch of bs,F30
The only way you could know if you have depression is to go to therapy  I encourage you to do It ,F30
I think you might have misinterpreted the situation  they might have just said what they were saying in a tone of voice that made it seem like they were angry even though they weren't ,F30
I'm on Mirena and haven't had a period since getting it inserted  Could be the IUD or could be the AP I've been taking  My mood has had no change though ,F30
Yes  I am angered at the fact that they took it so lightly in prescribing it  to someone so young  and without a diagnosis ,F30
I've been rolling around in this existential muck for years now  I suppose this post of mine is a breakdown of what it meant to me   Life is still meaningless to me   ,F30
How is 'now' related to 'forever'   Pointless to search for a point because there is none objectively  therefore meaningless ,F30
Holy shit man  you're a fucking wizard  What did you say when you did start talking to her  You must have been bricking it on that first date ,F30
    Ayy but that poem was nice  mister or miss   Just wanted to let you know that   ,F30
If that's not rape then I don't know what is  Go to the police asap  Don't let them get away with this or they might do it someone else  ,F30
Could you try writing it down and giving it to them ,F30
Where do you live  Sorry to be so personal  but here in Northern Europe 'cold and disinterested' is the norm and much more acceptable  than friendlier climates   Perhaps you'd do better with people more like yourself ,F30
don't ever try to impress anyone but yourself ,F30
I havent got a reccomendations for an app if you are looking for it  But i have my own reward systems  It involves popsicles for the smaller tasks like vacuuming and it involves lazy days for the days after my quarterly spring winter autumn summer cleaning  ,F30
"I just say ""Good "" I don't think it's inaccurate to say it's just a way of saying Hello that has the illusion of being friendlier or more informal  The expectation is that everyone involved says they are ""Good """,F30
Do this all the time  I'm the complete opposite person of who I really am  ,F30
Thank you for sharing your story  Someday we will all be okay  ,F30
That sounds familiar  Was it in a book ,F30
I'm here if you want to talk  Send me a pm whenever you like ,F30
from your description it sounds like they had sex with you against your will  which is rape absolutely  I'm sorry that happened to you  nobody deserves that  ,F30
Tell me what movie you are going to watch  I have no friends either lol  I'll go watch it too so it's like you have a friend with you    ,F30
Haha  I do the same  I dunno  I just felt like it was likely we may be from the same part of the internet  How bout that  I wonder if we've even stumbled across each other before ,F30
To me  the holiday season is over  and it's time for me to pretend that I am happy again,F30
At least something makes you happy,F30
Ehh  thats normal to a large degree for some folks  You have Reddit and it's 24 7    So how was your day ,F30
Eventually I run out of things to browse     Reddit is my getaway most of the time when I'm feeling down and alone My day was okay  I'm alive    how about yours  ,F30
Sex drive went way down for the first year  Appetite through the roof for the first year  Both stabilized themselves for the most part  although I still suspect that both are out of whack still   ,F30
Yeah I don't feel sad just tired and foggy ,F30

I feel like asides from being awkward  looks have a lot to do with it I'm not good looking  therefore many people don't really look to talk to me whatsoever  In turn  I just get more and more awkward with time  ,F30
Keep trying  do you have a soundcloud  I make music too I want to hear your work,F30
The craziest thing is  in all the successful relationships i know  the guy cheated on the female but they still have way more successful of a relationship than i ever will ,F30
thanks    this helped a lot  Looks like I should to CBT first to build a foundation and then attempt DBT next ,F30
You should go to the hospital and tell them what happened  What someone else does to you is not your fault ,F30
Same  it really sucks being alone  If you want we can talk about it  Message me in pms if you want ,F30
Really  you only need to be good at meeting one stranger  It's got at least as much to do with luck as it does skill ,F30
So post here  Plenty of folks listening  It helps to vent sometimes ,F30
I like to drink ginger ale when I have an upset stomach  especially hangovers  The ginger helps  and the carbonation does  too ,F30
This sounds like rape  You need to see a doctor ,F30

Okay  If you're going to do that can you talk to me first  ,F30
No problem man  sometimes you need to make light in a bad situation ,F30

https   soundcloud com hacker logic  Still learning the ropes  but I'm getting there ,F30
i love love  i feel its one of the only things i have anymore that i know will give me some happiness,F30
I'm a bit confused  Are you trying to say something about inflammation  or are you trying to say something about acetylcholinesterase  You haven't established that there's any sort of relationship between the two with the research cited in your OP ,F30
No wizard here  Just learned to use the Internet as a shield  My issue is I suck at making conversation   If asked direct questions then I am fine   I guess I just went into it not expecting anything  ,F30
You did it  Every little bit counts  Keep at it bud ,F30
I'll be your friend  ,F30
I get headahces from resting my head all day  where you crying laying down  Also what did they told yoy  ,F30

Go to the hospital they will give you a test to collect dna that may be left behind from the rapists and they can call the police for you ,F30
Yes they are  I'm going to chat with my psych about how I can manage it because unfortunately it is causing my old eating disorder to rear its ugly head ,F30
Its kind of comforting to know I'm not alone in these feelings its also upsetting knowing others feel similar  I'm sorry ,F30
Based on your post description  you didn't set out looking for sex with someone  let alone everyone else  Please tell someone ,F30
That's really cool actually  I've been through a few accounts but I'm finally situated in one I plan on staying at  In all honesty I think it'd be cool to help support your art  It'd be crazy if we'd crossed paths before ,F30
thank you so much man  if you ever need somebody to talk to hit me up cause you restored my hope,F30
no  none of this is your fault  i'm so sorry you had to deal with this  please please please tell someone you know in real life ,F30

ya that hits me really deep   ,F30
"""Doomed"" is a big  permanent sounding word  Meeting people is just a skill like any other    Improvement comes with practice  practice  practice  You're not doomed  ",F30
I wouldn't want to hurt OP if everything they've said is true  Even if there was sufficient evidence  which I am not finding  it's not worth the risk to me ,F30
its whatever man  good luck ,F30
I will too  ,F30
i dont even know what to say  this story is crazy  its crazy that youre still with us  youre amazing,F30
Aww I'm sorry to remind you of that  Well I would suggest some sort of excercise to get move some of the blood from your head  Running is good walking too any excercise really  ,F30
If you doubt a post is on the up and up  please bring it up to the mod team and we will take a look  It is completely inappropriate to accuse an OP of lying in this manner ,F30
Well I imagine a lot of people here are royalty,F30
This  Get help  my friend  Take care of yourself first  Everything else can wait ,F30
Nearly _ of humanity lives on less than  2 50 a day  If you live in an advanced country  even a poor existence is far better than the average,F30
Thank you  that's very kind  I definitely will   ,F30
And you feel awful for complaining because people don't understand that you can't tell your mind to stop hating you       ,F30
"Exactly   I'm at my lowest on the ""fun"" days where I'm out with friends  Makes no sense but that's life  Well  my life at least ",F30
20  no positive qualities either  going for the long haul,F30
Yeah  it's hard to make friends    hey  no problem though  I'm glad it meant something  And I hope things start improving for you    ,F30
If you want to get off meds you should seriously talk to your doctor  ,F30
More than most can do  myself included     Keep up the good work ,F30
I cant even do one correctly honestly  good for you  D,F30
Always do this  i usually imagine myself as a completely different person  ,F30
 Don't know compassion pit but my best guess is it's like blahtherapy or 7cups  check those  ,F30
Wooooooaw this isn't your fault at all and this is absolutely not ok  They got you drunk and physically held you    how can you even consider it is your fault    these peoples are bastards  Go to the hospital  please ,F30
What job do you do     let's talk,F30
unfortunately it really doesnt matter since my father has the last word  cannot wait to move out  whenever that is,F30
My roommate has left them out that long multiple times  It got so bad that we just switched to paper plates and plastic utensils ,F30
i think it was cool of you to get it all out  i dont think the journey can end here though,F30
If you need to talk  pm me or reply here      if you would like    I'd love to listen,F30
This is exactly how I feel  And the worst part is when she randomly texted me saying she doesn't want me in her life anymore and that she was only my friend cuz she felt sorry for me  Sigh  ,F30
Please  i know this is late but please go look for some kind of help  If you can PM me man  just need to know youre okay,F30
yeah  giving up and getting hard is all too associated with drawing  just feeding into my already breeding negativity  considering just deleting my tumblr so i can walk away,F30
I mean  I can't draw a straight line so you can't be this bad at drawing  Drawing seems like a really fun skill to learn  and I hope you end up finding your own art style  whatever it may be ,F30
Thank you that helps  Just walking around make my head feel a little better ,F30
i dont think im bad  but i think im painfully mediocre  everything i do is worth a good scroll while on your way to better  more pleasant art  im the filler space   thanks though ,F30
I intend on just killing my self I give up I can't take 23 years of hell anymore ,F30
I give up I can't take 23 years of hell and selfishness anymore ,F30
I feel like things can get better but it won't ever be fixed ,F30
can I see anything you've drawn ,F30
i promised myself that if i made this thread that i wouldnt post any art because i dont want pity points or anything    trust me  its just painfully mediocre  not bad  not good at all,F30
I'm just going to end it I'm tired trying ,F30
Sometimes I just need to vent    And hearing other peoples stories  makes me feel less alone in my fight and allows me to gain alternate views with which to view my life from ,F30
i dont know how to relate  why are you disgusted by people ,F30
Shitty honestly  like everyday tbh  Could care less though  kind of in that state where im just kinda numb to the feeling,F30
Have you got any examples of your work  I'm sure you're better than 90  of people heh ,F30
I have never had a sex drive ,F30
see my other response  im sorry  please trust my mediocrity and inability,F30
Fixed as in no more depression   I feel like that's just a healthy way of thinking about it but ultimately things still won't get completely better  Thanks though,F30
I don't even know what my goal is to be honest ,F30
Send me a PM with work  Can you draw animal skeletons  I'm looking for people to design tats for me ,F30
I used to draw a lot when I was younger I was good  now I fucking suck ,F30
I'd be happy to make a new friend     I'm currently in a voluntary psych ward and hope to meet and talk to some good professionals tomorrow who will help get me back on track too   message me please   ,F30
i m really sorry   hope you can process grief in a healthy way  my father died few years ago and i still havent processed tht  ,F30
It's not your fault  You did nothing wrong  Your brain just decided on it own that it was going to be sad  You have no control over this choice you brain made  You and your brain a different not literally but metaphorically ,F30
Yeah  rapists say that sort of thing ,F30
I don't need some one to jsjt say they care I need somebody who actually does care about how I feel and my situation I appreciate it if you do and or either way but I really can't take it anymore ,F30
You were raped  This is pretty clear cut ,F30
Good luck  Let me know if you need anything at all in deciding anything  I think both are super helpful for different reasons but I'd start with CBT first   3 ,F30
Your welcome   ,F30
Even better  skype screenshare some netflix ,F30
Call for help  Please  There's still a lot to do  and you need to be there  Hope you're okay   3,F30
Me too  although sometimes he's a unwilling companion  whenever I hug the guy my days are a little less gloomier ,F30
I find its good to write stuff down when im emotional  ,F30
I'm about to graduate soon  had an internship where I worked hard and was well received  but i hated it and everyone there  Idk  I feel very lost  ,F30
That's exactly how I feel I want to stay positive and do better but low self esteem and social anxiety simply kill it for me,F30
But then you realize that it will probably never happen  as is the reality for most people  ,F30
That makes me cringe ,F30
Thank you   ,F30
I don't have any friends  I drifted away from them  They all have lots of friends and I don't really matter  I don't think I will ever have friends again  I'm too shy to make new friends  I wish I had friends too  ,F30
One thought  and depends on if you have time  is to help donate time volunteer at a local shelter aspca  you may not be able to take the animals home  but will allow you to get some time with a dog cat   ,F30
got the copper IUD  no hormones   no risk for higher rates of depression  mood changes  appetite changes etc the cramps are tough but its worth it ,F30
My cats one of my best friends  he's 14  so we've been through the worst together  ,F30
Orange cats   best cats  I'm a crazy cat man at 21 already and would have completely given up without kitty  We lay on the floor yesterday together for an hour or so  he was just purring gently  3,F30
This is rape  Nothing else but it  Contact the police  go to the hospital  Tell your parents  You are loved  it isnt your fault  Be strong,F30
Agreed  doesnt even seem like theres room for guess work ,F30
Holy shit man  This sounds pretty god damn terrible  Really aren't words to express it or the sorrow we feel for you ,F30
One day at a time  It is an applicable and great thing to remember  Hugs to you OP  Big problems are not as big as they seem  just break them down into manageable chunks  ,F30
I feel the same way  I wish I could enjoy my youth but I can't  Everyone else my age is living it up and making memories  I don't think things will get better for me  but I hope they get better for you ,F30
One day at a time won't work so well in two days when everything comes crashing down on top of me  ,F30
Definitely  My dogs are the best thing that's happened to me  ,F30
I love philosophy too  but ain't a fan of reading    I have a novel that I want to share with the world someday  I'm still working on it  292 pages into it now  87k word count ,F30
I'd rather fail knowing I tried  Nobody got to where they are today by being a pessimist  ,F30
What were they and dose  If you feel ill go to hospital ,F30
Add me for some overwatch tomorrow  Mrtembo 1354     ,F30
Yes that's what goes through my mind as well  Like I don't deserve it  Or like they are only doing it because they have to which makes me push them away even more  Then after that I feel guilty for possibly hurting them   ,F30
Yeah I hear you  I wish I had the same drive  Gl,F30
Yeah  no kidding  You go to the trouble of putting yourself out there and they just pretend you don't exist  Fuck'em ,F30
Ride the storm  Sounds terrible but one day you'll thank me for this  Just keep that in your head  One day the storm will be over,F30
Is there any evidence that increased acetylcholine is associated with depression   By evidence I mean scientific studies  not anecdotes  ,F30
Only if you are male ,F30
Yup  Women live on easy mode ,F30
Good luck  I wish for your peace  dead or alive ,F30
Sure thing  I added ya,F30
I know this is a weird question  but how much sleep do you get  Also  do you feel your thoughts racing ,F30
The way you feel about drawing is the way I feel about writing  especially when I read how excellent people my age  older and younger too   are compared to me ,F30
Absolutely no one  Except one person at work  ,F30
I know what you mean  The last 6 years of my life felt like someone else was controlling me and now I'm just waking up and having to live in the mess they created   ,F30
That's a very good question  one that I often ponder the answer to  I often think if I was stupid and a bit of a gullible idiot  would I be so sad  Interesting point though  nice to know I am not the only one ,F30
Hello friend  want to talk  What happened ,F30
Did anything happen in your life that seemed to trigger it ,F30
   good    What kind of character and campaign are you playing  Are you a player character or the DM ,F30
Try deactivating facebook  its a subconscious mindfuck that can make you depressed ,F30
Yes  They actually have made really weighed blankets for anxiety and depression for this reason   ,F30
Hello friend  sorry to hear you're having a hard time    What kind of job do you have now  What's your living situation ,F30
Just had this happen  water helped  Caffeine helped a bit  Sleep cured it  but then its a new day to get a headache ,F30
I like to think that I am a realist aware  but I'm probably just depressed as shit    It's probably both to some degree  ,F30
What exactly should one practice though  I have attempted to initiate small talk with both male and female  and people literally speak their last words while running away from me ,F30
lol awkward girls are deemed cute and playful  Awkward guys are deemed weak ,F30
If its a combination of antidepressants or extremely high dose you could have serotonin sickness  this is no joke  Very dangerous call someone ,F30
That is most definitely rape call the police and tell your parents,F30
We're terribly sorry for your loss  but this belongs in  r SuicideBereavement rather than here   ,F30
This was such a lovely kind hearted post  i'd really like to know what rule was broken  c,F30
 unless they're considered ugly,F30
Ugly women have choices of men after them  including attractive men  just less of them than average or above women   They choose their loneliness ,F30
I didn't know about that sub  thanks ,F30
It explain why I never got the happit of brushing teeth ,F30
Just installed the app  it's great   Thanks,F30
Playing a Goliath paladin and we are playing the elemental evil campaign ,F30
Most definitely you have to go to the hospital  contact your parents and the police  You might say you feel confused or scared but in no question you're not at fault  ,F30
What you described is rape  ,F30
Huh    that's interesting  Sounds a little similar to my situation  Might take a look into that group  p ,F30
 ORLY   http   2damnfunny com wp content uploads 2014 03 Louis C K  On Men Being The Number One Threat To Women Since The Dawn Of Time jpg ,F30
You are a sovereign consciousness who has every right to exist  If others try to make you think otherwise  berate you  degrade you  they are wrong  Not you ,F30
Women choose that by going out with abusive alpha males  ,F30
Not a slut  You were raped  Go make a police report please ,F30
Thanks for the hope  Glad to hear you are out the rabbit hole ,F30
That's not true      ,F30
I guess it depends on the medication and the dosage  I've used three different antidepressants and I never struggled with not being able to cry or express emotions  ,F30
Fuck your family  Religion is no excuse to shun family    Never undervalue your brother  him standing up for you is brave of him ,F30
haHAA ty  Im one of the only girls who actually hates playing support lol  It's just not fun to me  But hey  at least i get to stream as well so perks  P,F30
Yeah I've had similar thoughts dreams before   I see them mourning over my dead body broken in tears for days  and a week later I'm almost forgotten  another week or two and I'm rarely remembered  ,F30
The only way to fix depression would be to remove the emotion  the hurt    and we need that  The best thing is to find balance    peace   ,F30
I feel guilt   not because everything they try to do for me or give but just because it seems like I don't deserve what they offer   if that makes sense ,F30
I got led on twice in the same way    And now I just keep getting rejected ,F30
Absolutely tell your parents  I let it slip one day and I thought it was the worst day of my life  but now I'm getting help ,F30
Exactly  give them all the help in the world take your advice proceed to throw it in the bin and will only you message you with more bullshit problems,F30
If you are an attractive woman you aren't doomed to be alone  regardless of how bad your depression is  Even if you have no will to socialize you can still find someone  That's not the case for males ,F30
You were raped  and it was ENTIRELY NOT your fault  NOTHING you did makes it your fault  You were drunk and COULD NOT consent  Go to the police now and report them ,F30
this exact thing happened to me too and it fucking sucks  I'm so sorry they did this to you  its the worst feeling ,F30
I went to one for years and it really helped me    it's ok    truly  it's ok,F30
I mainly write about whatever is on my mind at the time   It could literally be anything   They often don't make much sense  but I try to make them into something interesting   At least  I try to do that anyway ,F30
Hey friend  thanks for this  Any advice on how to induce crying  I feel sad but also emotionally constipated  Thanks,F30
no problem man  feel free to pm me too  but im going to bed right now so ill get back to you in like 12 hours  you can litterally pm anything  idgaf ,F30
I know   at first it really helped but I had allergic reaction to the only medicine that helped me  ,F30
Me too Just try to live through and don't do stupid shit and focus on your studies that way you will succeed,F30
keep writing  a vent is a vent  So dont be too critical about the output  feel free to share it with reddit when your comfortable with feedback,F30
You can be lonely in a relationship  you can't be alone and being alone is worse  At least in the situation OP is talking about  doomed to be alone   involuntarily being alone for a long time  forever ,F30
Yes I find it rather annoying ,F30
Don't EVER let a woman  or any human being for that matter  control your emotional frame of mind ,F30
I just looked into this  I never knew it was actually something   I thought it was just an active imagination    Thanks for sharing this with everyone  ,F30
Everyone I talked to who had it said they lost at LEAST 5 pounds in the first few weeks going off of it  I'm scared I'm stuck at this weight and am going to have to work super hard to get it off now     ,F30
This was beautiful and very relatable ,F30
I agree with these posts  you were taken advantage of  Its gonna be a tough pill to swallow so go easy on yourself  Go easy on yourself and speak with the police and speak with some loved ones  ,F30
It's so good that you're coming out the other side  but I understand your fear  It's a big change  It's definitely a good thing  but your mind may take a while to figure that out  Stick with it and keep on climbing ,F30
Yeah  but it's weird how it's different with other people  like I still remember a bomb ass hug I got from a guy friend that was honestly like the best thing ever,F30
Go to the police right away  Be strong  ,F30
Please be safe and take care of yourself  Make sure you have people around you that can take care of you,F30
I stay the fuck away from it  Can't get out of my head when I'm high ,F30
Maaan  I didn't lose my virginity til like 21  I don't think it's anything to be ashamed of   And generally  I feel you  I'd like to have people in my life for every reason you listed too ,F30
Hopefully it works out   Brush it off if it doesn't   Best of luck man ,F30
Wow  That's a big dose when considering the Wellbutrin and Adderall dosage together ,F30
You got this  ,F30
Why you hate us ,F30
Man  Well  I'm a woman and I know you're not trash  for what it's worth  Rejection hurts   I was turned down a couple months ago  too ,F30
Well  you posted that here  I am proud of you for that  ,F30
I know that feel  my dad died the same way   he was ok  and the next day he was dead  Time heals  it will get better  just pray for her and for yourself  ,F30
That was a rape  tell your parents now ,F30
I've trained myself to answer insome rehearsed tone or something just so no one asks anything,F30
Not a snowballs chance in hell  Had it for too long ,F30
Dude that's not funny  ,F30
This is how I feel about every hobby or skill I've tried my hand at so far in life  including drawing ,F30
Not everyone is comfortable talking on the phones for long periods of time,F30
The community is here for you  You're not alone,F30
Go to the police immediately  Stay safe ,F30
Should I call her tomorrow  If she doesn't answer leave a voicemail  What would you do if you were in her situation ,F30
Couldn't you just hide that you don't belive in god  ,F30
Go for it  Ive begun my process as well and it feels amazing to finally work towards being alive and well ,F30
Time to get help ,F30
Ich lernst Deutsch  The more I try fix the depression the more miserable I feel ,F30
It gives me an appetite  I swear I'd go days without eating more than a few crackers if I didn't use a little at meal times  ,F30
We forgive you  All of us  It's not your fault that society aestheticizes mental illnesses and sweeps their devastating reality beneath the carpet  It truly is something one needs to experience before understanding ,F30
Wishing you the best   ,F30
"Last night I watched The Amazing Spiderman 2 out of sheer boredom  The ending conveyed perhaps one of the most clichd motivational messages in the world  ""keep fighting ""   but goddamit if it didn't strike a chord deep within me ",F30
And oops    it's sprichst  not spricht    I guess I just really love that letter ,F30
Please don't do this  Direct your frustration towards something less harmful ,F30
Sorry to you and your family for your loss  Cant imagine how muc pain it would feel  Hope you can in good time continue to make the progress you recently had  in good time ,F30
Good on you for making the decision  Best of luck,F30
Drawing is one of the hardest hobbies to feel satisfied with because it takes years to actually get good at and progress can feel slow which leads to frustration  I like drawing but it can be so stressful ,F30
I will try my hardest to become successful and overcome my disadvantages  I think that my pain is a part of my motivation,F30
Dont worry about others  Focus on what you want to achieve  Hope you reach your goals,F30
Oh that's awful  I'm so sorry  Losing a family member early is never easy,F30
Hey want to talk  Feel free to message me  I think we can help each other ,F30
I think of it as righteous vengeance  Well  to an onlooker it might seem silly but it really gives me the jollies   If they want to attack me  they should be prepared for the consequences   Edit  How is this harmful ,F30
I don't or ever smoked regularly  Last time I got paranoid and I could only wait for it to pass  Terrible experience  never again ,F30
Id say Headspace or Calm,F40
Thank you  and thank you for taking the time to share your personal experience  It made me feel less apprehensive about taking meds  ,F40
Ask your doctor if Prozac is right for you ,F40
Doing the things that give me anxiety  It sucks  but i just do it  Its getting better now  ,F40
Thanks    ,F40
Yes this happens to me too  I will wake up from it with my heart racing and be choking for breath  ,F40
Thank you for that information  I appreciate your response  ,F40
take a break from chocking the chicken,F40
Feel free to PM me if you want someone to talk to    3 ,F40
I've always had sleep problems with SSRIs  Also never had vivid nightmares until SSRIs too ,F40
I made it out today btw  ,F40
I really appreciate that  sorry for just now responding  I will definitely take you up on the offer ,F40
I had this when I was around 10 years old it creeped the fuck out of me but eventually I got used to it and learned to cope with it  I'm sure it'll pass just like it came   ,F40
It would be for Lexapro lol  thanks for the response,F40
My anxiety is created from mine lmao  When you have anxiety  it will manifest itself in all forms ,F40
Fair enough  It is the worry that is making me feel like shit  Wish I could make it stop     Though what am I to do if there's something bothering me that I literally have not yet been able to successfully describe ,F40
I feel like I wrote this,F40
I have a really hard time explaining what happens to me as well  It's a fear of everything  whatever I think about  there is an underlying fear  ,F40
you feel like I copied this  ,F40
No I mean that what you're saying is exactly how I feel,F40
I see  I hope it will get a bit easier for you to make friends once you get more comfortable with the language  I wish you a lot of luck and a happy 2017  ,F40
It actually helps me relax  ,F40
This x100  My therapist told me the same,F40
This is very similar to what I've been going through  Maybe check out my posting history and let me know if there's anything you want to talk about ,F40
Having a stable relationship is a good way of having support and keeping yourself grounded when facing all the bad stuff anxiety throws at you  at least in my experience ,F40
I have no idea   Edit  I guess I would find it shameful   ,F40
I really do not recommend self medicating with alcohol  My boyfriend did that with his depression and was an alcoholic for 15 years,F40
Yeah man that only happens to me when I'm in an uncomfortable environment ,F40
The reason I dont have social media  That and the fact I dont have friends  ,F40
Ok thanks  can't really go to a professional though  I guess i'll try 'stop caring'  ,F40
Alcohol makes my anxiety worse  So does caffeine and sugar  ,F40
Removing this post based on prior comments identifyiing poster as a troll   If this is not the case  contact the mods for support ,F40
Your welcome   How are you tonight   I am just hanging out at home tonight  Not sure if I'll make it to ring in the new year  I'm getting sleepy lol ,F40
laughing  slight glances  talking  i'm simply paranoid around other humans  It's crippling,F40
I'm currently in therapy  Maybe not being prescribed stuff yet means she doesn't think I'll need them  which is nice ,F40
I played it once with friends  it got me out and about for the first time in months  But I haven't played it since  I live in a rural area so it's not very good unless we drive to the city  ,F40
I understand  Looking for ideas can't hurt though    ty for answering my concerns,F40
 I think I'm alright with being around other people  Being alone with my thoughts tends to be way scarier ,F40
Taco Bell gives most people the shits on a good day  I refuse to eat food that's only going to pay 1 hour of rent  ,F40
Hmmm it's the opposite with me  When I'm alone I'm much more calm  It's also weird that you think smoking brought this on because this is also the reason I had to stop smoking  Instant panic attacks and overwhelming sense of consciousness  ,F40
Thanks for that  just might be the motivation I need to pick up the phone and make an appointment ,F40
Same to you  Happy new year ,F40
It always happens during times when I've been stressed for a prolonged amount of time  Thank you though  I've decided to attempt to book a doctors appointment ,F40
Why can't you go to a professional  Is your OCD not being treated at all  If that's the case it'll just move onto a new theme if you beat this one  That's my experience anyway ,F40
As far as i know i was born with mine too  My mom says so at least  Maybe she was the one that implanted it in my head       ,F40
Thank you  it didn't even occur to me to really seek medical advice  but you're right  Thanks for your help  it's so hard to function when I can't feel my hands hahaha,F40
I'm forced to be with my family   and I already told like 10 jokes nobody laughed at   Pretty much a normal Saturday for me  ,F40
"Idk if classifying ERP as ""terrifying"" is helpful  per se  ERP is the main thing that can help people overcome OCD  it's tough  but a godsend for those that stick with it   Cheers ",F40
Thanks   also  do you know the chances of a 16 year old who doesn't smoke chance at getting lung cancer  ,F40
No worries  It's a busy time of year  All the best to you this New Years ,F40
Yeah  im the same way with that  but i still had other aspects of SA back then  But thats actually a good point about the bathroom issue,F40
Had the same thoughts earlier today  You aren't alone in this tonight  ,F40
here's a virtual replychug ,F40
Why not just stay home ,F40
You know I've always wanted to try improv in a way kinda  I heard it helped with social anxiety  ,F40
Don't worry  some jokes bomb it's totally cool  As long as you make yourself laugh it's fine  But then again  it's a lot easier said than done ,F40
Take a breath  List things you want to do and don't want to do  Then make a plan ,F40
I feel you both  I can't remember a time my PTSD and depression have acted up this much  It's really making me hate the holidays ,F40
Pour water on your arm from a sink and change the temperature occasionally ,F40
Best of luck  You'll get through this ,F40
Thanks for the response  I forgot to mention it  but I tried Buspar a few years ago with no results positive or negative ,F40
How did you deal with POCD  I'm sooooo scared,F40
My mom said it didn't do much for her either  honestly  Might be because I'm borderline underweight that I'm getting anything out of it,F40
"This along with ""if they wanted to come  they would have said 'yea  I'd love to see you '  I don't know why I attempt to make plans with people ",F40
Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing   You can read a lot about it here    http   www emdria org  page 2,F40
oh snaps   huh     i'll be damned   didn't know it existed   ty ,F40
no problem  I had no idea what it was until my therapist suggested it to me  I've done two sessions of it   and it actually really is helping me ,F40
Hey OP  I am actually going through this now  I took 2 drags from a joint and it hit me  At that time heart started racing and I am having the worst panic attack  Would really appreciate some tips to deal with this ,F40
I have also found that alcohol and or Opiates WRECK my thoughts for about a week  It feels like I'm starting all over after each time I drink or take a Vicodin for my back pain  Time to make some adjustments I guess ,F40
I often have symptoms after reading about them  It feels so real that they're scary  but it's also too coincidental that I would really have them  ,F40
Happy new year    Stay strong brother  ,F40
I was underweight when I took it  The psychiatrist I saw at the time said that it would either help or do nothing   pretty low risk medication   so I'm glad it's working for someone    ,F40
Puts me to sleep in 25min ,F40
Happy new year  We'll be all right ,F40
 I prefer this one  https   s media cache ak0 pinimg com 564x f5 59 d7 f559d77e7864ede35918033364fca563 jpg  ,F40
Haha that one is wonderful ,F40
Oh I hope I can sleep too  I have had insomnia since August  ,F40
That's because we try to not scream in front of others   Trust me I have a LOT of mom friends and 99  of us struggle   Yes I remember that show   Love Lois  ,F40
Probably  once you start liking someone  you find more reasons to like them and you are less likely to see flaws as well ,F40
You will get over this  Depression is rough  You are going to feel like you will never be well again  but that's just the depression talking  Try to seek some help from a therapist and or a psychiatrist  Wishing the best for you  ,F40
I get what your saying  I get bothered because I'll have racial slurs in my head even with my own race ,F40
Wow  This really hit home  I ceased to do that  I  Know i should be doing this but I put it off,F40
Why were these helpful comments deleted  It seems like  r anxiety has a religious agenda  I feel like this should be addressed  ,F40
So what was her excuse for not making lunch   ,F40
I got High off of brownies and had intrusive thoughts  However  while high I don't tend to respond to thoughts and remain extremely calmed  This caused me to panic and now I'm anxious again  But thank you so much for replying,F40
I put it off too  but I think if the habit gets started it will continue and become just part of your day  I have more intrusive thoughts that I didn't mention and really feel that the journaling will help ,F40
I can totally understand where she is coming from  Her boys are just out of control and full of trouble since birth and she is just overwhelmed and these are not your average boys  ,F40
It's okay  man ,F40
Check out DBT   I have similar thoughts worries and myths and this therapy method has helped me a lot  ,F40
I got sick and and then told get back to work then got cranky sicker and was told to leave ,F40
It was terrifying for me is what I meant but you're absolutely right  It is what helped more than anything else ,F40
I literally stumbled onto it while digging through Reddit wasting time since my wife is at work  Realized my unanswered question and decided to ask ,F40
I'm glad I'm not the only one  Then I spend ages contemplating if I should delete it or not ,F40
Nevermind  he deleted his account not the comments  ,F40
hah  yeah      i find that the less i think about my crippling mental illness  which isn't often but   the less i fuck up my actual life ,F40
What if you don't know what you want ,F40
Thank you for your support  I really appreciate it  Unfortunately I don't have the messages as they took place via snapchat   ,F40
I get psychotic reactions if I'm not tired enough to sleep  and regardless I end up exhausted and depressed the next 2 days,F40
Volunteered to work 4 hrs early  My coworkers all were surprised that I came in early  Now I feel like a loser because they know nothing is at home for me ,F40
"I know my thought was always ""if they wanted to talk to me  they'd initiate a conversation "" Got very lonely and loss a lot of friends in one year     Good luck in the new year  I think we all need it  ",F40
Happy New Year  From one lurker to another ,F40
You should seek out counselling or a therapist  ,F40
Thank you for the response  I am sorry you have this reaction  ,F40
You feel SA when you change profile pics also   ,F40
Hey can you link any of the podcasts  It's definitely something I'd want to atleast try someday  ,F40
Not true  Just because you came to work early does not in any way shape or form make you a loser  ,F40
Ok is good  Have a happy new year   ,F40
You too   ,F40
Alcohol is a stimulant in low doses  I would not recommend it at all for anxiety  If you get a lot in your system it will become a depressant intoxicant  ,F40
Here's to another year of being scared shitless of everything but doing it anyways   Remember  there's no bravery without fear  keep it up ,F40
congrats buddy  I always feel nauseous but have not thrown up in a long time as well  It's the small victories ,F40
I'm really hoping this is the case  Thank you for your perspective,F40
I wish friends would text me  But im a boring loser  so why would they ,F40
Thank you  Happy New Year ,F40
My advice would be to try other therapists  Although it might feel nice to feel almost like you're friends with your therapist it's better to have a therapist who can guide you through your issues  ,F40
Maybe I'll start with genetics to test the waters  I'm generally skittish with opening up   Thank you for the advice  Happy New Year ,F40
You did it  Congrats     You sound like an interesting guy  and I'm glad you overcame your fear of posting to share yourself with us  Good luck with your therapy ,F40
This also applies to sports scores  If I doesn't go the way I envision  I could twitch in my eyes or other facial muscles  The numbers need to make sense    I know this sounds very odd ,F40
I just recently wrote a blog post that I think may help you  http   ariaesthete com married anxiety guide happily ever  Good luck in your endeavors  ,F40
Thanks I'm going to schedule an appointment with an allergy specialist and see what's up  Thanks for the advice ,F40
Are you asking if you were raped by your mother's boyfriend  Or your friend ,F40
yeah     it's definitely a struggle but we'll all get through this  cheers to finding someone else who understands though ,F40
Is your post still up  Do you have a link to it or can you give me the gist of it    Also I'm not entirely sure what your question is  Are you asking why his comments got removed ,F40
There is no better way to dismiss someone than just slapping the SJW label ,F40
So your parents saw you running around in a panic  they called out to you  you didn't hear  and they let this go on for 30 minutes without chasing you down or getting close enough for you to hear them ,F40
This thought comes to mind basically whenever I see someone on social media posting about a party or something  Thank you for letting a lot of us know we are not alone  ,F40
Don't be so hard on yourself  Those things aren't as simple as clicking your fingers and being a different person  It's a long process  and you shouldn't feel so disheartened  you have 364 days left to succeed  ,F40
"It could be a million things  It could be nothing  Are these ""symptoms"" always random  Do they appear when you're stressed or worried about something  Do they get worse when you notice them ",F40
I'm so proud of you  I have anxiety toward doctors and medical facilities  and I've had to do exactly what you did today  I know just how hard it can be  so please believe me when I say that I'm incredibly proud of you ,F40
When did this all start  ,F40
Hey  Still thinking of you and sending my love ,F40
Relaxing  What's that  Never heard of it  Haha  Not possible for me  ,F40
What meds did you get ,F40
Sorry to hear that  How does your anxiety manifest itself in your life  ,F40
I'm sorry you're going through this  I can relate to a lot of what you're saying  Feel free to inbox me if you'd like to chat  ,F40
I don't go to college  but I will obsessively plan every aspect of my life  I make plans and then I make plans for plans  It's just a coping mechanism  ,F40
There are worse things out there to deal with anxiety  at least weed is only bad for your lungs  if you smoke it   It isn't corroding your liver like booze or frying your brain like benzos  ,F40
Im supposed to start at midnight but came in at 8pm  Thanks though ,F40
Lexapro really helps me  It at least takes the edge off  As mentioned below it does kill your libido though   Also  no good doctor would describe benzos long term  they're too addictive and the more you take  the more you need  ,F40
i really appreciate you taking time to help me see that my way is apparently working  Thank you so much   ,F40
Seventh grade was the start but it all started coming down just this year a few months ago to where I can't handle the constant feeling of terrible anxiety and wanting to throw up even if I'm just alone ,F40
It sounds like anxiety to me  And my guess is that you don't feel anxious when working exercising sleeping because you're distracted  So when you start to feel anxious  perhaps try distracting yourself with something  Or mindfulness meditation  It works for some people  ,F40
I suffer from health anxiety  yes  Googling certainly does not help  Have you seen a doctor about this ,F40
Have you tried explaining your anxiety to your friends  And asking them to lay off you a little  Or instead of ignoring them and looking like a pussy  your words  how about just laughing it off  ,F40
The mod answered your question perfectly  But I'd just like to say that I'd love to hear some of your writing if you'd like to share  Feel free to inbox me   ,F40
Ah  kk   glad to hear it    ,F40
Check out rainn org for how to support a friend and some information on laws  Also feel free to share it with your friend  They have a online chat and over the phone hotline  ,F40
Panic disorder is characterised by sudden intense panic attacks   GAD is characterised by excessive  uncontrollable an often irrational worry  Can be with or without panic attacks   ,F40
Ive been reading and this seems like the right thing to do  Thank you  at this point id just like to be prepared for in case this gets out and she wants to pursue this legally  Do you know where I can ask for that ,F40
Ah so is living with your mother what's causing this  ,F40
Works wonders for me  That being said  just 2 3 of a pill of the lowest dose knocks me cold in 30 min no problem ,F40
jesus man  I always kinda knew that is was my family and shit but like  it just hit me hella hard  I know what I need and I've known for a long time but fuck its hard to have to wait two years to get it,F40
Are there any other family members you could stay with  Or any local charities agencies that may help you moving away from your parents if they're causing you to be this unhappy anxious  ,F40
I find that chasing the workout high helped  So every sweat sesh came with its own incentive   ,F40
Not so good   my friends totally blew me off so I ended up getting drunk and watching TV with my immediate family  Could be worse though I suppose ,F40
thank you  I'm going to talk to my doctor when I go get some their stuff checked out    ,F40
Aww  Thanks again so much  Feel free to message me anytime    ,F40
Thank you  I'll take you up on your suggestion and check out rainn  However I think I have to have a long talk with my s o tomorrow about where to go from here  I appreciate the response at such a late hour  ,F40
Hah  I wish my new years resolutions were as ''easy'' as this one   ' ,F40
I'm afraid this year won't be better just by hoping that it will  Time to start making small changes and the big changes will come    happy new year and all the best for the future ,F40
You're very welcome  In my experience you rarely know whether or not you're suffering unnecessarily until you've stopped suffering  Good luck and feel better soon ,F40
EMDR might help  It means imagining the stressful event and moving the eyes right and left  https   www youtube com watch v dzrZCSwLANo,F40
If it really helps you should try the oil in the long term not sure about the dose and     doesn't damage your lungs and brain not sure about the 2  one ,F40
I developed mine  Growing up I was very out spoken  Then a series of traumatic things happened that made me take a back seat to my life  I had my SA ever since 8th grade  ,F40
Grad school is hard  Anxiety can make grad school much  much harder  Being forced to drop out because you can't take it anymore can be devastating  Make sure you have a strong network of support ,F40
Why  You started by saying a hot chick was interested in you  and ended with that  What happened to make you feel that way ,F40
What a weird game it is huh  Thanks again   ,F40
Follow through with what  The girl ,F40
I don't know that this is really an anxiety probably or more of a nervousness shyness  Have you thought about maybe texting him  it writing him a letter  or something like that ,F40
That sucks  it does  but life isn't all about getting chicks  I'm sure you have a lot more going for you  and a lot more to live for   ,F40

I have not changed my Profile pic from the last 4 years because of SA ,F40
Mediocre  Definitely not  that is awesome   Well done you  that's an achievement    I think it's definitely hard to do things once you've been disheartened  but definitely we should keep on trying  as you have  ,F40
Why does it keep you up at night  Because you don't find that sort of existence fun  There are plenty that don't  my friend  I am with you on this one  I don't find that kind of life appealing either  ,F40
Hope you get better soon cause this sucks   ,F40
Why wouldn't you be able to get medication and keep it hidden  You're 18  it's your body  your choice  ,F40
And I am sure they do  You said you have friends  this girl was interested in you  so surely she must have enjoyed your company ,F40
If you are worried about it speak to a counsellor or therapist for a proper diagnosis   It does sound like some kind of anxiety issue though  yes ,F40
Comgratz 2016 first year vomiting n stomach pain started for me ,F40
Look  I'm sure you have heaps to offer and lots of girls would love to get to know you  But as lonely as being single can be  relationships aren't the be all and end all  Have you tried dating  online or otherwise ,F40
Happy new year and congrats on taking the first steps towards improving your health  ,F40
Doing it anyways  Even if it makes us look like a total social idiot  ,F40
Oh I misunderstood  I'm sorry  So you mean like wasting your time in life  Well I will say everyone worries about that  It's a big subject  Can you give us more context  What made you think about this topic ,F40
Thank you so much   At least I'm not the only one ahahahah,F40
Well then how did you write this ,F40
I hope the same for you  I'm right there with you  Having a mini meltdown because of it as we speak     gotta love it  ,F40
On my iPhone    And I certainly didn't indicate that any of this was rational  because it's clearly not ,F40
I am feeling better  thankfully  Nice quiet nite and home with hubby  I barely made it to 10pm  no ball drop for me  Did you make it ,F40
No problem    It can happen to everyone ,F40
Thanks for the suggestion  What's the difference between regular CBT and DBT  Can I do this by myself at home  I already see a therapist and we do some form of CBT and I don't want to change the therapy midway    ,F40
 Another year of being a kissless friendless virgin    Well  that's up to you ,F40
Thank you for the support  It's just nice to know that someone else understands ,F40
i hope day 1 has already proved a success for you and that each day gets easier  ,F40
Lots of people understand xx,F40
Not sure if I actually hate humans ,F40
Well if they have SA it's probably the easiest to approach woman on Internet knowing she has the same problem  Dreaming of rescuing you  accepting you and all that hopeless stuff ,F40

congrats  really brave of you ,F40
Where do you live ,F40
Well done man  the only posts I've made on here lasted about 2 minutes before I have to delete them  ,F40
You said you don't wanna touch phones    lol    ,F40
This happens nearly every time I drink  which is why I don't too much anymore  I always just try to remind myself that a couple days from now these fears will be long gone  it calms it a little bit ,F40
"So what if you are bisexual  lol  I see nothing wrong in it  even if you are straight  sometimes you can get a little ""gay"" lol    ",F40

I understand how ERP can be done for compulsion  I can do that  But I couldn't understand how to do ERP with intrusive thoughts which don't lead to compulsions but just keep on repeating themselves  Any suggestion ,F40
I took it last night  and was still up  tossing and turning  Hoping that tonight it works  I had eaten a lot before taking it  so maybe that affected the results  ,F40
I know exactly what you mean  Just practice not reacting  ,F40
Happy new year   Nope  I didn't make it either lol  I think I fell asleep around 11 00   I am going to visit some family later on today  ,F40
Yeah that sounds like rape to me,F40
Congratulations  Best of luck for your two year streak ,F40
I ate healthier basically  More protein foods like chicken and turkey  more salads with low fat dressing ,F40
I've been considering therapy for a while for my depression  but with all this going on it's probably a good idea to just go for it ,F40
My main goal for this year is going to a psychologist and opening up   What about you OP    ,F40
Yea  right before bed is my scariest time  Somehow submitting to the loss of control that is sleep is terrifying ,F40
I was super alone on NYE too  I felt a bit weird and sentimental st times but otherwise it was perfectly fine  ,F40
Yep  I would have done the same thing until that was confirmed  Have a great day   Happy new year    And always remember your hygiene that'll help protect you from all sickness    ,F40
It seems that she played me  She's blocked me on everything and hasn't responded to any of my messages  I'm just heartbroken  I really though we had something ,F40
Hey man  Wanna talk on messenger or iMessage    Also suffer a lot and wouldn't mind someone to talk to  Cheers,F40
That's really  really kind of you  You're a great person for helping people with social anxiety  I honestly thought people like you wouldn't exist anymore in this society  Anyways  I hope you'll reach your goals  thank you    ,F40
Wow  this sounds very professional  Everything in this song is so true  and I'm sure everyone on this sub can identify with it  Thank you for this wonderful piece of art ,F40
Which medication helped you  My doctors haven't suggested anything specific yet and I'm kind of nervous to go on any meds   ,F40
Thank you  There are many awesome people on this forum  I'm glad to hear you are taking steps to achieve your goals    hope you keep us informed about your progress  Very best of luck in the new year,F40
I take Effexor but the medication that helps me at night is called remeron  it calms and causes sleepiness  ,F40
I also take klonopin at night as well,F40
Thank you so much  I know you are right  My title itself should tell me something lol  Sometimes it feels like I just need someone to day it too me  I really appreciate the response thank you ,F40
It helps just knowing there are people who have gotten through it  Thank you   ,F40
Sorry to hear  There sure is someone who is the one for you  Don't lose hope  I hope too  ,F40

I'm the same way  I'm pretty self sufficient and need very little input from people  but it had helped with my issues  We can surely get lost in our own head ,F40
Thanks  by the way  what is TOCD ,F40
What about a family  When you're already old  it'd be nice if there were people who'd be thankful for you being their parent  taking care of you  helping out   ,F40
It did  thank you  I was lucky enough to avoid huge crowds besides being in the nightclub but I found a spot right under the air conditioner so that kept me sane lol ,F40
Wait  what's ERP  I'm knew to the Reddit and the OCD subreddit so I'm still learning lots of terms ,F40
I don't think so  I have a very vivid visual imagination as it is  I think this is just my worries coming into that ,F40
So are you actually seeing things or is it your brain trying to convince you you're seeing things even though you don't visually see it ,F40
My goal is to smile and greet people when I see them at work for 90  of the time ,F40
That sounds like schizophrenia and not OCD or some combination of the two  Idk what psychology your gf and that nurse are studying but it's very different than what I've learned   This is like textbook schizophrenia ,F40
Sorry if it feels that way  But I want those who have PTSD to not be offended ,F40
It's like a biological imperative to be social  even though it's not really what I want  So weird  It always makes me feel worse ,F40
I don't actually see things  more like in my mind's eye ,F40
thank you so so much  I worried so much that my flirting somehow takes away the legitimacy of the assault  thank you  and I think I will go to my teachers when the break is over,F40
this is good advice I'm going to try it myself  thank you  ,F40
"Thank you  It gives new leads and tools to use  Sometimes I just want to live   ""free""     Happy new year ",F40
propranolol is great  as mentioned above  it prevents physical symptoms but that helps your thinking too  it's far easier for panicky thoughts to overwhelm you if your body is panicking too  it gets me through anxious situations pretty well   ,F40
I would really like to make some friends at work and go on at least one date before the end of the year ,F40
So you're not actually seeing blood coming out of doors  ,F40
Stands for exposure response therapy  it's a type of cognitive behavioral therapy that involves confronting an obsession  the thoughts  but refraining from compulsions  the rituals   It's very effective in treating OCD  ,F40
No  not real blood  Just sort of a mental picture of it happening ,F40
That's good it's effective but it sounds torturous  I'd be so scared to do it ,F40
Ah so then it sounds like OCD ,F40
Wow thank you so much  I really appreciate the advice and those articles  It's so true that they're just thoughts  They scare me but they have no real power over me ,F40
I've really really needed to hear that  Thank you so so much  ,F40
You're welcome  Good luck and be proud of yourself for making the decision to get better  This is a huge victory ,F40
Ya it is  but it's completely worth it  Anxiety will be through the roof when trying to not do the compulsion but it will come down and you slowly train your brain to break away from the patterns of OCD,F40
Yeah  my Doctor called them hallucinations  but I'm guessing that was a mis labelling ,F40
Do you have a history of anxiety  Are you on any medications for anxiety panic attacks  ,F40
If this is your GP then he probably doesn't know the correct terminology  Most medical doctors are not well versed in psychology  unfortunately ,F40
That's good  I'm planning on telling my loved ones to tell me I'm asking for reassurance when I am  Is this a kind of ERP  since I'm not getting the reassurance I want ,F40
What  Fuck that shit it's 2017  B  Seriously though that ridiculous  don't let it bring you down,F40
I sometimes have this happen  Almost like I'm really really cold and just shivering  Only problem is it happens regardless of temperature  ,F40
I did ecstacy at a big festival last night  By the time it had worn off I realized I was still dancing my ass off and being very social  It helped show me my true self and I plan on trying to bring it out this year ,F40
If that's what you want hope for then by all means make a family  It's like a little society in itself  However not everyone wants can make one  especially due to SA  ,F40
Happy new year  We can all pull through this together  no matter how bad the anxiety is ,F40
theyre the ones with the problem  do they think youre psychic ,F40
Are you seeing a therapist  You might need exposure therapy to work through this fear    ,F40
Go to the festival that I've already bought the tickets for  don't be a complete hermit and maybe even get a job ,F40
Yeah  I realize now that in the long run it probably won't work out  Thanks for the help ,F40
I can't resist it  it will keep coming back  I try to resist it and go to sleep one day  next morning I try to remember it  it's tiring  I can't even sleep sometimes because it need to be written ,F40
Well hey don't loose all motivation either  just take a step back and judge yourself fairly and DO NOT beat up on yourself whatever the outcome  ,F40
Another member of the club here    Just trying to hang on,F40
This is actually common with your eyes closed when experiencing mono  I don't experience it much anymore but it all started when I started having extreme symptoms of mono when I was in 5th grade  Hospitalized for three days because of it  ,F40
Not currently  I was considering doing CBT but I'm not sure how well I could handle it ,F40
What clandestine said  I'd also recommend getting out and doing something physical if you think you can manage that ,F40
Yeah  Even I wish  there was someone or some sort of guidance to deal with anxiety at a young age  But I'm glad I understand it better now ,F40
That's exactly why I'm so scared of relationships   ,F40
Very true  I think it was the combination of a new place  lots of people crowded into one room  and the fact I was the only new person  Whatever  ill get over it ,F40
Yeah  but i think that since I was new and don't stand out  they all probably thought I was understanding of their traditions,F40
Gone  A shame I only had one to give  Either way  I strongly suggest journaling to everyone  If you aren't already  google the benefits of journaling and gratitude journaling too ,F40
I used to get it on my right calf muscle  Everything's fine right now  I stopped worrying about the thought that something was wrong  the twitches disappeared  Hope it gets better for you  ,F40
Fuck it  Just do it ,F40
Podcast's  or the like  I find those calm my nerves of the most ,F40
No life being lived is wasted  ever  You'll get through this and who knows you could meet someone who has their own issues  most people do to some extent  you could be their rock despite your own illness  ,F40
Have you considered therapy  ,F40
I think that will be the only thing to be rid of the symptoms ,F40
Always nice to see people here face the fear of SA ,F40
Mine is more dedicated to my depression  To finally lose weight and become thin  I've been fat all my life  I've always dreamed of changing my profile picture to a thin me ,F40
No history and no medication ,F40
You have people  Id love to have people t share these feeling of anxiety with  Gotten sick 2nights in and told to leave work on the 2nd one and am fearing for my job when hopefully theres no reason to ,F40
Wow yes  very recognizable   But I can't say more without some more context  why you broke up  etc  ,F40
Don't feel too bad  My brother's friend came round to our house once and sat on the cat  Poor guy was very embarrassed  cat was fine   ,F40
I recommend reading The Happiness Trap  This book has been helpful for me  still trying to determine my purpose though ,F40
Thanks fkr the reply  I listen to quite a few podcasts but I'm always afraid to listen at night because if I fall asleep I'll lose my place    Got any favorites  particularly ones that it doesn't really matter if you doze off  ,F40
This has nothing to do with traditions   If there was a chair that wasn't free for anyone to sit in  it should have been mentioned to you   That's all on them ,F40
I find writing to be helpful  journaling can be very underrated  Make sure to date them so can track your progress ,F40
for me personally  when i pick i dont feel any pain  no matter how deep i go because i get into a 'mode' and become fairly numb    But yes afterwards the spots do hurt and are sore if i touch them,F40
  You have people  No  I don't ,F40
Maybe that's the factor that will break the log jam for me being excessively self conscious  Thanks for sharing your experience,F40
"How do you define ""seriously egregious""  It's not like I just misspelled a word or something ",F40
That's the plan for sure ,F40

Again  define metric shitton  I have 4 in a 30 word essay  No idea how the hell they all slipped through ,F40
Very appropriate username    ,F40
I am the same way   ,F40
Huh  That happens to me sometimes  It feels like i have boobs  like a pressure on my chest and then i touch my chest to make sure I don't want boobs  Thankfully it's not as serious as my HOCD ,F40
Keep pushing yourself bro  best of luck   ,F40
Yes  and my dad is a doctor so I'm fairly well versed in things like that  I took the first 100mg today  nothing to report except for I feel like I'm on speed ,F40
It's really hard to explain people who don't understand the feeling  Makes it feel even worse  ,F40
My goals are to wake up early  be grateful for everyday  acknowledge negative thoughts and know that they wont get me  and change the way I look at interacting with people and work on enjoying it  ,F40
Depression   Seriously  I never felt truly happy ever till I got on medication ,F40
I'm less affected by it when I'm drunk  But  when the alcohol wears off  there is hell to pay  ,F40
it just seems so dumb  like nothing really means anything to anyone anymore ,F40
i'll be moving out in a year so i'll be sure to do that asap  for now though i live in a small town with not much to do and not many people to meet ,F40
i'm just starting to grow up  still have more than a year till i move out though  side note  are you a writer  you seem like you'd be a good writer ,F40
And this might cheer you up  I love this song    https   youtu be buqtdpuZxvk,F40
Are meds really that worth it  I'm depressed too  ,F40
Thank you so much    How do you stop yourself repanicking after mindfullness  Or do the effects last a long time for you ,F40
I've been trying to cut off caffeine but I'm really addicted to soda since my junior year of high school  Send help  Sophmore in college ,F40
That's exciting   So happy for you    I hope you continue to improve ,F40
Right  This isn't a new topic for me lol   I do know that I enjoy stimulants  rave music  and feeling comfortable around other people  so it's kinda crazy I haven't tried it yet,F40
Me too  Spent NYE sober for this reason ,F40
I've tried Effexor XR and unfortunately it caused a lot of stomach upset  But thanks for sharing ,F40
I'm going to give it a go and hopefully won't mess up on Tuesday  You've saved me ,F40
You're not a pedophile if you are repulsed by the thoughts  They are unwanted  They do not  turn you on    This is really common with OCD  just look online  ,F40
Replace it with seltzer water with fruit  That's what I did  Soda is ridiculously bad for you and your anxiety  I noticed huge improvements when I cut it ,F40
 I guess I need someone to reassure me  This is not what you need  You already know the truth  seeking reassurance just strengthens the cycle of worrying ,F40
As I would love to be off the benzos  I unfortunately can't get off them until my pdoc finds a medicine that will work for me   ,F40
Sometimes yes  Not sure why either ,F40
Have you ever heard of relationship ocd   Reddit has a subreddit called ROCD     it kind of sounds like what you might be going through,F40
This  It's not a real thing  Just an ad hominem used by confused feminists ,F40
That doesn't sound like something a stupid guy would do  More like a very good guy    ,F40
Sounds like you're fixated on the issue and so over thinking it   I think you know this  though  so you're headed the right direction   ,F40
It depends on what you were doing and the guy  Some are oblivious ,F40
Way to be    I really want to do something similar but for 12 months in china  Vietnam or Cambodia  The anxiety thing is a challenge  but I'm hoping I can overcome it ,F40
How are you on your own  Do you like spending time by yourself  ,F40
I agree  La Croix is a good substitute  Still fizzy and has some flavor  ,F40
Yeah it can be a weird weird thing lol  thanks for the advice,F40
Ugh I'm sorry  that really sucks ,F40
I bought a set of adjustable weights for like  50  I can close the curtain and no one can see me    also I can play my own music    yahhhhhhh gyms give me panic attacks too,F40
Just curious  why can't you move to Nebraska ,F40
I saw you post on another anxiety thread too  Are you a therapist  Or someone who has overcome SA  Just curious     Thank you for the great tip  ,F40
Horror movie setting    I relate to that     Panic attacks  anything related to trauma    It is something very serious  and should not be dismissed  or be made fun of  or anything like that   ,F40
 hit the gym  or go out and meet someone else   you can make it all disappear tonight if you wanted  all you have to do is trust yourself and speak to a new person  ,F40
"hugsssss   ""     ""     ""   yah i get that",F40
"yeah a little  im better at identifying it and going ""oh I should calm myself down before it happens"" now than I was before",F40
not at all  if i'm alone for even a couple hours i get really sad ,F40
What about  this do you find funny ,F40
I do my best everyday to touch as little  as possible when I leave my house  Lysol wipes are a godsend  ,F40
Thanks  I'm feeling better now because in hindsight I do think I was justified  ,F40
I have never ever had vomiting from an antibiotic  Maybe some intestinal issues but never throwing up  ,F40
Thanks  it has been 1 year and 7 months  so it has taken awhile to get here  If sharing helps anyone even a little then I'm glad I did  ,F40
Also if anyone doesn't know  green tea is naturally has caffeine in it  I think it actually has more than regular coffee  ,F40
Sounds like you may be physically dependent which is slightly different to addicted  It's still something you want to get help for  ,F40
Yeah it's decaff not uncaff  There's a process to remove caffeine but they can't take it all out  ,F40
Maybe you and she should see a therapist or a counselor  If the anxiety isn't affecting other areas of her life  she doesn't need medication  which makes things simpler  ,F40
It's true  Also  for those who don't know  mild roast coffee has more caffeine than dark roast   Pure caffeine   mild roast   medium roast   dark roast   decaf,F40
I feel like mines the opposite and no matter how much water I drink my mouth is still dry  ,F40
Yep  happens to me  too  I'm very aware of any sensation in my mouth or throat  I blame emetophobia ,F40
Thanks for the response  I understand what you're saying but I don't feel as though this is just a period or a phase that I'm in  this is how almost my entire life has been so far  How did you change things in your own life ,F40
I feel the same way  And people being angry at me makes me afraid of them ,F40
Also the bus  It's a nightmare and i only use it for 10 minutes a day I can't touch anything there,F40
Have you gone to therapy  You CAN have the things you want  it will just take a shit ton of work  ,F40
Same here  They don't even have to be yelling at me  Just a raised voice  My earliest memory of this was hearing my dad yell at the TV downstairs when football was on  Made my heart stop  ,F40
Have you tried talking to a doctor  I think that's your best option ,F40
I've never heard of CBT  Thank you for responding  I'm looking into it now   ,F40
SSRI withdrawals are no joke     Usually they taper you off   ,F40
I know I'm oblivious  Most times I assume flirting is just them being nice  not them showing interest  ,F40
Is there a video ,F40
generally  as low self esteem and extreme lack of confidence   ,F40
Fuck it whenever I see someone in Heely's I wish they made a comeback,F40
People who are angry are often just mad at themselves just walk away,F40
When I stopped Effexor for the second time  I took St  John's Wort  B Complex  Aleve  Fish Oil  and lots of Green Tea  It helped a lot I think  ,F40
It's a symptom of anxiety  Happens to me all the time  ,F40
Look up the affects of overdose for your medication  I'd recommend waiting for your appointment but if you're going to do it anyway you should understand the risks ,F40
Sorry meant Cognative behavioral therapy   Brain fart,F40
Good for you  I have anxiety about posting on Facebook but on Reddit I'm fine,F40
Thank you so much  This is really helpful to read  and validating  and reassuring  and comforting  You take care too  ,F40
Great advice  Thanks for posting that ,F40
Wow  congratulations  You definitely should be proud    ,F40
Yes  All I'm thinking about is how I used to go to wild New Years parties have fun  flirt with girls  be relaxed  All of this seems impossible to me now and I'm just alone,F40
That's sucks man  ,F40
Good on you for taking that step  I'm proud and I hope one day too I can go to the movies without having Anxiety   ,F40
Nice job  Do you feel like you could take on other classes now  ,F40
I'm too embarrassed to say this at therapy  I'm bad at it  I don't want people knowing things about me lke this,F40
Thank you  I believe in you  Baby steps   ,F40
I can second this  lol,F40
This is on point  Exactly how it goes  Grr,F40
How often does it happen for you ,F40
"I actually am doing fantastic on Luvox   I definitely agree that it takes time to find the right ""fit ""  Everyone's brain is different ",F40
I have a PRN medication hydroxizine  And trazadone was prescribed but I didn't care to start it ,F40
Fuck them for not letting you know  Also fuck them again for paying attention to something so trivial as if it makes any difference where someone sits ,F40
I feel the same way  Whenever someone is mad at me it's all I can think about  I actually can't focus on anything else  ,F40
They know about my OCD and stuff but the drawing is embarrassing because I'm really bad at it,F40
What do you mean update him  Also my friend is doing well    ,F40
I gotta save this to post on it  I'm in that exact same boat  ,F40
The buddy system is the best way to learn to deal with anxiety   without someone dragging you along you wouldn't go   ,F40
Haha start small   r bodyweightfitness   you can start exercising 5 minutes a day on the floor   Start with hollow holds and planks  ,F40
Anytime  And that sucks    I don't use my snap chat  but I do know that the pictures or whatever gets sent disappears after a little while  but is there any way at all possible to somehow retrieve them or no  ,F40
On thank god this happens to someone else  I thought I was crazy  ,F40
I also support this 100   It took me years and years of going to see my psychiatrist  but I am finally learning how to cope with my own abuse  It never hurts to talk to someone  ,F40
Yes I have it often when I am anxious  It is really my first indicator  ,F40
"It sucks but it does help  it enables me to enter a sort of ""I don't give a fuck"" mode that provides a well needed relief  Often when I drink I think to myself ""this is how 'normal' people usually are  huh  pretty neat""",F40
I'm glad your friend is doing well    Consider telling your psychiatrist exactly what you wrote in your original post  You expressed yourself very well and provided important information that can help him help you ,F40
Try  listening to guided meditation  they have some specifically for falling asleep ,F40
I can't help but tune into the yelling  It's all I've known for a long time  I'm happy my parents are older and more docile now  we feel more like a family  hopefully that's all the therapy I need ,F40
I actually brought my headphones with me and had music playing on my phone for emergencies  And I was alone    thank you for the suggestions ,F40
I experience this as feeling like the person I'm speaking to  and it's usually when I'm talking to someone else  starts to shrink or feel further and further away  ,F40
But was the Chinese food good  Now I want some  I think I have the fixings for fried rice now that I think of it  Maybe later this week I will go get some Mongolian beef ,F40
"Or are these so called ""microsaccades"" ",F40
YAYS    That's great  Where did you go to  Did you enjoy yourself   I don't always enjoy myself when I go out but getting there and am able to do so now more and more  it's awesome     ,F40
This happens to me when I'm extremely anxious,F40
Tell us more   ,F40
Wow what a bunch of dickheads ,F40
What medication are you taking    ,F40
Visited Grandma and went to a new park by her place  It was a nice outing ,F40
Hmm i take 50mg and ive missed doses before  didnt notice any side effects tho   But maybe wait for more responses as your dose is higher than mine    Cant you call ur doc  ,F40
Maybe acceptance is the step to a better fortune ,F40
Very well said  ,F40
I've heard Cymbalta  Duloxetine  is helpful at higher doses  I think what we're seeing here is there are many options that may work best for you  Try not to get frustrated and keep working toward better days ,F40
Type 2 diabetes can be effectively eliminated reversed at your age just by losing the weight and eating appropriately  It's not too late to change your life  regardless of how your results come back ,F40
They are jerks  I've noticed that most the time time when anxiety is triggered it because people are being jerks  I just ignore them,F40
Fuck those people  OP  If they'll yell at a new person for breaking an unwritten and uncommunicated rule  they aren't worth the effort ,F40
Please make sure you DO NOT turn to drugs to deal with this    It gets better  I promise  Don't let meth ruin your life like it has mine    Good luck my friend    Love u and happy new year,F40
Green tea definitely has caffeine  but much less than regular coffee   The  abbreviated  hierarchy of most to least caffeine is  coffee  black tea  green tea  decaf coffee ,F40
This would be my choice of life if I didn't feel empty and thinking about the fun I used to have  I think people need friends,F40
You are welcome    Yes I work with people to help them overcome social anxiety ,F40
Yay  That's fantastic  You should be proud  the stuff that feels impossible can be so worthwhile ,F40
I hope that is not the case  I was recently in a similar situation  But  on the bright side  a shelter may be able to refer you to resources to help with mental health  You ARE going to be ok  Hang in there ,F40
I used to be fine with angry people  but now I'm customer service damaged and either panic or completely shut down  I don't understand why adults think that throwing tantrums is acceptable ,F40
I've experienced this in different situations  My body is there but my mind is somewhere completely different  like somebody said  this happens when I'm really anxious about something and then it leads me to zone out of things and generally become completely unaware of my surroundings ,F40
I completely understand how you feel  I've been suffering from anxiety panic for 5 years now and I get palpitations and my heart races  sometimes feels like my heart is just going to stop and I will die  I felt better once I found this thread ,F40
Yup worst case you can take meds and lose weight and self manage  Lots of people live that way ,F40
Tapering is done over weeks or months  not days  To your body  you essentially quit cold turkey ,F40
2 thoughts      1  Why dismiss drugs AND therapy    2  I suppose it would depend on the tic,F40
There might be side effects to increasing the dose  which might in turn not make anything much better  You should really talk to your Doctor beforehand unless it was discussed earlier ,F40
Being happier and making people around me happy,F40
I'm sort of open minded about drugs  hard to explain  but therapy would be completely humiliating   Facial motor tics mainly ,F40
My friend bikes  it works well for him ,F40
Augmentation is very common in the treatment of mood disorders when a patient sees a partial response to a medication like Zoloft  but still would benefit from further medical therapy  Abilify is a very common agent used for augmentation ,F40
"If you bring SA as an excuse then your ""not wanting"" is not genuine but actually a coping mechanism  Like the fox and the sour grapes ",F40
yes definitely  I feel like I'm watching myself in a movie or something   ,F40
Yep same here  ,F40
I'm the same when someone is yelling angrily  I hate angry tones  It's upsets my anxiety and my heart starts racing  ,F40
Hopefully telling your doctor about it will be a huge relief and he can help you deal with it  That's awesome and brave and so hard to do  but it'll be worth it,F40
I'm the same way  but I just kinda shut down and have a full blown episode  Married  and I left the abuse 4 years ago  My husband understands  but he does have a quick temper so this happens nearly daily     ,F40
This sounds fine to me I doubt your friend even noticed honestly ,F40
I am the same way because of my childhood too  I avoid doing anything to make people angry is mostly means I just avoid them lol  ,F40
Oh I'm sorry to hear that  Have you seen a doctor counsellor at all  Do you can you speak about it with your friends   family ,F40
I feel the same  I don't think I'm ever gonna change tbh ,F40
Glad to hear that  It just aggravated the fuck out of my insomnia  ,F40
Same here  sadly  Meds have helped with it a bit though   don't get teary eyed from emotional reaction to anger insults,F40
I am the opposite  whenever their is conflict I get amped up and ready to go  I guess 18 years of ice hockey will do that to you  P,F40
Don't be afraid of therapy  I'm in my early 20s  23  and about to go back  I've had anxiety my entire life and it helped so much  Make an appointment and get out of your comfort zone  Welcome to 2017 ,F40
I feel this way too  and sometimes it's better to focus on yourself and your future  but not to live by the future  Maybe plan for happier and better things  and live happily    ,F40
Yes  The best way to describe it is it's like being high on marijuana  without the psychoactive aspect  if that makes any sense ,F40
Wow  Spot on  Thanks for the share  ,F40
Whether I talk in front of a group of people  I feel like I am not even speaking  only listening ,F40
If it's actually a pimple  then it's not cancer  Scrotum pimples are pretty common and harmless  I hope that's all it is ,F40
Thank you  Feels good to hear from someone similar  ,F40
Yeah  I sometimes feel the same way ,F40
I don't think the veterans suffering from PTSD should have to create another subreddit   Speaking as a rape survivor  I think we all have a lot to learn from one another   Also  the group isn't really high traffic enough to necessitate splitting ,F40
Oh  Regular alk therapy might help then  ,F40
I mean in the immediate future  I just worry about this a lot ,F40
Pure O stands for pure obsession  If there is a compulsion  internally or otherwise  involved with obsessive thoughts  it is OCD  Pure O describes just obsessive and intrusive thoughts that cause distress but not the need to complete compulsions to eliminate that stress ,F40
My goals I made with my therapist are to make it 2 weeks at a job  make it six months at a job  and join a club in my area to meet people  ,F40
Have you tried therapy  I've had severe health anxiety my entire life and therapy is where I receive help that lasts for years  I'm about to go back because it's becoming sever again  I should have actually gone back years ago ,F40
That's what I was thinking  It was just one of those weird thoughts that pops up into your mind  I doubt they even gave it a second thought but I've been anxious about it for days,F40
Currently in therapy  Still in the beginning of it all  Not sure what I should address in this type of situation with my therapist  Is there any sort of thing I should inquire about  ,F40
What    This sounds so weird  ,F40
If you change your lifestyle now it's completely reversible  Watch forks over knives  Do some research  Type 2 is usually hereditary and life style related  Many people can manage without insulin and a lot of illnesses can be prevented by taking care of yourself  ,F40
I cry at nearly anything these days  The slightest tone of disappointment or disapproval puts me on a new level though  I understand how you feel  ,F40
Thank you  I appreciate it ,F40
I'm facing a similar situation  Your post has helped to calm my nerves  Than you  ,F40
Perhaps because they care  Perhaps because it makes them feel better about themselves  and means they can ignore your problems needs  Hard to guess without context  ,F40
I thought i had it rough getting choked out by someone i let in my apartment    Stay strong ,F40
Are we twins   I also have to keep constantly reminding myself that people's emotional states are nothing to do with me  but it can be very hard  especially when your jerkbrain is telling you that all your friends hate you  ,F40
Ha  I just did that so I can find it at a later point when I want to read it,F40
Wow that really sucks  ,F40
You were sexually assaulted   I'm sorry that this happened to you  It was not your fault and this is not normal behavior for an 11 year old ,F40
I'm lucky my momg was there for me  I also have a kid so I know what you mean,F40
That's a good idea  thanks,F40
I guess I was sort of looking for answers  Typing this up really helped honestly  Any coping strategy's in dealing with OCD and Hocd and the like  any advice would sort of be appreciated  but typing up this post really helped honestly ,F40
Do you think I should try talking to my school counsellor   currently in 7th grade ,F40
I've actually dealt with this after a night terror  not just a nightmare    I came back with a clean ECG and diagnosis of a panic attack  The vertigo instability however could be the sign of an inner ear problem,F40
Same  I feel sad and like I want to cry there on the spot when someone uses an extremely assertive voice  They're not yelling but they sound so serious  idk why it makes me scared and sad but it just does  ,F40
Do you have any history of abusive relationships   Not just romantic  but family  friends  etc    My mom always yelled at me and I've always felt traumatized by it  even when other people are yelling and I'm not even involved ,F40
That happens to me  too  Specifically  the sound of an angry male voice really makes me sad  Even if they're not yelling at me  I really don't like it  ,F40
yeah like to the extent that people comment on it too  and in my head I'm screaming HOLY SHIT JUST STOP TALKING,F40
Hell yeah  go you  Online classes are great  ,F40
well everybody has social anxiety of some form even if you've gotten over the worst of it,F40
It's a bit ironic ,F40
My goal is to take therapy seriously and actually trying to connect with people  Isolating myself is only making me worse ,F40
How did I get over it  I made lots more mistakes   I accepted that I was going to cringe a lot  but the more mistakes I made  the more I learnt and it got better,F40
I have this  too  I start shaking  my heart races  it's just awful  It doesn't even have to be flat out anger  it can just be strongly stated disagreement  Makes me feel like I'm so weak  ,F40
I have this problem too and I just try to distract myself until eventually I'm a tiny bit less miserable ,F40
I've just come to accept and embrace it as part of my glorious awkwardness ,F40
shit bro that's the dream  id like a magic wand too please  ,F40
If you're convinced it's not psychological  why are you on the anxiety board     All symptoms you named can be caused psychosomatically  ,F40
Have you tried listening to music when trying to sleep  When I am having trouble sleeping I listen to ambient psybient music  It helps me a lot  ,F40
I live in a family that yells all the time  Music helps a lot to distract the noise  ,F40
I feel you  As a result of similar circumstances  I'm also super sensitive to the tone of voice and can detect upset people a mile away  Thanks  mom ,F40
Actually when you do the deep breathing you want to be aware of it filling up your lungs and exhaling its basically how meditation works  it also helps get your mind off the anxiety ,F40
Have you tried braiding your hair  or used scrunchies   I am sorry if my suggestions are stupid  In my experience making something a hassle has stopped some of my annoying habits  I hope you find a solution that works for you ,F40
Yes  as soon as you can human physically possible  Immediately  Tell your counselor before you even go to class  Just walk in and say you need to talk to someone in private right away  ,F40
I would suggest talking to him   When it happened to me  my now husband was very good to me just as you describe your boyfriend has been in the past   It may be easier if you can talk through it ,F40
Some medications raises your heart rate  maybe that's why yours is a little high   My heart rate was 80 90 when I was medicated  but now I am no longer on any meds and my heart rate is around 55 60bpm resting ,F40
Nah man I'm not taking any meds by what I know,F40
And like someone else suggested  music can help  Some calm ambient music like meditation music can help you stay calm as you guve into it  ,F40
Thank you  It really made my day  and week     ,F40
You mentioned you checked your BPM when you experienced chest pains  Do you have a heart rate monitor fitbit apple watch  ,F40
I find listening to podcasts comforting and provides a good distraction when you need a break from your thoughts  ,F40
I feel you man  been like that my whole life  pills have been a lifesaver though  also the thought of the vast expanse of space and time and how unimportant my life really is brings me comfort ,F40
At least to sleep I turn on a fan and take melatonin  I understand that prescription medications work for some people but I'm against them  want to get over it naturally  but yeah melatonin has been working pretty well for me  good luck ,F40
Yes  I hate when people pity someone just because they didn't spend NYE partying with others  Well  this applies generally  not only to NYE  ,F40
I took it for 3 days  then switched to buspar on the 3rd day  My stomach ache was mostly gone by the day after,F40
I had a day this week where I couldn't make it out of the driveway but the next day I made it out just fine  Some days just suck more than others I guess ,F40
Yep  it's like celebrating a birthday which i find weird  because i'm getting older and hence more regret etc   ,F40
Only a minor setback  ,F40
I used to have it much more  I guess I've just kinda learned to make myself more      present  If that makes sense ,F40
Hi folks   I'm having a really tough time trying to handle my anxiety lately  I'm hoping to seek some new coping methods and identify more about my anxiety in the future  Thanks for having me ,F40
They truly are  And definitely a great stepping stone towards taking a class that requires your physical presence  ,F40
People on reddit are super annoying with the downvotes and use them wroge all the time  They don't even realize it discourages a good discussion  I usually just end up deleting my comment when it gets below 0 after a few hours ,F40
No  if you don't want to wait to see your doctor  call tomorrow and explain your issue over the phone  ,F40
Not everyone is the same or has the same reactions to different substances   I have anxiety with or without caffeine  but with caffeine it gets a lot worse   But everyone is different ,F40
"Probably       changing my wants because of my  ""inabilities""",F40
Save up the   you used to spend on those 5 cups of coffee   after a year  buy yourself something really cool   That could ease some of the pain ,F40
Practice  Doing deep belly breathing several times a day can help you develop the skill and create positive associations with the effects of it  ,F40
 deleted                     0 5360      What is this   https   pastebin com 64GuVi2F 74306 ,F40
Thank you guys for the advice   ,F40
I read that as choking the children and I was  REALLY  confused for a minute there wow I'm tired,F40
Hey  Thanks for the suggestion I am currently looking into it  But then my question is doing so aren't you becoming more aware of things  Like wont your thoughts still be there  ,F40
I finally start talking to people at school  I was very happy  And the attacks are getting milder and bearable these days   ,F40
Sorry for the late reply  haven't used reddit in ages  yes I have very low body fat  ,F40
To be honest  it's a good thing that you try to solve your current task  rather than moving from one another and leaving them incomplete ,F40
The world is your mirror  Good idea,F40
I'm sure this is a meme or something   ,F40
Thank you for sharing your opinion  3,F40
That's pretty much my viewpoint as well  no bad kids  just bad parents  As I said though  what gets to me more  is that I can't command respect ,F40
As a server  I totally feel this ,F40
OMG same here   I act so weird whenever I'm anxious people wonder what's wrong with me ,F40
I do talk a lot so if you want to skip to the pretty bit it starts around 7 30   ,F40
That's good  You can go back to college in the future but sometimes you have limited time to find a lasting job  Nice  ,F40
Good on you  I did the same thing  What work will you be looking for  I'm looking for some as well,F40
thanks man I feel like they will say nothing is wrong and I'm wasting my life and now to tell my parents the next scary step,F40
If it's due to anxiety you shouldn't get fined  I'm guessing you're not going out having fun instead of going to school  so you're fine  Anxiety sucks  I'm sorry it's kicking your ass ,F40
Thanks and yeah I live had a bad day ,F40
thanks man you are the nicest person I have met on this site and I will get back to you after my therapy  thank you  ,F40
Good for you  My similar experience was finally going to the local dnd club  Now i go almost every weekend ,F40
Anxiety is not a mind set  It comes from being around douche bags ,F40
This is fantastic  I have anxiety  and know how hard things can become    Really proud of you ,F40
Chocolate can have quite a bit of caffeine and other stimulants in it ,F40
"Congrats  Are you Dutch by any chance  I noticed you spelled ""Success"" with only one ""s""    ",F40
Yes  that's something to consider  Thanks a lot for your comment  ,F40
How about doing the opposite  Instead of pushing him off you grab him harder  Reach out to him instead of pushing him away  Not sure if talking to him in such detail would be helpful it might freak him out ,F40
Face my fears regularly  ,F40
I got my anxiety from the majority of people around me being negative and treating me like shit  Now I'm almost 22 and missed out on so much life experience I'll probably never recover,F40
No problem  I get sick a lot from stress  the only way I usually am sick  as it ruins my immune system  so I can completely understand ,F40
Yes it does help to feel that we're not alone  I don't wish HA to anyone but it's great to have such a great community on Reddit,F40
Aw  I'm sorry about your relationship  I hope things work out well for you  ,F40
That actually sounds like a neat experience  I sat home and spent NYE with family   and it was boring like every year  I think next year I might do what you did ,F40
If you're straight  you're straight  Nothing wrong with it and no changing it  It's harmful for the bi community for you to say you are when you aren't  so just be whomever you truly feel you are and embrace it ,F40
Used to happen to me but then i discovered that it was caused by eating raw apples  especially fresh ones  ,F40
You need a note from your doctor therapist about your anxiety  My school district got really strict the last year I was there and wanted documentation for absences ,F40
Feel confident in the decision you have made  You made it for the right reasons and that's what's important  Good luck to you in the future  here's to a 2017 with a little less anxiety ,F40
Awesome  I can relate to most of them  Love Sloth and Snooze    ,F40
I can 100  guarantee your friend didn't notice  That is such a small gesture  he probably if anything was worried about offending you if he brushed your chest ,F40
I have the opposite problem  any time I've ever handed ANYONE my dog  they've touched my tits  LOL ,F40
The knowledge that you understand what I'm describing is a huge thing to offer me  and I thank you for that ,F40
haha wow i had no idea anyone else felt the same way  Its true  it does seem kinda silly when I say it out loud,F40
Can you relate to that gut feeling I'm talking about  Do you have any other ways to describe it  It's so new and bizarre to me   ,F40
Oh yeah caffeine that late will guarantee an all nighter   ,F40
I started on 20mg Prozac too  maybe I should ask my psychiatrist to try it again  I just feel bad that I was such a pussy and barely gave it a chance   Edit  Prozac  not buspar,F40
I didn't make it to the class  But I did some self care at home and sat in front of some roses my partner bought me and just meditated on their beauty  ,F40
To be honest  the stomach pain might have been from anxiety  I had the same kind of pain this morning,F40
Yes and it could be pure adrenaline without you realizing it ,F40
I hope you're gonna have the strength to stay next to your bf  All the best for you two ,F40
I'm sorry to hear that  Message me if you want to talk ,F40
Maybe it's time for professional help like cbt therapy  Good chance it can help  get you out of that funk  ,F40
I'm sorry  Message me if you want to talk ,F40
Talk to your doc about your medication either upping the dose or changing it  Dizziness can also be caused by hyperventilating ,F40
Loved the video and song  ,F40
I would think if there was an abscess you would have gotten antibiotics when they did your x ray  I'm sure you'll be fine but you could always call your dentist or oral surgeon and ask their opinion  ,F40
It so nice to see people have the same OCD rules as me    Thanks for sharing ,F40
I actually got married at 21     You can call it a lot of things but I definitely don't consider it an accomplishment  Bad marriage  Stupid marriage  Young marriage  Aaah  ,F40
Yeah  I meant Prozac too  haha  I'm on 10mg buspar,F40
I messaged my psychiatrist  and I see him next week,F40
Good to hear  10mg of buspar hasn't done anything for you  I actually took 30mg at one point and still didn't do anything lol,F40
It's better to make a reasoned decision to improve things than to wait until it all crashes down around your ears and then have to pick up the pieces  Onwards and forwards  and good luck ,F40
I think it did a little at first  but I must have built a tolerance to it  It's 10mg 3 times a day  so I guess technically 30mg,F40
Naw I took a full 30mg in the morning ha and still nothing  Do you wanna try something else  ,F40
Thank you for this  You are an amazing person  This means a lot to people suffering from anxiety ,F40
Exactly  It's very hard to overcome ignoring it  I can even twitch    Wondering what type of OCD this falls under ,F40
I'll see what my psychiatrist recommends  He's off today,F40
Thank you and I hope anxiety becomes a past for you soon ,F40
Glad i'm not the only one  Sometimes it feels like I am  which is why reddit is great haha ,F40
She has to learn to control her emotions   This is not anxiety   ,F40
Its the job of the father to discipline kids who are being bullies   It isn't your job  Nothing pathetic about it  ,F40
Interesting  thanks  Worth a try   ,F40
I would tell your boyfriend how you feel but I don't think it's reasonable to have him stop hanging out with his friends  If you really don't want to be around them than i would hope that your boyfriend would be understanding  ,F40
Therapy is what helps OCD ,F40
If you feel comfortable talking with him her  then yes ,F40
I haven't  I'll try it  I had this wooden coaster on my bedside desk  I ended up just gripping that to keep me grounded to reality  It helped a lot  ,F40
Yep  I've let it happen for minutes on end but it just stays  And it's too terrifying to let it happen any longer   ,F40
If you learnt any coping mechanisms in therapy utilize them when you can  If not I'd possibly recommend contacting your GP  ,F40
Your muscles get tense   This is the fight or flight response   Massage is one way to relax ,F40
I read that and had the same reaction as you  I can't believe that people had to spell it out for them  Emetophobia or not  who wants to be in a room with vomit in it  Ugh ,F40
Thank you for your post  I agree that accepting anxiety rather than fighting it can help  ,F40
If you don't feel right about your current therapist  get another therapist ,F40
I can relate to pushing people away  But your story gives me hope     ,F40
Aw  im so happy I was able to help  ,F40
"""I don't exactly have a lot of problems making friends or talking to girls""  This is not social anxiety  This is your basic high school crush ",F40
I absolutely adored this  I also suffer from anxiety but sometimes am able to find freedom in visiting new places  though flying is very difficult for me   So happy to see below that my hometown of D C  welcomed you with open arms  ,F40
Same thing happen to me I think it took 2 and half months before I actually got to see a therapist  Depending on the time year determines how long you wait I think  ,F40
Hey girl  Its really sound like youre going to need therapy and possibly some medication for anxiety  Have you talked to your parents about either of those things   Im sending you my positive vibes  3,F40
What happened to your marriage if you don't mind me asking   On behalf of other couples who married young  Who would like to stay married and learn from other couples  ,F40
That's better than what I did  I went to bed at around 9pm,F40
I love calling a cab  normally the driver is really nice and we have an entertaining conversation    Hope you find your girl and cheers   ,F40
This is weirdly similar to my 2017 goals  Thanks for sharing ,F40
"I have a tic where my head will jerk in a random direction  Sometimes you can hear my neck pop  ""Crack "" I take medicine now and it's been significantly reduced  It was bothering me so much I just wanted to cry",F40
Why even reply to this guy's post if you're going to be this way about it  What positive thing that actually benefits your life do you get out of it ,F40
I did  This was over a month ago and I've been long done with the antibiotics ,F40
I have that too  I have had lots of experience with emotional abuse though ,F40
that video was great  it completely lifted my day  thank you  its so great that you did that  i'm proud of you    ,F40
I want to find a job  but i'm afraid that i won't be able to be so close to people in the open space office  I mean it's too close  less then 0 5m between people ,F40
Thank you for the reply  I will definitely check out rainn  i really just want all this to be over ,F40
Hey  Awesome vid and really uplifting  I'm going through something similar  if this isn't too personal of a question how did you let get yourself our of that feeling   being stuck inside yourself I mean  Although maybe the answer is different for everyone,F40
"Hasn't it actually been proven that ""positive thinking"" or rather the forcing of oneself to do so has the opposite effect  ",F40
Ha  thankfully all the coffee is free  Working at a hospital has its perks ,F40
Have you tried sleeping medicines  melatonin pills  or anxiety medication benzos ,F40
Hang in there mate  hope things get better,F40
Good for you  school isn't for everyone but it can be really hard to find your own path  Sometimes family doesn't really get it but these tips may help you tackle their questions  http   blog tranqool com 2016 12 20 questions at family dinner ,F40
I had surgery for some abscessed teeth  lower front  that kept filling my chin with puss  The surgery was unpleasant but it fixed the problem and I'm fine now  Don't worry  Go get the diagnosis and treatment you need  ,F40
I often get blurry eyes and double vision  especially late in the day  Been thoroughly checked out by eye doctor and neurologist and they couldn't find anything wrong with me  ,F40
Hey  I'm an uber driver too  It really is exactly as you described  I was nervous at first  but now i'm kind of addicted   I didn't drive for NYE though  I was at home helping a new pet settle in my home ,F40
Thanks  I know seeking reassurance just kinda strenghtens my anxiety   it feels like it helps but in reality it doesn't  ,F40
"Haha I know I'm not a pedophile  but my thought is constantly ""What if ""  I always question my morals and myself  It's horrible",F40
Respect  good on ya   im travelling currently on my own and i suffer from anxiety  can be tricky at times but glad i packed my bag  ,F40
You're very thoughtful  thank you so much for taking the time to write this    it really helps  and it does make sense ,F40
I try also to do that  but usually the thought is still there  cus deep down I still kinda focus on that thought  I guess I just need to calm down and not latch on  Thanks for the advice  ,F40
Yeah that's OCD lol  You just have to remind yourself that it's your OCD talking  not you  And OCD tells  lies ,F40
Is that an everyday thing  I haven't had a problem with my vision at all  The doctor said my vision is fine  My eyes just ache all the time ,F40
It has gotten worse since I've been worrying so much about it  If I was confident that what the doctor told me was going to help then I don't think I would be worried so much ,F40
Yea these are beautiful  I love all of them but the last one I made my desktop  Does she have more ,F40
Yep I have it every day though not always all day and some days are worse than others    my eyes don't ache though  so I guess we don't have the same problem   p,F40
Never just you  Have you spoken to your roommate about that happened  I usually try to diffuse the situation by ignoring it and never wanting to talk about it again  but it's bad conflict management  You can do it ,F40
How do you travel without being rich    Not being snarky btw  just wondering if you have some frugal travel tips ,F40
Thanks for the reply   also does the symptoms I listed sound like bronchitis ,F40
Guided meditation  YouTube  SoundCloud  Spotify  Google Music  etc have playlists specifically suited for you and your partner  ,F40
It's more dangerous to feel safe at home than to feel terrified around people ,F40
Thanks for your response  I am not looking for a sliver bullet  just something that can takes the pressure off  or makes the thoughts a little more intermittent   Did you end up ever finding a some what helpful medication    ,F40
Did you have a good experience on Prozac  ,F40
Thank you  it means a lot  Great idea by the way  I'll definitely do a video on how I got to this point    happy 2017 to you ,F40
Thanks for your response  I guess I am just tired of obsessions coming out of no where and becoming life consuming  and I was hoping to start this process with the proper medication  Do you have any advice to combat hopelessness   ,F40
I go the other way  Eat until I am full and keep going  And then panic about the inevitable nausea  ,F40
Can't take them forever  It's better if you can deal with it on your own   Takes effort though  ,F40
The only reason they gave to leave the room was that some people are sympathetic pukers  No one seems to have any damn germ awareness and I don't get how anyone would not want to prevent something as horrible as Norovirus ,F40
Yep been there  It was only after the fact  weeks after  that I realised what it was ,F40
 D The little puffin  This is wonderful ,F40
I am so proud of you  Look at you go ,F40
YW  OC  ,F40
What do you do when you travel alone   I just got divorced earlier last year   One thing I enjoyed was traveling with someone else   How can I really make the most of traveling by myself ,F40
You need to realize  you'll make more mistakes by worrying and fearing  Mistakes are normal and even you mentioned people before you have done it  Just keep doing your project without worrying and double check whatever you're doing  ,F40
I'm not worried about the surgery  it's the 23 day wait and the location that bothers me,F40
The more you worry the more you're going to stress yourself out  Mistakes will happen  You are not a robot  We are human beings  Simple  Just breathe  ,F40
Yes  certainly a mis labelling  Make sure he  and the rest of your professional support group  understands that what you're experiencing are vivid intrusive thoughts  Try to monitor how often they happen and if there's any triggers ,F40
Even if you weren't scared of it  why would you want to risk getting sick or smell it  The whole thing just makes my skin crawl  ,F40
"Gross  I don't care if they haven't hurt anyone yet  the fact that they have those thoughts is bad enough  I'll never ""accept"" them ",F40
The fact is is that normalization of this socially is reprehensible ,F40
Yeah  I can relate  Most of the time I'm torn between 'Don't be so quiet  you idiot' and 'Shut up  you're just being awkward    Ends up being a weird combination of silence and nonsensical outbursts most of the time  ,F40
I wish I could just drop out too ,F40
My 2017 goals are to just be able to pay tuition and make it to graduation   ,F40
It's OK  it's not really your fault  those first days suck  What's your job if u don't mind me asking ,F40
I've tried  it doesn't do anything really   ,F40
Thank you for your reaction and good perspective  I also put massive pressure on the relationship I had with her  but do you know or anyone on this forum how to get over it  ,F40
This is not your fault  they are rapists ,F40
It really does take some time to find the right therapist but please keep trying because when you do find the right one you will really see a change  If you find one who pushes medication and that makes you uncomfortable  keep searching  Don't give up ,F40
Yes  about 10 years for OCD ,F40
I hate the feeling of crippling anxiety  All anxiety feels awful  but that one is the worst  I don't even have answers for myself  but I do understand how you feel  ,F40
Not usually  Why would they  If they have no complaining witness  and now complaining statements  they have no case of something being illegal  Cops are there to manage lawfulness  ,F40
I do the same with my lips aswell  I'll start using Vaseline maybe that will help with that  as for the rest of my skin on my face I'll have to find other tricks to prevent picking  Thanks   ,F40
I think it's a common misconception and I only really learnt it in the past year  I didn't understand mental compulsions for ages  Always good to learn new stuff ,F40
I started in customer service for ATT wireless but now I'm with a corporate travel company  ,F40
Fantastic video  amazing progress   An amazing life awaits  ,F40
I and most of my friends in DC feel this way  I don't think it's going to be a nation wide phenomenon though ,F40
A lot of sufferers experience a point where they feel like they aren't themselves anymore  I have it as well after a massive attack in February last year  ,F40
Did you try many medications before Prozac ,F40
If you feel it's the right decision then good  I wish you luck ,F40
im so glad that the videos could be of help      and im also glad it worked out for you two   ,F40
I am nearsighted and didn't know I needed glasses for years so I have a headache all the time TIRED and sore eyes     It sucks  But I'm getting glasses ,F40
I've seen it a lot on Facebook as well but it seems mostly to be going around to people who have kids or are around kids a lot  ,F40
Was it my fault ,F40
It might be as simple as that she doesn't want to cause you unnecessary pain ,F40
I stop drinking caffeine at like 5 or 6pm  unless I'm working that late  then I don't   But I take ambien for sleep  which seems to help that problem  ,F40
Just one  Zoloft didn't work for me ,F40
This is a terrible thing to say and  OP  you are 100  not at fault  It doesn't matter if you were drunk  they took advantage of you and you are NOT to blame in the slightest  ,F40
Yeah it's tough to manage different aspects of your life   Try to take it one step at a time   It's okay if you can't do everything at once   Good luck ,F40
Yeah  we have a vet appointment in two hours  I'm hoping my version of very sick is the vets version of easily cured     Sorry to hear about your poodle  I'm sure they were a good pup ,F40
Does eye contact give you anxiety   since its only the ladies that are doing it ,F40
You're so cute  great vid    I see in a post you traveled with only a backpack  I'd love to see how you packed  Packing give me huge anxiety  I'd love to learn to pack light ,F40
You'll get the hang of it and once you do  your whole life will be better and your social anxiety will diminish a lot  Its about learning to rely on people and trust people  and yourself  ,F40
We will have to see if it's the food or just his sickness  I don't know  Worried ,F40
I'm 45 and you are my inspiration  This year I'm going to at least take a road trip somewhere instead of just going to work and home  Thank you  ,F40
and I'm sorry  I wasn't trying to make you feel down or like its not a safe place to  voice out frustrations  but I also didn't want to reassure you  I'm sorry it was stressful  but you did great,F40
I'm so  so sorry  this was not your fault  You are not a slut  Please be gentle with yourself  and if you can  consider seeing a doctor or a therapist  RAINN org has good support available via phone or instant messaging ,F40
Hopefully everything goes well with the vet  Please update on your Kitty's condition ,F40
I'm totally crying over here cuz this is amazing  Your happiness comes across in the video and I can't help but be so happy for you ,F40
"Yeah  I've got some stories in the bag     including ""that time I got uber scammed by some drunk russians""  ",F40
I think it's good practice for small talk  I think I might try it one night  but put on a different persona    the charismatic version of me  just for practice ,F40
I will  Only an hour before we go   ,F40
Ok I'll look into it  do you recommend certain types of school like cyber school ,F40
You're not contagious until you v or have d  And even then  the virus can only be spread through feces or v particles ,F40
I have intrusive thoughts as well  don't google stuff   1 rule is do not google stuff  Also remember you are not your thoughts  as horrifying and disturbing as they might be  it is only thoughts  ,F40
I wish I had your courage  You're awesome ,F40
yes totally  You should start psychotherapy if you have not already  Dont lose hope  there are ways out of this  ,F40
Hey  follow up  I went to the doctor  they made a bunch of tests to me and it turned out im healthy  It was anxiety  purely psychological  I knew it  Im afraid ill live my life like this  Having fear ,F40
I'm the same  I fear making phone calls  I'd rather text  But when I can't avoid it I panic ,F40
Thank you very much  Your answer gave me some confidence  and I'll try once again when I see him this weekend  and if I can't do it  I'll do as you said ,F40
The Reddit community has some over the top ultra liberals  It also is full of trolls that move around subs to see what type of havoc they can wreak  Don't let it get to you  It isn't worth it  ,F40
I suffer from this too  Check out r CompulsiveSkinPicking   whole subreddit dedicated to this   ,F40
Public speaking is a big hurdle for people who don't have anxiety issues    win for sure ,F40
It's nice to know I'am not the only one,F40
Well it took me untill I could live with it and it faded away but i still have rare moments when i'm triggerd,F40
For the benefit of others here  you were banned for advocating the murder of all pedophiles  ,F40
"That is awesome that you are pushing yourself  Freeways are tough because you are ""trapped"" between exits    I know that fear well  And   It gets easier from there ",F40
this video confuses me so much ,F40
Additionally  I see you're a mod of r documentaries that is apparently now stalking through my profile and attempting to harass me in a sub for survivors of sexual abuse ,F40
I thought many stomach viruses were airborne ,F40
I have always  always wanted to go to Europe  Maybe one day    ,F40
That's some good sauce  ,F40
Thanks  that helps a good bit  I just try and distract myself as long as possible from them,F40
39 and haven't done a damn thing worth mentioning yet   Fml lol,F40
So inspiring and you're happiness is so adorable  I loved this  Might have to take a leaf from your book some day  Well done and congrats x,F40
Thank you  I still have 800 mg ibuprofen but running low  Hopefully they'll approve a refill ,F40
you literally have to swallow someone's vomit or feces particles to catch norovirus ,F40
This sounds like a wonderful,F40
I think I understand what you're trying to say  I'll try to find a therapist and find out by myself if my brain will cooperate   Thank you for taking the time to answer me  It helped a lot ,F40
Great  I hope to be able to do this some day  Yay for accomplishments ,F40
I talked to my relatives when they were over last night  instead of just reading while in the room with everyone like I would normally do  ,F40
Sorry you're going through this too  I've just been a huge ball of anxiety about going into work tomorrow and it's been really stressful  ,F40
Maybe  I don't typically look into his mouth   P   But yes  I know exactly what you mean about the what ifs  However  I'm sure that you will be fine until your appointment  ,F40
Nothing to say other than I am the exact same  It sucks,F40
Literally impossible if you haven't been exposed to the virus  And believe me  you'll know if you're exposed to it ,F40
Thank you so much ladyorchid  I hope that your work week proves to be less stressful and anxiety provoking as you anticipate  ,F40
Makes sense that it's the case on the west coast too  It probably won't be in super conservative southern states though ,F40
This is such a perfect description  ,F40
Okay sweet  Thanks so much,F40
You're strong too  Seems like the holidays have been a big trigger for a lot of people  All we can do is take it one day at a time and keep working to improve  ,F40
That's pretty reassuring  I'm hoping the same will happen to me  It makes enjoying life slightly difficult sometimes  ,F40
Yay  congrats  that's awesome   D,F40
Facts get in the way  huh ,F40
That's great    you do you     ,F40
that's actually a really beautiful description ty   i see it now for sure ,F40
I sure hope so  Do you know where his abscess was located ,F40
i try to keep telling myself that   but  ya know  emeto brain ,F40
I'm the same    was meant to take my two years ago     after many lessons but choked    I am afraid of causing crashes literally anything on the road  Driving at night  freeways   ,F40
I am not familiar with that  but that would be extremely helpful  Thanks so much ,F40
I hate touching small objects  especially those made with metal  like coins or jewelry  I also hate their smell ,F40
Oh  I'm glad I'm not alone in this fear  as weird as that sounds  ,F40
Most of them have boyfriends though  and I heard some of them talking about how they don't like me behind my back,F40
eye contact from strangers yes o O,F40
So brave  Great job ,F40
So proud of you  You inspire me   ,F40
I chew the inside of my lips too and the inside of my cheeks  Never realised how common it is ,F40
Rock on girl  You are an inspiration  ,F40
Thanks  I'll give it a try  It really means a lot to have someone willing to listen  ,F40
10 up votes  no comments  Lol  ,F40
I can't promise any time during the night on occasion  but I'm a pretty active texter and always make the effort to get back as soon as possible  I'm 31 f so if you feel comfortable  feel free to PM me  ,F40
No  as long as you've washed your hands and all you should be fine  You probably don't even need to do that  but I know it helps me in those types of situations ,F40
This is super cool  Congrats ,F40
I think it was his back molar  ,F40
This had some great points  ,F40
Well that's no fun  Hope all is well now ,F40
Yeah that's definetly true  I just wish I was enough of a presence to demand respect,F40
Very much so  Yay for dental insurance  ,F40
From Dallas    You are an inspiration  Hope I can achieve inner happiness ,F40
Depending on the area  country city  you should decide to report or not  I guess you should have actual proof  like being harassed in front if people ,F40
nope  political views differ I guess,F40
Yes  It's so hard to take my mind off of it    ,F40
I enjoyed therapy  I wish I could go back  just for the talking and not having to fear to be judged ,F40
Grape juice   ,F40
It's definitely a tough road to go alone  feel free to reach out and PM me if you need someone to talk to  What are your current coping strategies ,F40
Let me know how it goes  I was thinking about therapy too but I'm a bit skeptical as some people say it really helps and others say it's a complete waste of time  Good luck  You'll be fine   ,F40
I eat when I am hungry and hate to eat when I am not  I have been having to make myself eat more recently though because I got out of the habit of eating breakfast and lunch which ended up with me being underweight  ,F40
Try Ativan it works well for me,F40
Hmm If the vet didn't have ideas he might be OK  My sister has a cat that's a drooler  He's totally healthy  Just slobbery  Maybe the respiratory issue is making him drool because he's breathing more through his mouth ,F40
You're a great inspiration thank you for sharing your journey with us  ,F40
I want everyone to be happy  both of egotistical reasons and for the other person's sake ,F40
Touched my weiner  Can confirm I have it  Seems more like a nerve ending or blood vessels  ,F40
I am that friend for someone  Thank you for reminding me how important that is for some people ,F40
What did you do to overcome them ,F40
i had the same thing before  it was a stretch mark,F40
Time to grow up  What does that mean to you ,F40
My body always feels like shit when I spend too much time in bed  I did go to the doctor for reassurance though  that helped a lot ,F40
This is fantastic  I'm proud of you ,F40
Deep breaths in through the nose  slowly exhale through the mouth  Try about 10 in a row  Another option is to look for a good guided meditation or relaxation video on YouTube  Good luck ,F40
yes I feel the same way  my resting state is anxiety  when my anxiety fades  I dont know where to even begin and start getting anxious until i reach my normal anxious resting state where I am somehow more comfortable and familiar  ,F40
Typically the sense of impending doom happens seconds or minutes before they die  You would have been dead if yours had anything to do with health issues  Just paranoia anxiety ,F40
Thanks  Helps a lot  I'll try the YouTube stuff tonight  ,F40
Not really sure  but I have OCD  I think it's another type of anxiety disorder like GAD,F40
Yeah seriously  I mean  I'm over here dreading the idea this is an abscess and will get to my brain  but I couldn't imagine doing so without insurance,F40
I've gone to therapy a couple of times now but it still makes me nervous ,F40
I'm sorry this happened to you as well  I've been talking to my friends and some of them have had experiences like mine  I know it's not like getting professional help but it's a start I think    ,F40
Thanks     ,F40
Mantra sounds good to me I think I'll try that too    Thank you  3 ,F40
If you can concentrate on a book  i'd recommend reading  especially Tolkien or Dragonlance ,F40
Thank you so much I really really hope I will get the hang of it      ,F40
I've tried concentrating on books and that hasn't worked ,F40
Music is another good distraction  if you have any way to listen to some ,F40
I can't sleep without watching something or listening to an audiobook myself  It's like this for a loong time ,F40
The worst part is feeling discardable and disposable  I'm an emotional piggy bank to be drained then smashed once longer useful ,F40
This was not your fault  Please consider seeing a doctor  and speaking to someone   We are here  and we are listening ,F40
I can't listen to music since I can't use my phone ,F40
   I do not have any grandparents  aunts  or uncles   You still probably have some second or third cousins   Your mom is an only child  and so is your dad ,F40
Wow that's really messed up  No therapist should laugh at you  Maybe looking for a trauma specialist would be better if you try again  That's really terrible though  I'm so sorry to hear that ,F40
What a fun  impressive list      Your smile is awesome  I love it  I hope it stays on forever ,F40
I totally do the same thing    end up putting important things off  like bills etc   because I don't want to pick up the phone  It does help  sometimes  to write down the conversation that I want to have ,F40
Even in highschool  other people are a lot less hostile than most people think  Just be friendly and they will be friendly back ,F40
I have a back to school anxiety thing going on and it has been two days    I have trouble sleeping while being anxious as well  so comment to see people's solutions,F40
You're welcome  good luck with everything ,F40
This post spiked my anxiety big time too ,F40
Does anyone really have a friend like that though ,F40
I wish I could give you a hug  I know how you feel  Just breathe  All you can do is breathe  ,F40
Hi OP  you did nothing wrong  If you have anyone in your life you can talk to  please do  If not  you can talk to me  ,F40
Nice job  Cheering you on from the USA ,F40
They should be  by the state  ,F40
Additionally  you're following me around from a conversation about abortion from several days ago   Grow up  this isn't the sub for it  Saying someone deserved being molested is fucked up ,F40
How about trying one of the gifs that shows you when to breathe in and out  Like this  one  https   31 media tumblr com b1406ea40336dc68e5404b380c391d96 tumblr nsj9tcMOgY1qkv5xlo1 500 gif ,F40
Not anytime of the night but someone that will text you back most of the time and they happen to be a night owl like me maybe  ,F40
Thank you   ,F40
What time did you have to get to times sq for NYE  ,F40
the worst is when driving I notice my hands are super sweaty then I get anxious about my ability to handle the wheel in an emergency situation  ,F40
thank you so much  i honestly really appreciate displays of empathy even if they are online  It means a lot ,F40
I wish you all the best and if you ever need to talk I'm here for you   ,F40
Although I want to have someone to talk to I just don't have a clue what to talk about with them  To me that's the most frustrating part and why I can't keep in contact with people ,F40
Thank you  thank you very much  I will share the article with her father as well  ,F40
I can completely relate to this  If you ever need someone to talk to  feel free to PM me   ,F40
I honestly dont know if friends like that exist  would be awesome though  I kind of had a roommate like that in college  but it was mainly bc he would never sleep and text me random texts while i was sleeping  I miss that canadian bro,F40
Pm me and we can talk  I'm 23 male ,F40
Definitely agree  though I was so friggen bummed out today from it   2 hours  and only got just shy of  7   Hopefully tomorrow evening goes better   At least I got a ton of great pokemon in pokemon go   P,F40
Benzo's are way to extreme on the comedown for me   Did you notice comedown anxiety on phenibut   I've considered trying that at the right dose and as a one off on special occasions   It seems to get mostly positive reactions when used correctly ,F40
I don't have advice but I have a lot of sympathy  It's the same here  My worst anxiety trigger and my strongest anxiety symptom are the same thing ,F40
Thank you  It has given me a new lease in life  I think it is here to stay ,F40
Look up derealiztion it could be that  I have it  ,F40
I relate  I feel bad turning down the invitations to parties  but feel worse going to them and not feeling comfortable and leaving early  The cycle ensues,F40
Thanks  it helps just to know that I'm not the only one  I mean I know I'm not  but the positive vibes certainly help  ,F40
I have 1 like that  Females seem to be best for this  ,F40
He doesn't drool if we don't touch him so he might just need some time     I'm just worried that we will have to return him because then I would feel downright awful    ,F40
Sounds like you may have anxiety  If it was really bad you could go see a doctor  If you have a cold with a stuffy nose it might make it worse because breathing right is a pretty big deal with anxiety  Just my thought  ,F40
Yes it does  ,F40
I just came to this sub looking for the same thing  I saw a few online that looked promising  specifically joyable  I don't have the money to pay for sites like that but if you do it may be worth looking into  ,F40
When you're anxious your breathing becomes very shallow so try some deep breathing  Also make yourself some toast  I don't know why but toast is comforting ,F40
Is it anxiety  I have the same issue related to coffee  acid reflux  and post nasal trip  It's aggravated during certain seasons too ,F40
Thank you  I'm really hoping it goes well ,F40
Ive never tried meditation and to be quite honest I don't completely understand it  Would you mind telling me about how you meditate and how it works ,F40
I'll do that  Thank you  ,F40
I will  My therapist gave me her phone number as a means to contact her or ask questions  ,F40
Thank you so much  I really needed to read something like that  I really appreciate it ,F40
That's some good advice  thank you  I'll try that next time I'm in a similar situation,F40
I think they have moments of inaccuracy  if you are talking about the wrist ones  Mine would have moments where it would spike to 150 or something crazy while just sitting down  and my heart body felt normal the whole time,F40
You're most welcome  Don't hesitate to reach out   ,F40
She gets how i hate parties and she doesn't want me to have a bad time but I don't want to force her to stay home or make her leave her friends just because of me  I stuck out the night for her  ,F40
Also this http   www holisticonline com Pets pets 5 ways to meditate with your dog htm,F40
I'm sorry this happened  Keeping up with reporting and blocking seems to be the best solution    I wrote out a story asking for advice  I got a creepy message  I ignored it and deleted my post immediately  ,F40
Some of those would bother me too  You're not alone  Today my gf breathed onto my dinner and I had to throw it out but she didn't understand what she did    Other people aren't going to get it unfortunately ,F40
It definitely makes it go away to an extent I won't lie  Not completely  but eases the symptoms a bit ,F40
Pinched nerve  Get up and stretch and walk around a little and see how it feels ,F40
the nausea you're feeling is almost entirely anxiety  and maybe because of your diet  You'll probably never vomit unless you come down with a stomach virus or food poisoning  but try not to obsess over that ,F40
Hopefully he will get acclimated soon  He'll probably be harassing you to pet him soon  just like my cat     ,F40
Distract yourself with happy videos  things that will make you laugh    Are you thinking about taking a trip   Do some daydreaming about that  ,F40
Yes  It makes you not care and feel dead inside  ,F40
Maybe I'll start implementing them in my diet  or maybe start to eat more spinach  But I thank you for your advice ,F40
In a similar situation  Great to hear good news for someone  ,F40
Muscular pain from constant video games  ,F40
I actually did the exact same  I'm surprised I'm not the only one  p,F40
That explains it i have been laying down since new years a lot  ,F40
Yes this happens to me all the time I second guess everyone and wonder if they are telling the truth and I keep asking and asking for reassurance that they are not lying to me ,F40
In that case  I'll definitely look towards supplements  I actually bought some not long ago  They're 250mg  but I'm not sure exactly how much to supplement  if I'm honest   Edit  says one tablet daily with meal  That works  haha ,F40
If you're a girl then I'm down lol,F40
It is NOT your fault   It was sexual assault   ,F40
I really do hope so   ,F40
I take 400mg a day  The only side effect to magnesium is that it can loosen your bowels a bit  so I'd recommend taking it when you'll be home until you know how it'll affect you    ,F40
I'm not religious but if I don't pray every night or do a cross three times   EXACTLY THREE TIMES  whenever anxious something really bad will happen to me ,F40
yes   reading before bed does the trick ,F40
GG to that buddy  Keep it up,F40
Yea according to Dr  Google  everything is cancer haha  I've been there don't worry  But I would look into those three things  ,F40
Thanks a lot I will definitely do that   ,F40
Stress can cause ulcers  Irritation can cause ulcers  Many things can cause ulcers  Just because you have an ulcer does not mean you are deathly I'll  Avoid acidic foods for a while  be nice to your tummy  ,F40
There is no multiplicative nature to radiation exposure and your phone  You will be fine ,F40
I ask my wife to do stuff like this but I don't think she understands  I get crazy anxiety that I'm going to sound like an idiot or fuck something up  You're not alone  ,F40
Do it  It helps  A lot  Like   A   Lot    Haha  For real  Best decision i made  Probably need to head back  ,F40
Oh I see  Thank you for explaining ,F40
Thanks so much for your advice  Very helpful   I just don't really get your definition of narcissism  I can't really comprehend it  Sorry   Anyway I will  Thanks for the concern   Edit  Do you mean taking things personally ,F40
Jealous    My anxiety automatically cancels me out of the dating world  No guy would  or should basically  want to date a nervous  depressed  weirdo like me  ,F40
Have you got your hormones checked out yet  Alot of these issues can stem from hormonal imbalances ,F40
I'm a guy   and I'd be happy to be your friend  I've been looking for a friend I can depend on like that as well    ,F40

I did that with Skyrim    ,F40
Specifically  which hormones  Can you post a link with information  ,F40
I can feel hopeless out of nothing and cry the rest of the night  It's weird and disturbing  when I told my psychologist she said that I should also mention it to my psychiatrist to see if it could   should be fixed with meds,F40
The fastest way would be to cut off all contact  But it's also the hardest one I guess,F40

I totally feel you here  really early morning right now but I keep procrastinating going to bed because I'm to anxious  Wish I had some words of advice other than try to get to bed a lot earlier,F40
Thank you for sharing this  My girlfriend is helping me with my anxiety and depression issues but she hadn't had much experience with either until we got together  We are working on a plan together for it and this will help a lot ,F40
Holy crap  yes  I'm back to throwing up and screaming while either getting ready in the morning or in the bathroom before my shift  ,F40
Relatable    first commentor is shadow banned btw ,F40
Does anyone else keep confusing this sub and r introvert with r me irl,F40
The sad thing is    I do less than he does  ,F40
Yes  me too  I have been taking baths and that does help me a little  but I'd love to see other peoples ideas  Hang in there ,F40
Plus  it's probably illegal for him to have them  especially if OP can prove he coerced her into sending them  ,F40
You really could have helped somebody in trouble  You did good   D,F40
That sounds like a very unpleasant experience  You did the right thing by calling for help  although it's understandable if you felt too numb or scared to do so  I wish you and those neighbours  including the couple  all the best in healing ,F40
I am proud of you  That is a huge step  I hope the rest of your year goes well too   D,F40
There's a match out there but he has similar problems  My more successful relatonships have been with girls who have anxiety as well ,F40
I just try to act strong and confident even though i'm screaming on the inside  It kinda changes the other persons actions towards me  Sometimes   ,F40
That's perfectly fine  I went through high school being relatively shut out and I'm in college now pretty much the same  I'm trucking on through and have a few people im familiar with now  ,F40
At the moment I think i'll just be looking for retail jobs to start out with   ,F40
Thanks    I definitely know it's going to be a challenge but it's one that I'm willing to step up to  I wish you luck in your situation ,F40
I thought this was r FunnyAndSad,F40
I believe you are describing a migraine  based on what family members that get them have told me ,F40
You shouldn't feel like an idiot  Your brain hurts  and you want to know why  and what you can do about it  and how worried you should be   You're being the opposite of stupid  you're being rational ,F40
I did that for a while but then being uncomfortable i just learnt to accept it  This can lead to health issues so I strongly suggest you don't do this  ,F40
Thank you  It's just  I know I should be healthy  but there's been all these weird feelings and pains lately  and i'm so scared and confused ,F40
Everyone's got stuff wrong with them   My right side obliques are so much stronger than the left that my hips get pulled out of alignment and it messes up my left knee and ankle ,F40
but do you think what I believe is true or just bullshit  ,F40
I think your concerns are unfounded  unless someone with the right skills is specifically trying to stalk you   And  don't take this the wrong way  buy you're probably way too ordinary for someone to bother   Most of us are ,F40
thanks  that makes me feel a little better,F40
Mmhm  And a lot of what I'm feeling is from anxiety  I just get overwhelmed ,F40
Also  I have no idea who you are   I honestly don't know if you're male or female   Don't even have a hunch ,F40
Which is fine  You don't need to be okay right now  You will be okay again later ,F40
I will  And getting some sleep might help me  because I haven't gotten any at all  So  thank you again    ,F40
Yeh this is great for someone who has no idea how to help someone through a panic attack  Even if you don't have a partner  this could help a friend or a family member  ,F40
Fantastic to hear  I'm traveling through Europe at the moment  Day 9 out of 32  and my anxiety has been dreadful  This is so inspiring   ,F40
The same thing happened to me  I stressed after I read that post  Convinced myself next time I felt that feeling I'd be dead ,F40
Lets all just take a moment to appreciate the existence of cereal  ,F40

I was expecting  this  http   m imgur com HhFkkLo r  ,F40
Thank you for this  I woke up this morning read this and now feel so much less anxious about my day  ,F40
It's weird because I used to be strictly panic based  I would have frequent panic attacks   I almost kinda yearn for those days because at least it wasn't constant ,F40
I already tried that  but the problem is that she keeps coming into my mind  because I am so used to it  Can't get her off my mind  ,F40
Thanks for this    sorry that you're dealing with it as well,F40
My mom has decided to take him back  so yeah,F40
I'v had it since February 2016  it's is honestly pure nightmare  But just remember it is not dangerous in anyway  But with anxiety it really feeds the loop  I sent you a PM with a link to a guide to help you through it  ,F40
You definitely did the right thing  ,F40
The question here is    which one of us is the clone ,F40
What device are you actually using  I've worn 3 different heart rate monitors at the gym one day while doing this free training class and they were all drastically different  ,F40
" Link to one on Amazon   https   www amazon com dp 1438008554 ref cm sw r cp apa lW6AybP350NNZ  For those too lazy to type in ""adult connect the dots"" into Amazon or Google themselves   ",F40
That's so cool  I wish my FMIL was as thoughtful and kind  ,F40
Oh my goodness    thats terrible    I hope that it works out for you  hang in there ,F40
"Before you ask  no  this isn't a shady way of saying ""I""  But my friend has a relationship for literallybone day  Now he has hard time getting over it ",F40
That's great to see how assertive you are  even with anxiety under pressure  Just more of a reason to know that you're strong willed and kind     ,F40
You can absolutely get through  I'm so proud of you for getting out and for starting therapy  It will take time but keep at it  Things will get better ,F40
Apple Watch gave me the 178bpm spike while walking  Polar H7 gave me the 17bpm while resting a few hours later  Wasn't using them at the same time  ,F40
I didn't feel anxious that night  but the difference was that that was he most of ever eaten   that  is what makes me question the Ligitimacy ,F40
I got one of these for Christmas as well  They're really therapeutic for me and help reduce my anxiety  Not sure why  but it helps  ,F40
That's a bummer  It's hard not to get attached ,F40
Thank you for this reminder and congratulations   It's so important to remember to take it day by day  and not to be too hard on ourselves  All progress is good progress    ,F40
This is the same way my and my girlfriend are ,F40
You did a really good thing  I hope you're okay ,F40
Exact same experience with Ativan  I would randomly fall into fits of anger and scream at my wife over little things    It was a tough time ,F40
Yes  sadly everything is actually a symptom of everything  Because by this point there is enough cases that enough people have claimed they have had every symptom wth every single disease  All it takes is one google search to mentally crippled someone    ,F40
This is actually super helpful  For whatever reason that last line really reassured me  Thank you very much ,F40
yes  I've had way too many to count ,F40
So far  yeah  I've been with them 3 weeks  and the average seems to be a little over  10 an hour   Probably nothing compared to yours  but I also live in an area that doesn't see a lot of tourism ,F40
Pretty cool  I have a couple good coloring books myself  I'm glad people are rediscovering simple pleasures like this ,F40
What more can you ask for  That's great progress ,F40
Would appreciate it if you could put some context to this  what do they usually expect from you  Also Is it your perception of how all people treat you or is it certain individuals and their particular personality traits that make you feel uncomfortable ,F40
I just got one of these yesterday and I totally agree  ,F40
Yeah  I feel awful,F40
"Totally true  When I'm really keyed up  I feel paranoid  It helps to stop and think ""OK  is there some specific reason I think something is going on  Probably not """,F40
"Can you go ""LC""  limited communication  with your parents   If you are 18  they don't have ANY right to pry into your life   And they will continue to terrorize you as long as they are able to do that ",F40
Thank you so much ,F40
Old College Try is a good one,F50
Thank you  Thank you  Thank you ,F50
I'd also post to  r OpiatesRecovery  ,F50
You got this  friend  I'd already made the decision to not drink tonight and I'll do it with you    ,F50
A stronger man than I could ever be ,F50
After a nasty 5 day binge and extreme anxiety and aches  I will not drink with you today  I am so ready  ,F50
I struggled with very similar feelings  Recently my relapse was just one big denial train  I'm here if you need to talk  ,F50
Honestly staying home is the best option  fuck spending a night with all the new years drinkers  They don't know what the fuck they are doing  I'll be slammin natty ice all night on my couch  about as comfy as you can get,F50
You just echoed what I just posted   you're not alone   If that's any comfort ,F50
Progress made in the last year and one thing I'm hopeful about in the future  ,F50
OMG man  I am so sorry   My friend here says it sounds unusual that he'd be put down for this   Hold out hope     ,F50
Nice one  I'm a kiwi  Where are you hiking  I hope you have a wonderful trip ,F50
I'll either be dead or sober in a year,F50
You find out who your friends are in sobriety  The hard way  ,F50
No problem  Im trying to convince myself that a positive outlook makes things easier  That was just me trying to look on the bright side  Lol glad i could send a smile your way,F50
Hanging out with anyone who is abusing alcohol sounds miserable to me  I avoided people and places that were risky  There's more to recovery than simply not drinking ,F50
So do you know if it's fear of eating associated feeling of physical pain when eating lack of actual hunger ,F50
Thank you  I'll keep that in mind,F50
I will do this  thank you    I haven't had a lot of drawbacks to my drinking  but I know for certain there aren't many benefits either  especially in the long term ,F50
fellow natural ice drinker here  can comfirm    very comfy also love weed too,F50
What's the future like ,F50
Good  glad our experience can be of assistance   That's why we are here    ,F50
You're not alone   We are all here ,F50
Party started and I'm doing good  Not drinking with you today ,F50
This is helpful  thank you   Haven't heard of the concept of maintenance drinking  That was definitely me although I would have stretches of time when I didn't drink at all  Nice to know there are others who are similar ,F50
Oh  and not drinking with you tonight  I am a runner and I squat as well    ,F50
True  Facebook too for me  taking a break from social media works wonders sometimes ,F50
I won't be drinking tonight  ,F50
I was definitely thinking about that for tomorrow  I have some free time  Tonight i dump the smokes in water before bed   ,F50
can't beat the 6  and 50 cents a can my man  wishin I had some ganja too though,F50
Have a safe and Happy New Year ,F50
Ohay automod   3 I knew we hired you for a reason ,F50
This is strangely aggressive  especially since you don't know the friend  Lol,F50
Congrats  Thanks for letting me see into the future  ,F50
I will not drink today ,F50
Happy New Year PG  I'll be on and off of here tonight  Mom's sick  Hope you have a nice evening ,F50
Thank you  I'm glad that I can find support in thus group  I've noticed improvements already  I just have had a hell of a week,F50
Breaking Bad is the best  I'll check out Red Oaks  ,F50
We can do it ,F50
I would also like to know the answer to this  Help me OP wan kenobi   ,F50
What sounds boring is hanging out with intoxicated people  I'd have more fun at home alone with a book or Netflix  ,F50
Happy New Year to everyone   I will not drink today  or even past midnight ,F50
I pay 2 50 for a forty so a little bit more  I have one joint of some serious dank and a few grams of garden weed  Gotta fill my jars up ,F50
Its 7 15 here  and I've had my PJs on for a while  It will be sooo nice to wake up in my PJs instead of my alcohol cig  smoke smelling clothing  Not drinking with you tonight   ,F50
Yeah I'm in the same boat as you pretty much  Just me myself and my inhaler lol  What state are you in  Mass  ,F50
Checking in  it's going well  I have alcohol in front of me but don't feel like drinking it  Dr  Sinclair  thank you  ,F50
Alright I'll bite   Lemme get a pic of the leggings ,F50
I've looked everywhere and I can not find a 40 of natty ice where I'm at  Only the natty light  but whats the point of that  only 4 2   My 40 of choice is hurricane  8  and smooth af,F50
Sign me up plz  Let's do this ,F50
Sign meh up plz  Got a one day streak already lol,F50
A lot of great suggestions so far  I particularly like this one  I can't imagine any other of the 24 meetings there today will have used it,F50
Kudos for starting again  Sounds like you could use more support  Staying sober was difficult to I grabbed hold of all the support I could find  Therapy and AA helped a great deal  Meetings gave me a safe place to go where people understood  ,F50
Hey hey hey  I don't have much to say  You may feel lonely  but you're not alone  I'm a little late to reply  but so hope you're feeling better by now  ,F50
slurricane    strong enough to start an engine mang   ,F50
"As for ""progress""  Naming only one or two things could be suggested  depending how many people are there  so no one monopolizes  I think we sometimes forget about how far we've come  ",F50
I know the fact that i hate it  i know that i need to change  Just saying  ,F50
It is  Thank you ,F50
Thanks man   just thanks  Read your comment and decided to do just that ,F50
Continue with your actions so he can look to you when he realizes that the problem lies with alcohol  ,F50
Yep    have too  ,F50
Op  https   www reddit com r The Donald comments 5lb3fn depressed alcoholic eats breakfast alone ,F50
Six months sober and my first sober NYE in nearly 30 years  Congratulations to all and to all a safe and happy New Year ,F50
Just drink vodka in the shower with the shower water as chaser  And if we're being honest here fuck the food  That does nothing but slow a night down  ,F50
Lee I follow you closely on SD but rarely respond    thx for your message tonight  I'm lost in Cincinnati and very alone right now ,F50
An inspiration  Ringing in the New Years with that monkey off your back  I was suffering a lot early 2016  I feel like a different person now  Keep going man   3 ,F50
You did it  So happy for you  Let's keep going in 2017  ,F50
Wish I could agree with the two week part  it seemed much easier during the first two than it does now  Regardless  I'm gonna pull through and so are you  We've got this ,F50
Awh I love this post  Your little get together sounds like it's going to be a great time  Have a very happy new year  and a happy birthday too  Thank you for sharing  ,F50
No  Let's all go the fuck to bed    its the safest place for us  Well for me anyway ,F50
To be fair  I've lit cigarettes backwards while stone cold sober  it still sucks,F50
Over 25 wasted  wasted New Year's Eves  I agree 100 ,F50
Congrats   Have a peaceful night and a happy New Year ,F50
Oh no   I'm sorry to hear that   I'll glad she has you   Sending Cyber Hugs ,F50
Congratulations  My first sober NYE in over 25 myself  Happy New Year ,F50
I love the activity in this sub the past few hours  Fuckin cheers  pal ,F50
I am pretty happy because I have two handles of whiskey  My dog  My cigarettes and horror films  This is the best NYE I would hope for ,F50
Well done    When you wake up you'll be refreshed and feeling great  Great post  Happy new year,F50
20  is a far cry from 0   No one said it would be easy  But  those are way better stats than I was expecting  ,F50
What a great evening  which will quietly transition into the first sober day of the Year   I'm with you ,F50
Wonderful start to the New Year  Wishing you joyous and sober 2017 ,F50
Good to hear  stay sober  squirrel ,F50
Challenge yourself  but take it one step at a time   ,F50
Great job the way you handled this   crying instead of drinking    Well done and be proud of yourself   I think you'll be moving on friendship wise when you want to ,F50
I had dreams for months  The relief that I didn't drink was so great that I kind of miss the drinking dreams  Stay strong and enjoy this sober New Years with me ,F50
I will not drink today ,F50
Thank you  you too  ,F50
https   imgur com FaFDBJG  I don't know why my legs look two different sizes  and no  I don't normally dress in obnoxious neon bullshit  My roommate gave them to me when we were both fucked up recently ,F50
I'm trying to quit so I can pass a drug test to be a firefighter EMT     How can smoking be more important than that  I hate who I've become sometimes  Sounding so weak  I need to stop   I will stop ,F50
In the same boat my man  ,F50
That's wonderful  Starting the New Year off right  And I'm sorry you're not having the greatest evening   hang in there ,F50
She is on disability so she has some form of medicare  ,F50
When I got out of rehab  I watched Breaking Bad in under 7 days  I'm now starting Breaking Netflix ,F50
Maybe not malintent but definitely misdirected  ,F50
Love it   ,F50
I think a big factor in this is how long you have been drinking that amount  Could you let us know how long it's been  And best wishes,F50
Yes   Smoked my last one at 11 50pm  crushed the rest of the pack and threw it out  I'm done  We can do this   ,F50
I agree  I'm particularly bothered that I wasn't even given the option to come  And not that he was particularly concerned about my sobriety  he just didn't want me  gasp    the alcoholic   to end up drunk at his party  ,F50
I'm a big Giants fan too  Where you from ,F50
awesome work to those you stayed clean throughout this year ,F50
NC  Part of the reason I think I have the fuckin cold  The weather can't make up its mind here  we go from 28 70 in a day sometimes ,F50
Clinks your nonexistent champagne flute  My first sober NYE in 28 years  Cheers to us ,F50
NDV      Woo  ,F50
This made me smile     ,F50
You to     Let's rock 2017 ,F50
My emotions were a roller coaster the first few days          Have any CBT  grounding or anxiety tools ,F50
Been drinking in general since I was 19  i just turned 24   I started drinking this much about 2 years ago,F50
"I agree with you  OP is mad for being abandoned and ""left out "" but at 37 days I can't imagine going to a NYE party where everyone is drinking  I think the friend truly had OP's best interest in mind here  ",F50
"Where are you located  My ""friends"" kind of pulled the same stunt  so if you want someone to chat with and ring in the new year  I'm just going to be hanging around",F50
Oh wow I had no idea there was a survey  sure am glad a post finally brought it to attention ,F50
Happy new year  ,F50
I don't think you damaged your brain    Current neuroscience has found that simple things like exercise and group therapy can have a profound impact in healing the brain   ,F50
There is no try  there is only do or do not  watching starwars right now    Seriously though  if you want to quit then you're going to need to quit completely  Delete your dealers number ,F50
What happened to months 6   7  ,F50
I think that is your old username  Anyways    I know who you are ,F50
I will not drink today  ,F50
You hit the nail on the head on all points ,F50
A side note  I haven't been able to quit  Be better than both of us  For me and yourself ,F50
I can't wait to see how I feel next New Years  Happy you feel different this year ,F50
"Ugh the number of shitty things I've done because ""New Years"" or ""St Patricks Day"" or  y'know  just ""Friday""    We made the right choice tonight for sure  ",F50
You know who I am  I'm not sure if I should be more worried about that or what tomorrow is gonna bring ,F50
  I know AA doesn't really take the holidays off  but in your experience  is Al Anon the same   Al Anon meetings would follow school closings during bad weather  that I do know ,F50
When my aunt died this last year  I immediately felt grateful for AA and meetings  In light and in tragedy  sobriety is amazing and I feel fortunate to have it  I will not drink with you today  ,F50
Man  I wish there was a way to get more awareness out      p,F50
If it's just ashes I'd still drink the beer ,F50
Started today so as not to be hungover in the morning   Start the year off right   ,F50
Beautiful southern Nevada  My girlfriend has an inhaler  I'll be hitting the shit out of it  Haha  How are you  Still coughing up lungs ,F50
Relapsed on the 29th  went on a two day binge  Been clean today  but I got  10 that I'm trying not to spend on a bag  ,F50
I won't drink with you    ,F50
I would venture to say those folks that made those negative remarks are either in denial themselves or cannot understand where we are coming from    Glad you're here  ,F50
Let yourself cry  it's ok   You don't have to know how to get past this moment  this moment will get past you   I'm here holding space for you ,F50
Good on you  It's hard but have that strength  Since I've stopped drinking  waking up not feeling like shit is amazing  Keep it going  Keep it strong  We've all got today ,F50
I've smoked skoal out of a bong on a dare  ,F50
Yeah i somehow still got a cough  Its not terrible but I still have this gross shit coming out when I cough  I'm just physically beat too  So tired all the time ,F50
Hi  I would just like to ask if you are me  I'm at a year clean tomorrow and I filled out my time exactly the same way  Only difference is I taught my ferret to walk on a leash ,F50
It just sucks when you have no money after rent and bills,F50
Tbh I've been seeing this shit for weeks but didn't notice today was the last day  I half assed did it on my phone just now but would have done it more thoroughly if I were near a computer  ,F50
OP please do this  ,F50
I'm home from spell early  Sober  Maybe going to a guy frowns house I haven't seen in years  probably will get flaked on  So I'm a little antsy to see what will happen,F50
Happy New Year  u Phredex     I'm safely tucked up in bed  tummy full of nibbles and soft drinks after spending tonight at home with my three lovelys  Night night x ,F50
Take care out there  We're only a few taps away on your phone if you need to check in again  Hang in there  ,F50
Isn't it nice when at 1 am you're not who they're looking for   Great job ,F50
Congratulations   Welcome to sober 2017 ,F50
I know I'm not far along  but I sent my boyfriend off to his NYE party and I'm in my pajamas playing the Witcher 3  I'm okay with this    However  I'm super tired and might not make it to midnight lol ,F50
Is there a non alcoholic option for a toast ,F50
So like  come hang out with me and we can walk our animals together  Sounds like a good time to me   Also congrats on a year clean  That's such a long time ,F50
Congratulations on your first soberversary  this is great news   Wishing you a fantastic 2017 love n hugs x,F50
Sounds like a good plan ,F50
Hi  are you OK ,F50
If I didn't feel 100  solid I'd leave  Because I know that if I do something I'm just 99  sure of 100 times I'll fail once   It's the difference between gambling and investing  ,F50
Welcome  You've got one hell of a journey ahead of you  Just remember that it's worth it  and so are you ,F50
Boy it sure did for me   It took me about 3 weeks to balance out  although I have to admit I really wasn't good at dealing with anxiety   Turns out its one of those skills I didn't have that I covered by drinking ,F50
Thank you for sharing this ,F50
Are you in any danger   Do you need someone to talk to or do you need emergency personnel ,F50
Fun fact  the concept of peer pressure was invented by cats in ancient Egypt  ,F50
Congratulations   Well done ,F50
You kind of look like Negasonic Teenage Warhead  You are rocking it ,F50
What a wonderful idea    Happy new year,F50
Yeah  I can relate to that for sure   Would you care to expand   Also  the chat below is a good real time conversation   Are you in immediate physical danger ,F50
My emotions were a wreck for at least 2 months  It takes time  On the upside  if I didn't like how I was feeling I only had to wait 20 minutes til the next mood swing ,F50
So glad for this special check in  My husband just got home from a long day and opened a beer  For a split second  I wanted one too  But then I remembered why I won't  So  I'm still not going to drink tonight ,F50
Did something bad happen or just a bunch of stuff piling on ,F50
So happy for your post  I am lucky to get almost 6 hours of sleep at night  I would really like more  you give me hope   ,F50
I should have thought this through better  I live in another country  and I usually visit in the summer  So I'm stuck here  but I am not drinking  If things get too bad I'll just go to bed ,F50
Did you go for the evaluation ,F50
Same here  glad to know that I am not alone ,F50
I wouldn't have wanted someone to do this to me when drunk   its not very nice  ,F50
Have you had any success fighting cravings before   If so  what worked for you ,F50
Ok   then it's just a matter of finding a place that takes it  there are hundreds that do  the last time I went I was on disability and have Medicare call the addiction hotlines  do a Google Search  you will find plenty of options,F50
Agree 100   don't think I've ever heard anyone say it's a good idea to be around alcohol in early recovery ,F50
It doesn't sound honest  loving  or kind to me  As bad their behavior sounds  each group is self governed  If the group conscious agrees with that meeting style then it's ok  ,F50
My ferret does get along with cats really well    Also thanks  How much clean time do you have ,F50
Oh no  Sorry to hear   What's going on ,F50
Going to bed early is a great escape route   Best part is that there's always a brand new day waiting on the other side     ,F50
I only passed out in front of my family once  I have some unnamed sleeping condition   ,F50
OK   We would like people to only post when they are sober  out of respect for those who are sober and struggling right now   Can you please try and post tomorrow morning when you are sober ,F50
 drinking fizzy apple juice out of a champagne glass   So this is what the people of Bel Air be livin' like    We've got a bottle of the same in the fridge  Happy NY ,F50
Last year I cried myself to sleep  I hated myself  and couldn't breath properly for weeks  I never want to be in that place again  Hopefully 2017 doesn't suck as much as 2016 ,F50
"Not ""I don't get to drink""  but ""I don't have to drink"" really sat well with me  ",F50
I'm glad you're here   SD has been the kindest  most encouraging group of people ever since I quit lurking  too   Stopping drinking has turned my life around   Happy new year's Eve  and I will not drink with you today ,F50
Did it  Made it through three pubs  two bands  a very disorganised countdown and a semi cautious walk home  Huge huge relief right now  Happy new year guys,F50
A little over six months  Longest I've ever had  ,F50
Lol  That's priceless ,F50
Better than me  last time I got out of detox I lasted about an hour ,F50
I hope you're right about the way you spend NYE   I'm sober  happy  and surrounded by family while participating in a great group of supportive people that take time out to help perfect strangers   Happy 2017 ,F50
I'm glad you did decide to post  I don't think it's ridiculous at all  I've been having squirrely thoughts all day  I'm not going to act on them but they are there  Being here and reading everybody's posts helps so much   ,F50
I won't drink with you today ,F50
I'm wasn't sober  fuck,F50
I think I'll write that phrase down somewhere too   perfect summary  ,F50
I need to do this so badly ,F50
I'm very sorry for your loss   My uncle died last year and I was very grateful to be able to experience it sober   I'll not drink with you  too   ,F50
This is true  Headed out to get all you can eat crab legs with all the money i would have spent on booze ,F50
Congratulations on not drinking   I find that I socialize better when I'm sober  although I was very afraid of that fact   At 4 days I would've been pretty tempted   ,F50
You might die  It's not likely  but it's possible  I was drinking as much or more than you and though I didn't sleep for a few days and was shaking  like a Polaroid picture  I didn't die  YMMV  of course  ,F50
hopefully not too late again but im down  ,F50
You won't regret it  I won't drink with you tonight ,F50
Why did they text that they don't want to talk to you anymore ,F50
Your post is so inspiring  Congratulations on two years   ,F50
Lots of candy tonight y'all,F50
Even at 84days i don't think I can handle being around alcohol  ,F50
Cheers my Sprite Zero to that ,F50
Hot yoga  wow  I've always wanted to try that    Have a great time and Happy new year x,F50
You've got this buddy    More importantly than doing this for a New Years resolution    do this for you    We believe in you   EDIT  do this for you   and your family     ,F50
Heyyy  I'm sick too  Ulcer related I think  Just gonna watch some rifftrax and drink some chicken broth  Cheers ,F50
I'm alone and not drinking  Beats the alternative  I will not drink today ,F50
Congratulations on 2 months   Sorry to hear about your mom and your best friend  but great job staying strong   Happy 2017 ,F50
So happy I resisted and held strong through both Xmas and nye  I'm sure many many here also did so and I am so happy about that   Bring on a bright new year  ,F50
So happy I resisted and held strong through both Xmas and nye  I'm sure many many here also did so and I am so happy about that   Bring on a bright new year  ,F50
You're not alone  we are here with you  ,F50
"This has to be the best ""scare the nicotine out of you"" video out there  ",F50
Thank you for all the motivation ,F50
"Hearing from you ""from the future"" is really encouraging  thank you ",F50
Thanks  Feels kinda cool  PM anytime if you'd like to chat  Happy New Year,F50
Hey  Could try the chat  it's in the sidebar and pretty busy tonight  I think putting your sobriety first is great ,F50
Maybe that was terrible phrasing  My mom was my best friend  Only lost one    ,F50
Again I highly recommend the reading  I can completely relate to the problems you share and even though you are a woman the book is basically about relationships regardless of gender  ,F50
Your friend was looking out for you ,F50
What a great way to ring in the new year ,F50
Playing WoW  I played for a long time before I started drinking and also played for the 5 years I was a daily drunk   It's amazing how much better you are at a video game when sober ,F50
That doesn't sound very kind  Pretty damn mean if you ask me  ,F50
It's not for him  it's for my sister  My question is whether or not her father  whose currently struggling with substance abuse  should be present and actively participate in her intervention ,F50
I'm quitting smoking starting today too  and it feels like hell on earth  but I know it's going to be worth it after a few month  Good to know I'm not alone,F50
On NYE probably good call to stay in and watch tv  When I think of any point to this holiday other than an excuse for excessive drinking  I draw a blank  ,F50
Kinda bored  having to remind myself why I quit to begin with  This will be my first sober NYE in 31 years  I can do this  Fuck the zero ,F50
Fierce  Stay Strong  ,F50
Checking in for the final time this month  and for 2016  61 days under my belt  2017  LET'S FUCKING GO   ,F50
I bet you will feel proud of yourself in the morning  Happy new year ,F50
I will not drink today,F50
Thank you  I will do some research on this ,F50
I'm home alone too  This is my first sober NYE in decades  Home is where it's at    ,F50
Do it occasionally  only when horny  never in front of a screen    Best of luck ,F50
"Isn't that the truth  If I don't have enough to get me drunk  why bother  My mom always says ""just have one shot""  As if  ",F50
"That sucks   Not sure what to say that would make it better except that your courage in posting that and staying sober should make you realize you are built of sterner stuff than your ""friends""   I will not drink with you today ",F50
I did this last year  it took till mid march  For me to finally quit  ,F50
You're not alone  friend    we are all in this together ,F50
I'm so so sorry for what you're going through  it makes me so sad and you don't deserve this      ,F50
Not alone  and it's going to be so worth it  ,F50
Today is day one for me for the same reason  I couldn't justify putting it off any longer  Best wishes to you  ,F50

Good call  So worth it ,F50
Congratulations  that's an awesome decision   It's certainly made me the best version of myself   Welcome ,F50
Thanks  I'm super proud of myself for where I'm at in life now  I'm sure you know the feeling too    I'll definitely take you up on that offer sometime     Thanks for being awesome  ,F50
I have been sober since april  however this holiday season has brought with it major stress and anxiety over the smallest things  I can't seem to quiet my mind  I find myself wishing I could escape to drunk land  I'm not drinking with you tonight ,F50
thanks for the recommendation   ,F50
I probably drank 10 20 drinks a day toward the end  What really was bad was the drinking in the morning   sometimes before the sun even came up  ,F50
Not drinking today   Going to a fundraiser and my friend offered to stay sober with me   Will head to my sober boyfriend's as soon as we get tired of the drunks   That might even be before midnight   ,F50
I am home as well  Currently watching some Mickey Clubhouse with my 2 year old son by my side  As many times I have seen this annoying episode  it is still paradise compared to being in a regrettable  rude  smelly  drunken  stupor ,F50
Awesome job on one year  What a great New Year's Eve resolution last year that is still here this year   Great job  you  ,F50
Good for you  A healthy year ahead ,F50
"""Closed"" meeting just means it is for anyone affected by someone else's drinking  Some meetings are held on holidays   The only reason they might cancel is if the building where they meet is closed   ",F50
Wow  That's crazy that cops have to direct traffic  I pray everyone is safe tonight too,F50
Math  Reading a lot  lot  lot  Talking to friends  Drinking killed all of it ,F50
Happy new year  It will feel great waking up sober,F50
Chairs   New Year is 3 hours away from where I'm at  but I'm sure I will not remember shit when it comes around,F50
Curled up with my pups also ,F50

I really like this  Hope is a powerful thing ,F50
Congrats  It sounds like you are doing awesome  Constant self improvement is a great track to be on  ,F50
I've done that a few times  It's infuriating  I stuck it in right but still somehow fuck that up  Especially super drunk  What looks right to me is the wrong end of a cigarette ,F50
That's really shitty  I'm sorry that happened to you  ,F50
Its better than the regular vice ,F50
Your username is fantastic  Got a pretty good chuckle out of me  I think quitting drinking was the first step in the road to constant improvement  I hope I never stop learning new things  ,F50
I'm sorry but what does FOMO mean ,F50
Been arrested  not due to alcohol  Rather not have that happen again  No one likes to be the laughing stock of a jail cell,F50

365 heh  Congratulations  Well done  ,F50
Totally   I assumed it was some type of DUI check because I was not speeding  so I wasn't nervous at all   ,F50
I'm hoping my honesty can reach one person  I lied to myself for so long  Being truthful about my disease is what saved me ,F50
You have some shit to deal with   Booze won't help any of it   If you can keep the sobriety going things should start going your way   Good luck Hero ,F50
Thank you for this post and congratulations on your accomplishments this year ,F50
Thank you all one day at a time,F50
My 'light' days were a bottle and a half of wine  My 'heavy' days and weekends were 2 bottles plus some shots or a fifth of vodka  Once I nearly finished a handle of fireball on my own  Once I pop I can't stop  ,F50
I'm always amazed how much clearer and vibrant the eyes are in these type of posts   Congrats on your new life  You've done an amazing thing ,F50
I've been checking into the plug dj channel  and I for one  think this is a capitol idea ,F50

Happy New Year from QLD  Good on you   ,F50

Woohoo on the weigh in for the end of year and crock pot meal for tomorrow  Win win  Happy new year ,F50

You're braver than I was at four days  Good luck tonight  have fun but stay strong ,F50
Yeah that's true  Some people need to drink to have fun or for other reasons  I don't have to anymore  It's like taking training wheels off a bike  It's really great ,F50
I take lots of my own seltzer water with me to parties these days   Enjoy the party sober  I've come to prefer it ,F50
At least you should have gotten some good mileage on your eggs   I'm assuming you play Pokemon Go from the Charmander in your picture   ,F50

Wooo     Congrats on two years ,F50
I've gone out with friends after I stopped drinking  although not as much   Most people don't seem to care that I'm not drinking   I do find while sober I have much lower tolerance for drunk people though ,F50

A huge congratulations and a sparkling water toast  You're an inspiration to me ,F50
I find it interesting how some alcoholics will say they don't want to go to AA because it's embarrassing  Is that more embarrassing than stumbling home from the bar on the regular ,F50
  7    They like me  They really like me   Either that or I'm just a shit show  I'll take either one ,F50
Thanks  I'm getting there  this is probably the first round of antibiotics I've taken in 5  years that I haven't consumed alcohol on  so I'm hoping my recovery time will be faster lol,F50

Fuck  you know we love you  ,F50
quitting is easy  staying quit is whats hard  because for me if its  not the craving that never goes away  its the health anxiety        Just soldier through it ,F50

"I play a game called ""drink""  The rules are simple    When I open the bottle  I drink it    Whoever drinks wins ",F50
"Just for today  I will not drink  I will    	 Nourish myself with reading  meditation and food 	 Slow down during my day and keep things simple   Greet every person with the kindness of a long lost friend",F50
Organisms  Ahaha   Yes  life is about organisms  ,F50
I will not drink today  ,F50
It is very great and thanks for the comments stoptrickie  They do think I'm pretty cool    weird     ,F50

You have advanced to LEVEL 2 of the Drinking Game   i e  you win  haha   ,F50
I'm hoping treatment will give me the insight needed to depend on myself to stay clean  Obviously doing it for another person isn't enough  There's too many variables involved  People are flaky and can't give you the necessary support 24 7 ,F50
Checking in on my 5th day  The first day of 2017  Feeling a bit better this AM  Glad day 4 is in the past    I won't drink with you today  ,F50
Thanks for the kind words  and I'm glad it made sense  They went so far as to offer us to stay the night  just being good hosts mind you   it was a total green light situation  ,F50
I won't put myself in that situation again  I trusted myself and also my SO but I've learned that it's best to just not go  I'm very disappointed  I don't judge people for drinking so why am I judged for NOT drinking  It's craziness x,F50
It's a small thing  but I'm really happy that my 2 week badge lined up perfectly with New Years morning  I can't express how much this sub has helped me  You guys are the real mvps   3,F50

Thank you so much for your reply  I suppose I am lucky to be mature enough to identify it now rather than later  I don't want to have to be driven to sobriety by waking up from a blackout with irreversible consequences ,F50

You're doing it wrong  We can get cheaper   1  Cheapest tequila you can find  2  T  J 'so margaritas mix   Done   It ain't good  but it gets the job done ,F50
You could consider asking someone to be a temporary sposor   That way you would have the support until you found someone who you wanted to be permanent ,F50
"I'm confused   You seem to be saying that SSRIs are placebos that work ""sometimes""   As in not just a placebo effect  they are actually medicinal   Though if that were true  they obviously wouldn't be placebos ",F50
Okay  I'm in ,F50
Your typos this morning are on point  ,F50

Checking in  Good luck everybody    ,F50
That's why I'm trying this  I can't keep drinking to numb myself to the problems of the world ,F50
You're a good egg  that's such a nice thing to do     I would rather see someone do that ANY day than have them reluctantly get in some 'tipsy' driver's car ,F50
They get angry because they put up with our shit for so long  I can understand him  Maybe having a little talk with him could help ,F50
Gonna keep trying  till I beat this burden    I will not drink today  ,F50
Your EYES though  This is the number 1 change I am seeing in all these wonderful pictures  Your eyes literally look bigger  Less bags  You de aged ,F50

Alright I'll bring a spare bivvie bag ,F50
Look at you being all global oriented with your metric references  How much is 3ml  I thought there was like 40ml in a shot ,F50
I will not drink today  no matter what happens ,F50
unfortunately  in a lot of states  yes ,F50
It's all good    Orgasms create organisms so it's all connected anyway  ,F50
Same here  It's a wonderful feeling ,F50
I will not drink today  Happy New Year  everyone  ,F50
I was celebrating New Years Day with my girlfriend sober too    ,F50

Welcome aboard  I will not drink with you today  ,F50

I survived the Eve  and will continue to not drink today,F50
Huge congratulations  I hope you're just beaming at waking up fresh to a new year    My own story is a bit different but I really identify with how severe and awful it sounds like it got for you    With you sober today,F50
New York sounds cool  but as a European  we often hear about how it is a cesspool of crime and urine smell    So which is it  I thought NY was pretty safe these days  is that true ,F50
My manager called me because a coworker called in    I did not answer  They do not pay me enough to walk all the way there and back on my day off with 10 minutes notice  ,F50
"Really hoping this year will be the year I can finally make it and become ""clean""   Best of luck to all of you ",F50

Very very safe these days    It's kind of a police state if you can fall into the warmth of M16's in the port authority  ,F50
That's not a bad idea  although I gotta watch my salt intake so I don't add salt to hardly anything these days ,F50

That sounds like a great night  I avoid movie theaters  Too expensive for something I'll either fall asleep during or just completely forget in the end   ,F50
Yes  you're right   what a great feeling not to have to worry about the simple things  like running up to the store   Thanks Guitarist ,F50
That brings back memories    I used to have a really cool custom made glass spoon back when I was doing that    SO was always bitching that I was ruining our metal spoons so I had my glassblower friend make me one ,F50
The last line made me giggle a little  Good for you  I'm hoping to gain the same inspiration from sub   ,F50
 I shall fear no longer  ,F50
My family have been pretty incredible unsupportive about me getting sober  At a certain point you are getting sober for you and not them  just keep sober and let the results speak for themselves  ,F50
Thank you so much  This is so incredibly helpful for me  I've never dealt with something like this  and I really appreciate the insight  The codependency thing definitely resonates  so I will definitely read that book ,F50

I love this thread  I also woke up with a smile  not a drop of alcohol last night and I feel fabulous today   So happy there are tears in my eyes  ,F50
The one thing I've never experienced are the sweats in the am  I will only sweat profusely if I'm taking a sober day and it only happens when I'm sleeping    It sucks  Wet bedsheets aren't fun ,F50
Nice to have you  I won't drink with you today  ,F50
Thanks for the support  I'm feeling the same way  Wait  are you saying I reset it or not  I'm not sure I follow   Edit  I guess you mean resetting our brains take some time x ,F50
Thank you  I'm not terribly enthusiastic right now  which is probably due to being hungover  hopefully for the last time   But I know things will change as I re learn to live my life without alcohol    ,F50
I was an angry BO  daily drunk for over 2 years  I gave up on apologizing or giving a shit for a bit  I still have all of my friends  I call that    magic ,F50

Hair of the dog for me  some black tea to fight off the caffeine hangover  I'm three weeks in and feel pretty good  Nice to wake up this way  Was a pretty cool and productive last few days ,F50
Angry   no  I find being drunk makes me a far more efficient  friendly and entertaining person  Some of the best decisions I ever made were when smashed to oblivion  The solution to your problem is quite clear   'Don't be a Dick' ,F50
How oddly specific    ,F50
I believe it  and I'm starting to believe that BSO is a must have ,F50
Thanks a bunch and the very same right back at you on 4  Feeling good  right now at least ,F50

I will not drink poison today,F50
She was fine after that  I was just trying to avoid telling everyone I'm an alcoholic so it was embarrassing for me to have to say I can't handle a sip  She was a little embarrassed but very understanding  ,F50

It was such a success  I'm so proud of myself  It's a scary thing because I have to remember I'm still broken  but I did it and things went better than I could have hoped ,F50
Good way to think about it  I'm a New Year quitter and it does sound daunting  Thanks,F50

One thing at a time  one day at a time ,F50
Thanks guys  glad to be here with you  Actually here  not destroying myself    Sorry about the title  on a cell phone and missed my mistake ,F50
"Ha  so true for me  too   When I was still failing at moderating  I thought  ""what if I just drink on Fridays "" And then I realized that drinking heavily 52 times a year was still an awful lot  ",F50
Thanks for the support ,F50
Thank you for your kind words,F50
I don't know much about you sir  but it seems like it may be time for a lifestyle change ,F50
I won't drink with you all today    Happy New Year    ,F50
Did you try tapering off the gabapentin or go cold turkey ,F50
Congratulations   I helped a friend quit around 2016's new year and it's been one year since she last smoked  Surprisingly she doesn't even crave them anymore ,F50
Nice one on remaining sober ,F50
"Every time I drink I go into ""fuck it"" mode and usually just smoke  Didn't this time  Almost 4 months now ",F50
"I'm sorry you had to fend off a yucky comment like that  but it sounds like you handled it like a champ  also  I'm totally stealing ""sugar sweater """,F50
Good luck   I want to stop drinking myself too  Today is day 1 for me too  I have a goal set for now of not drinking at all in January  If I get through that  I'll reassess and hopefully continue for longer  ,F50
Starting at a new company on the 11th  in a manager position that is more demanding than current one so I'm hoping not to smoke up before work like I do now,F50
Sounds like a great start for 2017   I'll keep today sober right alongside you  I love beautiful chilly mornings  especially looking forwards to going for a walk tomorrow   ,F50
Me too  We can do this  Here's to a successful 2017  ,F50
This is basically what I was gonna write  Good on OP for recognising the projection  but god damn  That is not okay ,F50
Same here  Day 1'ers Unite  ,F50
Tapering  Cold turkey was impossible  and still is  Must take 600mg night or else I don't sleep  I just enter a twilight state where I'm aware of everything around me at all times  and thus not unconscious sleeping  ,F50
haha win  I actually feel like kind of a rock star that I have lem commenting in my thread  I'll save the rest for the saturday success thread ,F50
Sure I used to convince myself that I was a high functioning alcoholic  Of course after I got sober a while I realized I was barely getting by and was just deluding myself into thinking that ,F50
nope metal i also got ham not prosciutto though and maybee some bits and bobs ,F50
Perfect  I was an emotional hodge podge the first 3 months  Hang in there  the feelings will get better  and they beat the hell out of homelessness  ,F50
Well  everyone is different    ,F50
When my brother makes fun of my inability to moderate  I make fun of his man boobs  Sibling love is the best  ,F50

Seconding heading over to  a stopdrinking  I also recommend checking out AA speaker tapes  There's some amazingly inspirational stuff there spoken by the people who lived the stories  I don't go to a lot of meetings but I always enjoy listening to the stories ,F50
So happy not to be drinking today ,F50
If youre hyperactive stop being lazy and go exercise till youre sweating like a pig dont be an asshole  theres no excuse for cheating   Whilst shes away I recommend gradually reducing the quantity you smoke for the 1st week and quitting entirely on the 2nd  ,F50

Welcome and good on you for speaking up   Do you have an idea of how you're going to approach things ,F50
They were real  And if you think about it everything is just a memory some are just newer therefore more visceral  ,F50
I had a dream that my best friend and I were smoking a blunt on stage at a high school talent show while playing music and the principal was pissed  It was weird  But yes we can do it ,F50

Sorry bud  It's just the truth  Maybe it's just me  But I'm telling you what I experience ,F50
There is a saying that a miracle is something that is above nature  supernatural   It is also said that to receive the miracle you too must ascend beyond nature ,F50
Thank you  I've been recovering for a long time from a difficult surgery  so having the energy and motivation to set up my workspace is wonderful  ,F50
Functioning drinker to me was a window  I was doing fine while drinking so there was no worry or concern  Then it progressed to blackouts and being unable to stop  Had to stop,F50
Sure  i'll pack on another 365 with you  ,F50
Fantastic   One of the hardest things for me is getting back into the projects I love   Care to share what you're working on ,F50
Thanks friend  Being sober is the best gift I've ever given myself  I'm gonna keep on keeping on ,F50
Oh of course this is one reason I quit  cos I knew it was only a matter of time be it months  years  decades  before I reached that stage ,F50
I was spending too much money  gaining too much weight  and I disliked the foggy head that I'd get 3 4 times a week from it  It disrupted my sleep a bit  too ,F50
Don't know about you dude  working out makes me even more horny,F50
Yup  alcohol will do all those shitty things when you drink in excess  Glad we're not drinking today    ,F50
How long has it been since you smoked  ,F50
What bothers me the most is my brain automatically assuming a cigarette is coming   My hand checks my pocket   Where did I put my   oh no,F50
I went over this    ,F50
I took 4 500 mg day for 3 years  So I'm certainly big pharma's guinea pig ,F50

Best of luck to ya  but I'd imagine making a living off it would be a bit destructive   Constantly taking orders for shitty whitisms that like a tide against rocks slowly erodes your joy of casual disdain ,F50
Happy 2017  everyone  I won't drink with you today ,F50

Day three I think  Honestly this withdrawal is really light  Considering getting more before the end of the break though  Just bored as hell  ,F50
I'm thinking of you too  I really admire that you're staying strong and sober despite your mood right now  Keep strong  You've taken a huge step to improving your life  I'm not drinking with you today  ,F50
I wake up on the floor near my small computer desk  and start drinking again and the next thing I know   a week has gone by   No more ,F50
Did they just assume you were because you were in a jovial mood  and because they probably couldn't tell the difference  being drunk themselves    Funny     Good work not being tempted   Tell us how you did it ,F50
Did you do it   Do it ,F50
Opiates absolutely diminish libido and once you're to the point of shooting opana  that IS your sex life ,F50
Checking in  It's raining outside and I'm home alone  but staying strong  Happy New Year everyone  ,F50
This is good advice  ,F50
It feels so good to be the responsible one  doesn't it   Excellent share  and good job on continuing your sobriety into the new year ,F50
Not going to drink with anyone today   Day one     ,F50
Ohhhhh fuck     ,F50
Thx  any additional advices  I thought about transfering from gaming PC to a laptop    some say it helps  some say not  The laptop would have a weak components if I would buy it ,F50
I for one definitely want to quit forever  I don't need weed to relax  Actually  as a matter of fact  weed doesn't even relax me  It makes me tense as all fuck ,F50
It's a worse idea to use mega doses of Imodium  There's a growing number of cases where people experience permanent heart disorders from Imodium  ,F50
Its still part of the immersion  I remember spending hours and hours watching MMO Starcraft videos ,F50
Don't take it personally ,F50
What's the 30 day book ,F50
Strong work right here ,F50
Oh  you   At least gorging on the sausage and hash browns won't leave you in any embarrassing situations   unless you go into a food coma and take a nap at the table    ,F50
I like to hope if I make it 10 years  off dope that I manage to make a life for myself and don't spend my spare time still sitting in a room talking about my first world problems  ,F50
Lovely  I took a nice walk this afternoon myself  it was raining in the morning   The sheer pleasure of being outside and able to enjoy life clear headed makes the whole thing worthwhile all by itself  Keep up the good work ,F50
I'm with you  Let's take 2017 by the balls ,F50
Strong work on one year  Congratulations ,F50
One day at a time ,F50
so itchy right now   whine   ,F50
Because most people here don't have the ability to use it in moderation ,F50
30mg isn't that high  I've heard plenty of reports going above 100mg  I don't think I have to worry about that especially for short term use,F50
Well done  I hope I'm where you are in a year's time  ,F50
Thank you for your response  I appreciate you taking your time to give your thoughts  I am not involved in AA presently ,F50
  there is really no benefit to drinking that you can not get through cheaper means  Could you tell me a few examples please ,F50
Appreciate the message  Happy New Year ,F50
I don't comment on your posts much but I want to say I read them every day and I enjoy them  You are on the right track and will definitely hit and year   then some  Happy new year ,F50

Congrats to all  Great inspiration for the rest of us ,F50
Haha  that's my new favorite stat   percent of year sober  Happy new year to you too ,F50
Don't waste your time Fash  Dude's always looking for a fight somewhere lately ,F50
Such a good feeling  isn't it   Happy New Sober Year to you    ,F50
Noice  I'm struggling with my additctions  but I hope to join you soon  ,F50
YAY    Happy new years back to you   3,F50
Thanks  Yes  I have been thinking about trips  too  Why not  Carpe diem ,F50
Ha ha ha   That's the funniest thing i've seen all day ,F50
Stayed up later than I should've but still managed to wake up early to catch some football with coffee  It's only 2pm I feel like I still have the whole day ahead of me ,F50
Nope  Still sober   I worked night shift at the hospital  and toasted the new year with my co workers using only sparkling grape juice ,F50
One of my friends insisted he saw me pouring wine into my glass   I'll post a reply here when I've written up my plan,F50
Congrats on your 3 years  ,F50
Congrats on a sober orbit around the ol sun  Keep up the great living ,F50
Good job     We went skiing this morning  We arrived at the mountain at 8  Not many people there  It was a beautiful day that we were able to take full advantage of  ,F50
I already posted because he wouldnt  And what do you know  Not ONE answer except what tim and i were telling him  Curiously he has not responded since i sent him the link  ,F50
Make sure you plan how you'll do things differently when you go back    I did the same thing  Didn't smoke for 4 months while I was away  As soon as I was back I started again ,F50
Thanks for all your suggestions   will be implementing them ,F50
Yay  I made it to 2017  I've got a good feeling about this year and I pledge to start it off on the right foot by not drinking today no matter what ,F50
AWSOME  KEEP IT UP  ,F50
I'm really worried I'll have to get to this point to need to quit  ,F50
There is a We Agnostics group you can Google Smart Recovery  as well ,F50
As a late 30s kind of guy I realize I can be a drunk or sober anywhere  but I do ponder how things might have unfolded differently had I not grown up   attended college here ,F50
Fuck the zero  Never going back to that,F50
So true  I quit for months once and my life was exactly the same as it had been minus the weed ,F50
Good for you    That's awesome   Keep it up ,F50
Slipped up over the holidays but I'm back and motivated  today I will not drink ,F50
merry chrismas ya filthy animal  D,F50
Congratulations  that's fantastic    And an organised garage   That's unheard of ,F50
I met with a doctor  He told me I had a shitty liver  I said to him it was probably because I drink so much coffee  2 months after that  I got sober ,F50
Denial  it's not just a river in Egypt   Denial is SO powerful  I was very sure that my problems had nothing to do with booze  Until I quit  Then the fog cleared and I saw exactly what was going on ,F50
thanks    I understand that booze may not be the best way to deal with feelings but I just don't know any better way,F50
You're probably right  Just stay cautious and don't let loperamide replace your addiction  Good luck ,F50
The thing is we don't know what we don't have until we get sober  You will definitely get more than 7 reasons after you are sober ,F50
Congratulations on 365 days   This internet stranger is proud of you ,F50
Cheers to you      We're in this together  ,F50
Happy New Year  Happy 11 Months  and Congrats on the weight loss   I'm still following your lead     Woohoo  ,F50
Wow  That thought has blown my mind   ,F50
I agree  jusr Basic Alchonomics  what are they teaching in school these days   ,F50
Wonderful thought   ,F50
Thank you  I'll take a look at it  Smoke free from this morning ,F50
Better celebrate making it a day with a long  hard  drag       At least that's what you used to say  Stay on track man you can do it ,F50
Congrats on a YEAR   Happy New Year  ,F50
It seems that most of did the exact same thing  I passes out in front of my family and they were unable to wake me except to take a drink and go back to sleep ,F50
Yep I have  ,F50
Another elusive sober Sconnie here  I spent NYE alone because I don't know any sober people  and I don't enjoy spending time with people who are drinking heavily anymore  Congratulations on 99 days sober ,F50
Needed that today  Thank you for sharing  ,F50
Congrats on 2 years ,F50
Fantastic job  I'm grateful you're here    ,F50
Congrats on a YEAR  ,F50
I'm atheist and Aa is working for me   ,F50
So much this  The badge has been a huge reminder of my success in not drinking  and from others experience it seems to help a lot ,F50
I will most definitely not drink with you today  You got this  ,F50
Chapter one  the beginning to an awesome journey  Good luck ,F50
Cool  I'll try that next ,F50
Alanon meetings helped me find answers to difficult questions like yours  Meetings are almost everywhere    It's a painful decision to cut ties  but you have a right to peace of mind  Meetings helped me find it  ,F50
Checking in  still on track  ,F50
Very good to know  thank you  I didn't have much luck with finding any AA meetings that were local enough today  but did find Phoenix Multisport  which I've heard great things about  Thanks again for your help ,F50
You have a right to live your life  You sound fine to me  It's nice to have friends who care  but there's a fine line between being concerned and controlling  Don't talk to your friends about it if you don't want their opinion  ,F50
Exactly the same here  Seeing lots of people here on day 1 too is making me feel better and motivated  ,F50
 January thread is up   https   www reddit com r StopGaming comments 5lhovg joyful january 2017 commit to not gaming this  ,F50
I'm a woman and an atheist and still found value in AA  The Twin Cities has a multitude of recovery meetings  Generally they are not for any specific age group as you describe  Alcoholism crosses all age  race  gender barriers  ,F50
I will not drink today ,F50
I will not drink today  ,F50
  High Five for 365       1    edit  Accuracy is important where those precious 24 hours are concerned ,F50
Every day it gets a little better ,F50
I'm with you on this one  Btw what creative hobby was it you picked up ,F50
"I am in a similar place but have not gotten to the point where I am ready to quit  My hope is that the medication will help ease some of the symptoms of my depression before i ""leave""  Anything specific get you to making this decision  ",F50
Me too  I will not drink with you today   ,F50
I get this feeling sometimes even with 14 months clean  But I force myself to go and always feel so much better after the meeting  ,F50
Yeah  I am coming to that belief  too   At least chronic daily drug use anyway   Our bodies  minds and souls just have a preference for     well  sunlight food and water and that's about it  ,F50
Congrats on a year  I hope to be where you are at this time next year  Such an accomplishment  I can't imagine all the different emotions you are feeling today ,F50
Good luck  Stay strong ,F50
I mean  my name is Joysticks so it would only make sense  p I would love to join,F50
Thanks for sharing your story with us  and congrats on a year sober ,F50
Absolutely  you're so spot on  In many ways I replaced my alcohol addiction with this obsession over another person  ,F50
You got it  Thanks ,F50
You should write tourist pamphlets ,F50
Your NYE sounds perfect  Not a loser at all  And 100 days tomorrow  That's GREAT  ,F50
Just because you don't remember it doesn't mean had a bad time  ,F50
My hope in life is that someone actually acts rude to my face  I'm all peaches and cream  but step on my toes and the Eastern European in me comes out  It's cute watching people's faces drop as they fear for their lives  ,F50
Great job  Running helped me out a lot too   I'm starting running tomorrow again   Laying in bed now happy that I survived day 1  ,F50
1 1 17  Checking in  clean  ,F50
Lol at sugar sweaters    Congrats to you   ,F50
A therapist was helpful to me  I went to meetings but a therapist gave me a professional to talk with and it was private  I learned a lot about myself and started taking better care of myself  ,F50
Cool reminder why quit and continue not smoking  Thanks ,F50
Happy New Year  I would agree with SOmuch2learn  completely  We all do tend to want to fix each other  Sometimes to forget to just lend an ear  Have a great year  enjoy your new place ,F50
Happy New Year    Well done  Keep up the great work ,F50
Congrats to you   Sober life IS really worth it Things in life you didn't care so much about becomes the most important thing to you Such as your family ,F50
You got this  I will not drink with you today    ,F50
Happy new year  Congrats on the progress and the little one  Keep us updated  please ,F50
So what's your plan   In my experience  it's not enough to not be planning to use   I needed an active plan to keep from using   What  will you change to keep from getting in a using situation ,F50
On my first days I did a lot of sd reading and posting   It kept me occupied and somewhat sane  It worked for me  Do you have a running plan that you will follow  I will not drink with you today  ,F50
Inspirational  well done   ,F50
Haha great to have you ,F50
I guess i have to  too  Struggling with addiction is not something I thought I would ever have to do  ,F50
Being bulimic is never understood by anyone but another bulimic  When I read this I felt every word and maybe for the first time someone feels how I feel  Nice job on this  Words are so powerful  ,F50
I stopped drinking when the pain of continuing to drink outweighed the pain of quitting  While I can think of alternative additional responses  none are as correct or complete ,F50
Sign me up please   ,F50
That's my go to response as well  ,F50
tomorrow night is my quit smoking day  and also my quit drinking to excess night  2017 gonna suck ,F50
Yes and no  That's where I got it but I looked for the source and it may be attributed to Bill Gates in a very different context ,F50
Went to the gym from 11pm 1am so I didn't have to dwell on my sobriety while everyone else was getting fucked up   Felt good  got a great workout in  18 days here ,F50
I wish you were there  that'd have been hilarious  I shy up too easily and avoid confrontation ,F50
that 1000 yard staredown and i think you got a pretty decent boob game to play with  obvillusally i have no idea where i was going with this so happy new barf year ,F50
can i sign up for this now  I havent posted here in a few days and missed the roll call ,F50
Awesome post   Congratulations  ,F50
Glad you're here   ,F50
I really wish I'd not lurked for years  It's really nice to feel supported and able to be honest about my problem ,F50
Glad you came back  Now I'm thinking about how delicious that fresh mint would taste in my herbal tea  ,F50
Hi glad you're here and seeking help  Can you get to an urgent care or doctor  At that level of drinking you may not want to quit cold turkey it could kill you  Once you get sober that paranoia will subside  alcohol causes that  ,F50
Thank you so much for this    ,F50
I was very similar  I needed serious help  It started with a trip to my doctor ,F50
Thank you    ,F50
I'm on the cover  fam  ,F50
"Well  I wasn't ""shocked""  and I wasn't  denying  the problem      I was  refusing to address  it ",F50
Woo Hoo   Great   ,F50
You in the fold or not   Mango  go easy on him  I mean I wouldn't  but whatever  ,F50
How were your dreams before quitting  Were they not nightmares or do you think you can just recall them better now ,F50
High five on 1100 days  Mr Carr made my quit easy this time too ,F50
I hope to hear about your experience   As u SOmuch2learn shares  the only requirement to be there is a desire to stop drinking   You won't be forced to do anything   I hope everything exceeds your expectations in a positive manner ,F50
I meant I don't have to worry about cardiac issues  Haha lighten up man ,F50
Why so angry  Embarassed by the truth  You have been Proven wrong admit it  Be a man for once instead of hiding behind your bottle ,F50
Its a good feeling giving something back  i got to give a lift to a friend on xmas day as his dad fell seriously ill  I supported him in his time of need and i wouldnt have been able to if I hadn't stopped   ,F50
No rls or insomnia   Wow you might be the first  Rls seems to be the notorious hallmark of kratom withdrawal  Either way  most of us can agree that it sucks in some form or another haha,F50
Yes it is stressful  like different parts of the brain are fighting  I keep reminding the impulsive part of my brain of the emptiness in porn  that its an empty promise ,F50
Sugar and heroin are two different substances  They have different structures and thus dissolve differently  I made a thread for you  You are wrong  Unless every person on r o is also wrong and we're not    We are done here ,F50
Thank you for this  the symbolism here is powerful  Statements like these are a great reminder that I'm supposed to feel the things I've been experiencing   Today and the last couple of days have been pretty tough  but I'm pulling through ,F50
Haha  Happy New Year to you too    ,F50
Proven wrong    You must be high    Anyone can verify what I'm saying ,F50
"Thank you for posting this  I'm around your age and I was just thinking that ""am I too young "" a few minutes ago  Reading your thoughts is helpful thank you  ",F50
You can totally do this  We all can  You inspired me to make a post about this very thing lol    Best of luck  ,F50
Why are you here ,F50
Happy New Year  Uncle S  ,F50
I can't have alcohol in the house  I'm too impulsive  Kudos to you ,F50
I really do try to be polite  but when it comes down to it do not cross me  ,F50
Very cool  congrats  ,F50
Awww   Love this PG  How appropriate     ,F50
I agree with the previous responses  You may need a detox  Sounds serious to me  You can stop ,F50
Sober in Saint Paul here  I've found the zen meetings to be really helpful  and with almost no mention of AA literature and religion  usually   Common Ground Meditation Center  The Zen Center  and Clouds and Water all have meetings    ,F50
My Groundhog wishes you and your Mom  Happy Sober New Year ,F50
Sign me up  lets do this ,F50
Are you me      Thanks for the reply ,F50
Thank you so much ,F50
I'll be here   Thanks so much  the encouragement means a lot     ,F50
Looking forward to that moment myself  Well done ,F50
I agree with the other posts  It might be a good idea to see a Dr or go to the ER,F50
Right   It's going to be a sweet space  I'm super excited  ,F50
Its late in the uk so not drinking with you tonight and I will spot you for tomorrow  ,F50
I remember that you started with Kratom and Wellbutrin almost at the same time   It takes some weeks for Wellbutrin to work properly  and that could maybe the case now   ,F50
I'll not drink today ,F50
Stay strong   I'm on day 1 too  I was very close to smoking a bowl but I reminded myself why I am doing this  I also just keep telling myself just get through today    we can worry about tomorrow tomorrow  ,F50
Great  I hope your liver has reacted well ,F50
Great job on one year   ,F50
Those things taste like cough syrup but you cant beat the  14 abv ,F50
You got to party and you feel good the next day  great stuff ,F50
These all sound like good reasons not to drink  thanks for sharing  I'll not drink with you today ,F50
Checking in  Good look to everyone and happy new year ,F50

https   www reddit com r opiates comments 5lhchd heroin argument please settle this for me ,F50
No gaming on my phone  I don't own a console or PC  I'm committing to a 90 day detox    I'm doing this because videogames take up far too much time and they're bad for me mentally and physically ,F50
That would definitely help me to have a SO that did not drink   My husband is looking forward to having drinks   I am feeling strong though   I think having a plan is the key   We CAN do this  ,F50
My self identified worst quality is the tendency to overreact  so I was especially proud of myself when I didn't go off the deep end  Sobriety has forced me to get it in check and it's definitely been useful when put in situations like the one today,F50
The first weeks were really tough for me  things did get better  Great job on another day ,F50
Thank you    So nice to hear a success story for this scenario   I CAN do it       ,F50
Planned it perfectly and got my last dip last night before bed   ,F50
Hahaha happy new year  ,F50
Yup    I will still be active in the community and will beat this wretched addiction  so it's okay  Good luck to you all ,F50
For once on New Years I didn't feel like throwing up during breakfast  ,F50
Cheers to not drinking together today  Congratulations on making it so far  ,F50
I am going through a difficult time emotionally  but when I drink I get even more sad  depressed and emotional  Good luck in your recovery ,F50
Instagram is the  1 trigger for me too ,F50
Me too  Snowshoeing in the mountains  Everyone on the path was cheery and it was the place to be  Starting the new year out right ,F50
cant be much worse then the last one  fuck i jinxed it ,F50
You also just said you dont want to ever die  so why dont you try picking one  perhaps the better option  ,F50
I remember feeling like I had this new super power early in sobriety  No matter what time of day or night it was  I could operate a car safely ,F50
Almost done with the first day hahaha I'm in on this ,F50
Luck is great  and I believe in both of you  I believe you have it in you to overcome your battles and be the 2017 champions ,F50
I appreciate women's AA meetings  I also attend agnostic meetings  Good luck ,F50
We banned you from modmail  not from the sub  Try to comment on the sub  If you cant i will unmute you  But the thread was up for at least 45 minutes after i sent you the link and before i muted you ,F50
I hope you are able to quit  the feeling of not knowing what happened the night before is the worst thing about drinking for me  it seems like it is always something terrible ,F50
I will not drink with you today  Glad you are here    ,F50
Thank you this does help  ,F50
Thanks u guys  I really love recovery and all the people in it  Made first meeting tonight and I really really feel great  Thanks God I got out of the house  Thanks again and Happy New Year  ,F50
I will not drink or smoke today  Keeping my short streak live  Done with that stuff  I had a great sober time in 2016  Moving forward in 2017 ,F50
good luck to PSU   know a lot of alums from there   great to see y'all relevant again    hopefully  the worst of it behind you   ,F50
Well said   Thanks  ,F50
YVW     You're nearly 2 weeks in   One year from now that will mean your badge is nearly 400   Stick with this   you can do it   ,F50
Good luck man  I'm 63 days without PMO and found that easier to kick than my cigarette habit ,F50
You can totally do this ,F50
"""You deserve all of the wonderful things that sobriety offers  ""  Amazingly put  Thank you for your thoughts    OP  you're never too far gone  We're all here with you  and we won't drink with you today  ",F50
Double amen to that P G ,F50
Thank you     I definitely identified with your post  Glad you're here  and I will not drink with you today ,F50
You're pretty wise  PG  ,F50
I can't tell you how many times I slipped up on Day 4  What is that about  Congrats and keep it up  I won't drink with you today ,F50
I CAN'T COMMENT ON YOUR SUB  FUCKING HALF WIT ,F50
I CAN'T COMMENT ON YOUR SUB  FUCKING HALF WIT ,F50
I hope you go  relax  and enjoy the coffee and the comfort of being around like minded people     ,F50
That's awesome   I find that when I get to help someone else out  I get just as much out of it as they do ,F50
Wait      You play billiards  Like the classic version  I thought I was the last one ,F50
Hah    ew    I'm as unfeminist as they come but fuck off with that bullshit ,F50
Maybe you need to figure out why you're angry ,F50
You can totally do it man    Don't waste any more of your time on a shit game  ,F50
Be careful with the demon that is suboxone,F50
Try to find s nee hobby  Also just streaming anything or video games that you can crawl through help a ton for the first few months ,F50
I'll unmute you but if you continue with the insults there I'm just going to do it again  You'll notice i have been polite here  ,F50
No more solo playing or watching of any sort or form    ,F50
You don't even know how to run the sub  you're wrong about basic information    It's a goddamned embarrassment you and fucktard are a mod of  r opiates        Embarrassment  ,F50
Congratulations  may this year be filled with joy ,F50
Have I gone blind ,F50
2016 was a year of almost pure crap for me too   But one good thing did come out of it   our dedication to sobriety   Not drinking right alongside you today ,F50
I play billiards  I like to play chess as well  but I suck at it  It's fun  though ,F50
Dry people  dry places resonated a lot with me  Maybe I'll try again tomorrow ,F50
It all starts with not drinking the first drink    I won't drink with you today  ,F50
My dad hasn't   He has alienated his entire family     I  however  am a mom and am working really hard to recover    One day at a time   ,F50
I missed the boat with Instagram  Besides relapse fodder  and a billion bucks  is it artistically worth anything ,F50
You are showing great restraint  Very impressive ,F50
Classic East European heritage  Where from   I'll take a guess at Poland  but edge my bets with Hungary ,F50
Same for me both counts  Started today  ,F50
I won't drink with you today ,F50
Heh   And people think we are the judgemental ones ,F50
My thoughts  is this is great   Congratulations  ,F50
Whoop whoop   Congrats ,F50
The number of times I fudged my numbers for doctors was epic   ,F50
Agreed  It's all relative to each individual  ,F50
Romania    Really close  I write and speak fluently  If I wasn't such a drunk I'd go back to translating ,F50
well  the good thing is that I'm starting a project bike with a friend  so I'll be just as broke but I won't be bored and I'll have a cook motorcycle by the end of it,F50
This   One day at a time ,F50
Some people are addicts  some not  If you are an addict  maybe it's easier to give it up completely and live your life rather than fantasizing and anticipating your next scheduled high  which probably is not nearly as good as in your imagination ,F50
Bike riding   physical exercise in general is not a bad way to go  ,F50
I feel you man ,F50
Mm I understand the thought process and what you are trying to say  however  this post seems like it will be more harmful then helpful on this sub    To each their own though   congrats on your 11 days  ,F50
I've starting seeing this girl who hates cocaine and doesn't know I use it and I really like her so I'm going to try and fill up my freetime by being with her,F50
Acknowledging the issues is the first step into cold water  Unfortunately it is the easiest step  but at least you've put yourself out there and begun   If you don't mind me asking  long have you been clean ,F50
You can do this  You can ,F50
In my case it's mostly irritability  awful night sweats and vivid dreams ,F50
Me  I went to a hot yoga class with blacklights and a DJ instead and it was great   Happy New Years everyone  ,F50
Dammit  Romania is a gorgeous country  hopefully get a chance to go there again one day ,F50
We can do it ,F50
Are you fucking kidding me    You and your bud have made yourselves into a goddamned joke     Go fuck yourself and your made up bullshit ,F50
I JUST DID THIS TOO  Hahaha  great day for a walk  it seems  Congrats  OP  I'm glad you enjoyed  ,F50
Oh the cunts who pre banned me are the adults    Go fuck yourself you goddamned posuer ,F50
You were proven wrong time and again  Holy Fuck you can read  ,F50
Concur  chess is amazing but fret not  I suck at it too  We should start a CAshittychessclub   or not ,F50
Great post Victoria  Happy New Year ,F50
Romania is beautiful  but the people are so corrupt  I haven't been back since I moved here at 11  I hope to visit soon  but family wise there's not much left there for me ,F50
hey everybody  i'm new   been in horrible CT w d's for a week now   so far  absolutely no relief   hopefully i can continue checking in on these threads   ,F50
Good luck every one ,F50
I'll checkin   I was scared to death on day 2   What do you mean I can never drink again   I've been doing it for 10 months one day at a time   It does get easier ,F50
I MUTED you for 72 hours because you were combative  I did not ban you  And you are now unmuted  ,F50
I'm totally up for that  I would like to play chess with drunk  shitty players as myself ,F50
Thank you  I dread to think how the situation would go down if I was drinking  ,F50
You don't know the kind of girl I'm talking about ,F50
Agree with r somuchtolearn    A week in and I was still a bit of a mess    Glad you're seeing a Dr  ,F50
I was a binge drinker from my very first drink  Today I have multiple years of sobriety and a completely different  better life  It can be done  ,F50
If it weren't rather late  where knifey is  I'd propose an online game  Maybe tomorrow   ,F50
Kick ass  Brother  So glad to hear that you had a good day  Keep passing it forward  Your story can help others  ,F50
I found it had to be my decision to stop  just be absolutely done  I Anthony Bordaine this shit now and every day  week  month is a gift I give to myself  ,F50
Don't matter    no wonder she don't want you ,F50
She's all over me  dude ,F50
And everyone else  ,F50
Good point    I think a lot of people that smoke are depressed  Quitting will only make the depression shine strong  It requires a whole life change to get better  not just putting down the buds ,F50
How cool that you got ahead of this thing so young   It took me  ahem  a bit longer to come to my so called senses   Not drinking today ,F50
I would love that  But please  don't judge me ,F50
You can do it  I believe in you  I won't drink with you today ,F50
Day 18  No motivation   ,F50
You're absolutely right  Thank you ,F50
Glad you posted this   Seems the video is posted and removed constantly    Two years ago I read Carr's book and quit  No even one puff  I also watched this video  frequented this sub  and explored Joel's library at why quit ,F50
"If you care stop treating her like some "" sloot "" and lock that shit down    Or expect her to fuck around as ANY single person would not just a CA female  ",F50
It's definitely more beneficial  Just try your hardest to stay away before it becomes an out of control addiction  Please take my word for it ,F50
Checking in late but I will not drink today ,F50
Huzzah   Happy new year indeed  ,F50
Excercise  its gives you a goal to work towards  helps you eat healthy  and makes falling asleep so much easier when you finish a long workout  Go to r fitness if you want some more advice,F50
Congrats  1501 DAYS is completely inspiring  Hope to be there in the future  Right now  I'm at two years and one day  without even one puff  All props go to Carr's book       ,F50
"I like that    ""It's catching ""  That is a great response ",F50
Wow you are an inspiration ,F50
I won't drink with you today   Got a plan ,F50
Seriously I'm awful  Shall PM tomorrow night ,F50
I'm sure right now it seems insurmountable  but trust us there is light at the end of the tunnel  We support you  because we know first hand the despair you are feeling right now  ,F50
Clear mucus is probably a good sign  I noticed I was coughing it up before I quit smoking and within a month or so of quitting it stopped  I think it's a natural reaction to the irritation of smoking but it will probably go away soon ,F50
Then drop her        I fail to see the issue ,F50
"Oh god  the lies make me crazy  I sometimes wonder if it would be easier dealing with them if they were like ""yeah I'm not really at the gym I'm actually at the bar next door instead """,F50
Wonderful   Thank you for sharing ,F50

Issue is I would like to have her  I think she would like me too  we're very similar ,F50
Then lock it down    or let her fuck  ,F50
Fellow Scot here  Well done on handling that situation so well  Weird situation indeed  Yeah it sure is a weird concept  This is my second new year in a row that I entered sober  Great way to start the year  ,F50
I relapsed  Very disappointed in myself  ,F50
Oh lord  I was sweating bullets going to my first meeting   It's a big step   Congratulations   ,F50
wow you handled that a lot better than i would have  i probably would have disowned a sibling for that  ,F50
I relapsed  Very disappointed in myself  ,F50
Night is young War    She already went to bed    CRY HAVOK   ,F50
I don't like her fucking around  She had some bad consequences before   Anyway  she's the definition of a slut  If you google it  you'll find the picture of her ,F50
"""and they've ONLY known me in sobriety ""  You make a point of wanting to emphasize something here   What do you mean exactly by this emphasis if I may ask ",F50
I will do my best to phase it out of my life  thanks for the advise,F50
Slut slut slut slut   1  1   ,F50
Speaking from my own experience  your last sentence is probably the most helpful thing to internalize when you stop smoking  Also  it gets better even if it doesn't feel like it  Not drinking helps a lot too    Edit  Spelling  ,F50
Sign me up please  I doubt I'll make it one year  but let's see ,F50
Yeah no wonder she fucks dudes other than you     I'd be fishing too ,F50
Maybe a couple of those Sober 30 days  or 30 day sober challenge would be helpful  ,F50
Getting advise like this will really help me to quit  thank you ,F50
I  too  have lost 10 years of my life to alcohol   We can do this   I will not drink with you today ,F50
Thanks for the good luck  I will do my best to stop it before it becomes a large issue,F50
Wow   I hope everything works out for you ,F50
Thank You  I made my first one  ,F50
Sending Kind Words your way ,F50
You're not paying attention  I have sex with her  no problem  She has sex with god and the world  after I'm done  I can't see how you view this as NORMAL  cause it's not  Guy or gal,F50
I'm so sorry   I really hope you find a way to stop doing this to yourself  and find a good place with you and with food   I'm no expert ,F50
Then tell her YOU want a relationship    Man up ,F50
Where was the ramen  ,F50
I'm trying to quit drinking coffee too  So watching almost everyone in the room sip on their coffee bummed me out  But the people were terrific ,F50
Thanks guys  I actually feel better already   This support is amazing ,F50
Thanks man  Feel free to PM me as well if you ever need to talk  ,F50
you can still jerk it if you'd like    Just not to porn    It will do wonders for your psyche and imagination  Masturbation is healthy and natural  porn is not  ,F50
Thank you so much for saying this    day 17 seems so far away  Congratulations  I am so happy I found this sub ,F50

Great tip on the app  We got this  ,F50
Well done   You are exactly right ,F50
u often dont get REM sleep when your high ,F50
When I felt like you do now  I went to an AA meeting and spilled my guts  I was so completely desperate that I actually got a sponsor and did all 12 steps  It has worked well so far ,F50
COMBATiVE    ARE YOU  COMPLETELY TWISTED ON DRUGS     You  wanted to talk to  me  there     But you banned me so that couldn't happen    What part of this do you not understand ,F50
I wouldn't put up with it personally but I guess it depends on how serious the relationship was feelings towards the ex  At least she knows you're not cool with all the shenanigans going on ,F50
Lol  to last sentence  ,F50
sign me up please ,F50
I never thought of doing it that way  I will give it a try,F50
Then it's not a CA issue    move on or dont,F50
I spoke to a counselor   She recommended meetings   I went and found support  tools  resources and fellowship   I've not looked back ,F50
ARE YOU NUTS    You and your buddy can't even make it so we can talk on your subreddit    You guys are like an unfunny bad news bears ,F50

My Sweet Prince   Placebo makes me cry almost every time ,F50
Yes  It was the pidgeonholing that put me off  I'm more things than an alcoholic  But that is my label  my introduction  in that moment that I had to  and have to  accept ,F50
Be careful with the party especially within the initial 90 days  Take initiative to organize activities with your friends outside of the house as much as you can    ,F50

Don't care   no reason for it    I'm not hate'in on all these CA men living in their mama's basements trying to holla    Free love ,F50
In talking about here at CA genius   And swearing and threats  Damn so sad ,F50
You're a joke    Fuck off   ,F50
Start with today  Go to a meeting  probably tomorrow at this time   It all starts with the desire to stop  You've already got that part ,F50
This was something that took me a LONG time to realize  Way too long ,F50
You didn't know wnat you were doing then  chief  you banned me from posting on your entire shitty site    Moron ,F50
Awesome  thanks for the suggestions  I've heard good things about them before  ,F50
Over 12 years here    just stopped     it's going to suck    but it's for the better good right ,F50
Either way  it sounds painful      Reminds me of someone here using a toilet brush one time  I'm sure no one can guess who   ,F50
Hey baby  looks like someone wants to whine    Unfortunately  everyone with half a brain no longer takes you seriously     Go fuck yourself   ,F50

So what is your plan of action  ,F50
Ah  I see  I am pretty sure you live very close to me  ,F50

I love my AA meetings  I make it a point  as do others to welcome a newcomer  New people coming to meetings helps me  Please come in ,F50

Now You've got me paranoid   haha ,F50
It has worked well for me so far  SD has been a great place to be when the urges get strong ,F50
Well I'd want her to not be on any of it   all it does is spiral down in 99 9  of cases ,F50
Wow  That's crazy  but I'm glad you're ok  We've got your back ,F50

I will not drink with you tonight  Glad you're here ,F50
I'm really not in a position to say  I can tell you what happened for me     If you're worried call the doctors offuce and see if you need to bring your appointment forward  That's what I would do  ,F50
"I've been told I get ""surly"" when I drink ",F50
Great to hear  Well done  ,F50
I would look into getting a court ordered paternity test if you want to be involved  Text her about this issue that way you have evidence she thinks your the father ,F50
Fuck you  hate monger    You are an embarrassment and should not mod any subs    Go fuck yourself ,F50
I won't drink tonight with ya     ,F50
Down about 10lbs here so far   Hoping to lose about 30 more ,F50
Uhh ohhh  This post is going to cause drama  ,F50
I will  I appreciate the advice,F50
The subs have a long half life  You will feel worse soon  Take lots of showers and baths  ,F50
That's what I was told too  This was an ice breaker for me  I'm gonna try to go as many days as possible ,F50
Use water and exercise once the nicotine out of your system man   Limit your coffee as well   Get through each bad moment because it gets better   ,F50
When I felt the same as you describe  I timidly crawled into an AA meeting and came out with hope   I haven't needed a drink since  even when my Dad died suddenly in 2014 ,F50
I'm in  I will not drink with you tonight ,F50
Can you just talk to her and ask  Is this something you think she will be honest to you about  I understand your concern  I really do  Heroin is a SCARY thing  It terrifies me  ,F50
u are an ungreatfull bastard  so go buy some surstrming ,F50
Go watch these on Netflix if you haven't  Black Mirror  The OA Narcos   Amazon Prime has 1 month free trials and you can get Amazon Video with that which has all kinds of great stuff too   ,F50
Thank you for plugging that subreddit ,F50
I used Kratom to get off of heroin  It pulled me out  not the other way around  Just personal experience  ,F50
I personally think social media is cancer  ,F50
In the beginning  I think a lot of us take one hour at a time  Hang in there ,F50
Or saltlakrits    But that's delicious though   ,F50
Yeah  I was thinking a meeting every day or even every other day would be hard  so that's a happy compromise for me  Good luck    ,F50
We can do this ,F50
Thank you  Agreed  let's do this ,F50
Congrats on one year  Happy Re Birthday  ,F50
Do I leave a comment here to check in for January ,F50
If I didn't just want to get out with my liquor I'd say something     I'll take liquor and some judgemental shithead over no liquor and a judgemental shithead  Thankfully most clerks merely make the usual small talk and don't ask for ID ,F50
J'aime this curious mix of Levitra  hahaha fuck you auto correct   languages   Tack sa mycket jajaja,F50
That's great that he wants to quit and that you want to support him  This has to come from him  though  That's the beginning and the key to a person's sobriety  Good luck,F50
I'm in  it was okay when I was younger but  it's time to stop  ,F50
Welcome  From what I've read  you might want to also check out  r AlAnon  Al Anon is a long standing support organization for families and friends of alcoholics  ,F50

Forever grateful of this subreddit  18 days clean today  ,F50
Good luck friend  I'm the same boat ,F50
I read somewhere that the liver can heal fast but once it's really fucked up  there's nothing left to do  I may be wrong though  Alcohol can fuck up a liver really bad ,F50
Feeling like a normal person that doesn't feel ashamed of himself ,F50
Happy new year  See you all on Stay Clean January ,F50
We're here  I promise ,F50
Now is the time  ,F50
Get it straight you are so Fucked up that you do not remember i came to back up what she said    Haha whos the dumbass now   ,F50
Most of those people would complain from coffee WD  If you've ever had to deal with opiate WD you most likely won't have an issue  Almost all of these people have never had to go through opiate WD or any from a hard drug ,F50
We are right there with you  one day at a time   Also  if you feel an urge  craving or just mental distraction  try to remember that this mental condition is temporary and that you are able to wait for it to pass ,F50
I find your post so motivational  It's post like this that keep me going  Thank you  Love that quote  Taking it for my tool box  I won't drink with you today  ,F50
Lope didn't help me but kratom did  Everyone is different ,F50
So real  Just remember that you don't have to dwell on a mistake just because you spent a lot of time making it  Upward and Onward  ,F50
Checking in  Here's to another good month of sobriety ,F50
It's true for many ,F50
Know what's weird  You didn't drink and you're happily posting today  if you drank you would be posting w guilt and shame  I dunno why we drink we always regret it  it's illogical but really hard  Glad you didn't drink d00d,F50
This was beautiful to read  thank you ,F50
Huh  I'm pretty sure somewhere a child is going hungry tonight  Two things I never waste  Booze and food  I've seen dirt poor  And I'm not OK with being an entitled ass because of that ,F50
I get dick pics on the daily      Attractive schlong ,F50

Exactly how I'm feeling  it's like I'll be high but still have this feeling there  Then I'm just high and feeling like I need more and more and more to feel ok  but it never comes  ,F50
Incredible work guys  what does year long victory taste like ,F50

Welcome back  I tested the waters after 10 months off and regret it  But I take what I learned to make a stronger run at never drinking again  I will not Drink with you  ,F50
Appreciate the response  it's like it's too hard to even write down that I will because if I fail I have physical proof  ,F50
I will not drink with you tonight  ,F50
"I like that line   ""   missing out on the ""fun"" of drinking  I skipped drinking so I wouldn't miss out on the fun today ""  ",F50
If you're not making over  10K per year gaming  just don't come back to it    unless it's co op on a simple  silly game with your nephew on the Playstation in the living room  ,F50
I'm so proud of you for going  It was scary and overwhelming for me at first too    Ultimately sticking with AA was the single best decision of my life  ,F50
Checking in  One step at a time,F50
No matter what I say you're going to try and come up with some rebuttal and wave your dick around ,F50
Agreed  I fucking hate what social media has become ,F50
"No one is ""waving their dick around"" except you   You have been attacking anyone that replies to you that doesn't agree and or has an alternative experience to the one you have claimed to have ",F50
Exactly   I did whatever it took to stay calm that first day   ate whatever I felt like  took 3 showers  played video games  whatever   You've got this ,F50
Joining the day 1 January 1 crowd today  Last night I discovered at 47 peer pressure still works  With friends  safe place  but I was not supposed to drink and I did  Today I was sober though    ,F50
Hope you're doing better  Take care of yourself  ,F50
Come find us in the chat  There are usually people around to hang with  There is a link on the sidebar   Welcome ,F50
I can totally relate to your post   It is so NOT worth it  anxiety and feelings of hopelessness    Cheers to us refusing to give up ,F50
    Yay        ,F50
Wouldn't it be better to get real girls and have real sex  I will be finishing one year without fapping tomorrow and it's awesome  What I am now working on is quitting porn ,F50
On the same timeline brother,F50
Welcome ThreeFistsCompromise   I'm not drinking with you tonight   ,F50
Awesome  Great work ,F50
Got offered edibles from my old hook up  Easily turned them down  He congratulated me on being clean for a year ,F50
Give the account to me    s    Though seriously  good luck man ,F50
As a camp counselor when I was about 15  a kid told me she wanted to have spots on her face just like me when she grew up  Don't read too much into it  ,F50
This is wonderful advice  I'll just add that sometimes even a day is a bit much to chew  Sometimes it's just an hour or two that I need to focus on  ,F50
That's so awesome  Happy new year    ,F50
It's like a demon  But thankfully it gets conquered everyday by people with will power and patience  ,F50
Congrats on your First Week   The first few are really tough but I know you're tougher   Keep fighting the good fight and Happy New Year ,F50
He says if I leave him that I'm giving up on us ,F50
Aw  mommy didn't bring you the right sammich  How about get off your ass and make her one ,F50
   I especially enjoy the added energy and general sense of peacefulness that sobriety is graciously giving to me   Oh man  that sounds amazing    yes  please  I am looking forward to that  ,F50
I can be a grade A shit talker  but never violent  except occasionally to doors ,F50
I'm happy for you and your great day as well     ,F50
I did ok today  I ran my fingers along the healing skin toward the evening which I could have limited had I reapplied lotion  I didn't worsen it  though  No new damage but it could have happened    I was just fortunate ,F50
Stay strong  First 3 days are the worst   We got this ,F50
Nice  Keep it up  One day at a time ,F50
Are you checking out local AA meetings ,F50
How old are you  And why did you post this here  And maybe a homeless person would have eaten that instead of you throwing it away  ,F50
If your an alcoholic you have three ends if you keep drinking  Wet brain  dead  prison mental institution  To drink is to die brother,F50
Being optimistic is really a double edged sword    It does show incredible strength on your part that you are willing to be helpful while still distancing yourself  That is a very healthy outlook on the situation and I applaud you for it  ,F50
What the fuck are you talking about,F50
I read 3oz Maple Syrup    now I can't stop throwing up everywhere  Thanks op,F50
I will not drink with any of you tonight  Happy New Year  ,F50
It's definitely not a panacea for addiction  ,F50
You had me there  Congratulations and happy new years  ,F50
NICE  Only 332 more days for mine     ,F50
Let me guess    It was a shitty car to begin with and you have no insurance   Who cares you would have lost that job anyway   You would have found a reason to     Now drink   Bye fam ,F50
 I'm a Leo      Astrology isn't real  ,F50
I was ok when it was just a Friday  or Saturday drinking    Some are saying that it's ok to drink once in a while now  But I was so much better when I didn't drink at all  ,F50
That's what's up man  I think we can both do it,F50
I completely agree  I live in SE WI and have family in the central part of the state  Even though the drinking cultures are different  the common denominator in most activities is alcohol ,F50
How did you stop drinking ,F50
Oh sorry next time we will provide caviar and lobster    Get out of here you prick ,F50
I know what you mean  every so often my brain is racing with thoughts of how to get some  how I could hide it etc  it helps to know someone else is going through this too  ,F50
Even if it's internet comrades  it's nice to know others exist    ,F50
"I was doing pretty good recently and had a relapse  There's always the ""I was better off before that PMO"" feeling  ",F50
Good for you  fam  Have a good day tomorrow  You deserve it ,F50
When we was young we would get that canned ham mixed with potatoes   you know what we were grateful at least there was something on the plate,F50
Not sure why I needed to remind myself why I stopped in the first place but here I am anyway  Could have been a lot worse as things go  ,F50
Thank you  Two years of pretty consistent scrutiny for being a vegetarian has prepared me for this ,F50
Since you mention English  Oversee means to watch supervise  like a boss oversees their employees  The word you're looking for is overlook ,F50
This makes me really happy  Sending warm  sober 2017 wishes your way ,F50
Good luck  You moved to a place that when I visited it briefly  I was shocked at the overwhelming presence of cigarettes and wine as the national raison d'tre ,F50
You're on for 92 days according to the flair  you're doing great   ,F50
Listen to me you need to get married to this broad  Who cares if she's a sloot that's hot  She's been around   so what    tell her to take a shower and you're good to go ,F50
Day one for me as well  Congrats on the first 8 hours  Wishing you luck on the rest of day 1 and on your day two  You've got this ,F50
So do I have a problem  I drink when because at the time I tell myself it's ok  but then regret it after  ,F50
That is quite a lot    It's great you noticed it as a problem and are doing something to combat it     I wish you the best for this new year,F50
sign me up starting over ,F50
You're on 1 day  you can totally do this  I believe in you ,F50
Woah   this Wellness plan worksheet is perfect for a self improvement nerd like me  Thanks VE ,F50
Congratulations  Great post  thank you ,F50
Thanks  I think I have all the proof I need at this point and know that I am better off when not drinking ,F50
Wow  this is powerful  I'm so glad you made it through that  Happy 2017 ,F50
Admitting you have a problem is just about the hardest part  The next hardest is taking the first step to fixing the problem  Hope to see you stick around  we are all in this fight together  ,F50
Thanks to this group  It gives me an anchor when om lost ,F50
Thank you for this post  ,F50
Yeah i know it scares me too  Dont know when the stroke would have happened  I don't remember anything happening  Why would it fluctuate so much too  Like mornings it feels better than afternoons  Nights feel better too after work ,F50
Congratulations on triple digits and happy new year to you  too ,F50
Awesome man  glad you're ok now ,F50
 I played it off as a joke  That's how I usually defuse things like that  Great job ,F50
Love it  We went to a friend's house for the Packer game tonight and were there for a nightmarish 30 minutes before leaving   they had all been drinking for 48 hours and I'm pretty sure there was a girl eating pizza in her sleep,F50
Wow  I could have written this  ,F50
Thank you   ,F50
When I said that I mena headshop extracts that are sold for people who are trying to get high  The ones that may or may not have some crazy shit in them ,F50
Welcome  I will not drink with you today ,F50
Keep your head up  Loosing people sucks ass  one of the many reasons I continue to push on today instead of being a victim of my own mind  ,F50
Oh yeah  and no more drinking as soon as the benzo is started,F50
This is irrelevant  but a long time ago I ordered a cheeseburger from McDonald's and they forgot the patty  I ate that shit anyway  It wasn't bad  I kind of miss those shitty McDoubles  Sigh   ,F50
Yeah  headshop extracts suck  I bet a decent amount of them are spiked with Chinese opioids fucking losers,F50
On the other hand  what part of life does alcohol fulfill for you ,F50
I'm sober right along with you ,F50
If you're seizing  you can very easily and painfully die  You're going to die ,F50
Thank you so much ,F50
What a wonderful NDV    Good job    ,F50
Good luck all  remember to check in here often  there is no way I would be at 4 months smoke free without this sub  ,F50
No alcohol for me for the next 24 hours  Yucky much  2017 here I come  ,F50
No alcohol for me for the next 24 hours  Yucky much  2017 here I come  ,F50
I learned to have patience with the ebbing and flowing of my commitment to sobriety  As long as I was taking the appropriate steps and using my tools  it was okay to have doubts  Vigilance and self reflection have been key  ,F50
This is so random but I screen shotted this earlier    I was emailing someone my newemail address and this prompt came up    To clarify I've never text you or text about you    https   imgur com 8IutADd  How weird,F50
 And then it hit me  This is dumb   I had that same ah ha moment when I was trying to make up all these rules to rein in my drinking ,F50
I sure don't  As someone who has a history of hangovers that I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy  waking up without is one of my favorite things about being sober ,F50
It entertains  makes me feel good  passes time  makes dumb things interesting  makes conversations with strangers easier  What doesn't it do ,F50
Awesome  just awesome    well done x,F50
That always gets me   no one HAS to drink on New Year's  or literally any other day  Happy new year ,F50
Circle of Death and videogames are definitely my favorite drinking games  I like shooting dice and betting drinks along with change too ,F50
Also I want to thank everyone for reading and responding  ,F50
My wife is the most amazing person in my life  Words can't express the wonders she has done for me ,F50
Which it will still be a worry  but what can you do ,F50
Havent been drunk yet so pretty good  You  Had a few beers but eating bulk so too full to drink much,F50
Please speak from the I and do not challenge people  It's not supportive or encouraging  ,F50
I got a DUI two weeks after I was hospitalized for alcohol poisoning    I didn't have an option to get sober    Believe me  I'd have rather gotten sober without having a record  ,F50
I believe I did speak from the I  That was apparent in my second paragraph   And I removed the challenge  Sorry about that   ,F50
You have your opinion     Which is just that     An opinion  Do not bash others choices for recovery  It is a rule here  ,F50
Find someone who has a recovery program you want and ask them to sponsor you   To what lengths are you willing to go to   I did and it worked out well ,F50
I think most people will swing between extremes a lot of times before reaching moderation ,F50
You are so darling  and your face looks fine  You got this  girl ,F50
You can do it  I'm in the same boat  I will not drink tonight with you ,F50
Drinking is a pretty sure fire way of making all of your problems worse  Including depression  Get to an aa meeting  be honest with people and listen to those who have gone through it and come out glistening on the other side,F50
I luckily haven't had the displeasure of actually being denied the sale  Has that happened to you where they got judgemental and actually wouldn't sell to you over it ,F50
Thank you  I have diagnosed alcoholism  PTSD  depression    borderline personality disorder  At five months sober  sometimes I feel like I'm never going to be happy again with or without alcohol  Your story inspired me ,F50
My HP is a universal spirit my dead grandparents  I too cringe at the prayer chanting ,F50
like less jerking off ,F50
Congrats on your turnaround   I remember the helpless feeling    horrible place to be ,F50
If that's what it did for me  I'd have no worries ,F50
Kratom saved me  It allowed me access to choices again and the ability to rebuild my life  One year ago I was HOPELESS  I wish I had learned about it sooner but grateful it was not any later  ,F50
Right  I've also had friends tell me that I can't be pregnant at their weddings so that I'll be able to drink  I keep an arsenal of snarky replies just for these oddly specific conversations ,F50
Thank you so much  It seems surreal that I've made it to 100  Can't wait for 200 ,F50
No but I work in retail and I've seen it happen  Usual result is someone senior getting called over and asking you more politely to leave  If you refuse then security is called ,F50
Awesome  Happy New Year  ,F50
Enjoyed reading this  Thank you for sharing  Recovery really is an amazing thing  ,F50
Misery loves company unfortunately  ,F50
I fucked up  Threw out my ecig last night then this morning I cracked and bought a pack  Got two cigs in then threw out the pack and got my ecig out of the trash  Baby steps I guess ,F50
Two days in and still here ,F50
I did not drink with you last night  ,F50
Awesome to hear this  3 months  Way to go ,F50
That's a great way to look at it  Good on ya  ,F50
"Whoever created that blog still needs to ""launch"" it  according to WordPress ",F50
Just remember  while it's good to stay positive  relapsing every 11 days isn't the same as quitting  Your next step is to be offered a joint by your friend and not smoke it  ,F50
I understand that  I guess it's always just confused me that to her there's a way to rationalize everything  She's such a no nonsense  practical person otherwise  I guess I'm just venting  No matter what consequences come from something it never seems to matter ,F50
Great work earning that chip  I'm going to my first meeting tomorrow  any advice you'd be willing to share ,F50
I will not drink today   In fact  I don't even have any desire to   Too much other stuff going on ,F50
One year   High five,F50
Checking in  I have had some urges so far but not given in  I think posting will help me ,F50
You can still sign up January  I signed up for both  Let's do it ,F50
Came across this sub by chance  I generally lurk  had no idea this was hear  Things could be better for me  but I wish you all strong luck this year  You guys seem great  ,F50
Still am homeless and hanging on white knuckled  ,F50
Good job  We're all proud of you ,F50
I will not drink with you  either   Raising my water glass to you  though   My best advice is to plan out each day with activities and strategies so you don't unwittingly fall back into old habits ,F50
Sponsor not counselor   No training or approval needed to become a sponsor   Don't judge AA by single member   There is no real membership in that you don't apply and get accepted  you just show up  There are service boards ,F50
Then maybe you might have to increase water intake  Or do you think it's a hormonal imbalance ,F50
I'm only a couple days in  hang in there we are gunna do this  That's 8 hours you have back  it's yours  not alcohols  Don't give alcohol any more time ,F50
I mean  it just reads like an advertisement that serves as anything other than to benefit anyone but the salesman  Doctors and AA were the only ways I managed through immediate and post acute withdrawals ,F50
You've done good progress  You're moving from games full time to games   Youtube   Then you can go Youtube full time  then move to another hobby   Our addictions just move around  from games to youtube  then reddit or facebook  ,F50
Nah  it's not anything like that  but thanks  I know what you mean ,F50
I'm guessing that's for if someone is sloppy drunk slurring falling over ,F50
Only if you give me a blue phat  Haha thanks man  D,F50
maybe she is just awkward and didn't mean anything hurtful by it  I do stuff like that on accident once in a while  ,F50
This describes my issues when I was drinking    Don't smoke any more    When I stopped I craved sugar candy for a few weeks   Things starting to normalize now ,F50
"Wish I knew how to edit  I should have said "" make amends except when to do so would harm them OR OTHERS""",F50
Yes  I will wake up multiple times during the night when I've been drinking  and I usually wake up super early and can't go back to sleep  Last night  I slept ten uninterrupted hours    ,F50
I don't like pancakes  but then I can say beef with butter  D,F50
 D me neither  High five  ,F50
Thank you  I'm creating so many opportunities for growth as I continue forward  Congratulations on 274 days ,F50
And thanks for taking the time to read and comment  It means a lot ,F50
It truly is  Congratulations on one year ,F50
Same  Such an odd feeling  I'm glad I'm not the only one  ,F50

Honestly  once you quit smoking you may find that the depression and anxiety go away   ,F50
"I like to search ""moderation"" in the SD search bar and read all the posts and comments  including mine  about moderation fails  It always gets my attention  ",F50
I'm not necessarily sure I'm done forever   But I knew I made the right choice to take a long break when I had next to zero cravings to smoke once I stopped ,F50
Good job taking this step  We've got your back ,F50
Get the book off the side bar  If you can't sleep listen to the 'alcohol mastery'  podcast  Take action  Get on it ,F50
This is what I tell myself too  Makes a huge difference when you remind yourself that this is a choice that you have agency over  We don't drink because we choose not to  not because we can't ,F50
I am with you  Here we go  I will not drink with you today ,F50
I have gotten the book and just about to get started with it ,F50
What a beautiful show of support  ,F50
The only way to get back on track is to get back on track  For me  writing down how cruddy I felt being hungover and the like was really helpful to me the next time I felt like having a drink  ,F50
"I'm only 22  heavy daily smoking for the last 4 years  and I'm getting this feeling too a week in  It's pretty awesome  At what point did you get the ""extreme clear headedness"" everyone talks about ",F50

Woah  That's really cool  Congratulations      ,F50
 good for you it's the small victories like that that add up to success,F50
I think you already know what you need to do ,F50
totally unrelated but your screen name is hilarious    ,F50
Definitely  It will help you develop good habits and not waste precious years as a teen    Source  in 21  14 18 were wasted on things like porn  ,F50
I'm confused  What does from the I mean  And what's the thing with challenging people ,F50
Thank you for your words of encouragement  I feel like this time will be the one where I quit for good ,F50
Congratulations   Sounds like you've had a great year  I will NOT drink with you today   ,F50

It's already early evening here in Australia  and my usual time to have that first drink   I'm already not drinking with you tonight ,F50
We're not able to answer these specific medical questions  if you're worried you should speak with a doctor about the symptoms  The withdrawals are different for everyone  ,F50
Got very little sleep on second night  Made it through though ,F50
Love that song   Stop attacking X mas trees ,F50
Why is there so many excuses for drinking  How do you stop the excuse making ,F50
You know how many people are going hungry  Come on ffs dont waste food  What  kind of reaction did you want here ,F50
Done with hat gaming crap   Temptation is still hanging around  but it can kiss my ass   Signing in ,F50
Keep it up pal  Just hit 22 days here  Take it as slow as you need to  ,F50
Thanks man  I kinda feel they're mutually supportive now  the habits but also the quitting  We'll see  Good luck to you too ,F50
it's definitely your fault   you control yourself  not someone else   if she was drinking and pressuring you into it then it would be her that should smarten up,F50
Only one way to find out ,F50
My wife committed me after a wild binge  which included paranoia and me saying some suicidal stuff  I had a BAC over 2 5  I am now over 3 years sober  You can do it  Get the help you need ,F50
"With you on the nofap  Not so sure about the slogan lol  ""Less fiends in '17"" I guess has a ring to it  ",F50
Don't mean to scare you or anything  but whistle in your breath is an early symptom of COPD  All the more reason to continue with this quit and make it last   But do look into it for sure,F50
ARE YOU DETOXING   TRY HYDROCODONE   YOU'LL BE AMAZED HOW HYDROCODONE MAKES YOU FEEL BETTER DURING WITHDRAWALS   Why are we allowing this ,F50
In your position man  first day  should I quit porn  ,F50

  She was also the major cause why I became depressed and alcoholic in the past years  No she wasn't  ,F50
It saved me a while ago as well   It's a good place ,F50
  How do I tell her not to stress me because it makes me want to drink   You don't  ,F50
Removed   duplicate post,F50
You'll get there  For me I definitely knew when it was time  That's what I have been sharing with people  You'll know when enough is enough,F50
""" Only  16"" It's not a healthy habit  no matter your age  Quit while you're still young  it'll be easier to kick ",F50

Checking in  Happy New Years to everyone   May your Willpower be unwavering and prevalent in this rough journey ahead ,F50
 to have patience with the ebbing and flowing of my commitment to sobriety   I needed to hear this  Thanks   ,F50
It takes a week or two  but eventually you will sleep better because you don't have nicotine racing through your blood ,F50
Day 20   There with ya bro   Physically I'm good   Tired  sure  but really just waiting for the opportunity to get to be me again   The way I'm feeling  never again will I fuck with this plant ,F50

I was broke as fuck,F50
ITT  Every CA Mother loses ttheir shit ,F50

Really  I mean sometimes it's non stop  Just complaining and complaining  ,F50
Really similar situation for me  too  Free herb because of the lifestyle I was living   First time being sober for x mas in 8 years ,F50
Thanks   so true about the hangovers   it wouldn't be uncommon or me to have a 2 or 3 day hangover  ,F50
Thanks   the shame and half remembered incidents are hard to deal with   and when someone would tell me what I did I had no choice to believe them ,F50
"I get the meaning  but every time I see one of these posts I'm like  ""but I'm not drinking ""  I am not a clever man ",F50
Heya neighbor  Sober here in MN ,F50
No booze  only water tonight  and tomorrow too ,F50
Thanks for the great replies   much appreciated here  ,F50
Good call  I'll probably get my dates straightened out once I'm back in the office  1 more day for the observed NY day for me though ,F50
Hey  thanks for the hint  I'm so sorry  mistakes like these don't usually happen to me  I was just very drunk and barely able to communicate in my native language ,F50
Not even close to being the same      Try reading all the positive stories sometime then point me to the positive stories of shooting up dope  You are a fucking idiot ,F50
Yup I'm a sales man that doesn't do sales     ,F50
Yeah with that it's not a problem  I actually prefer I keep at it  I'm in pain 24 7 and it helps plus has other benefits and zero negative impact on my life only positive  What's the problem again ,F50
Yeah I'll try LOL   Are you a guilty pleasure type of drunk as well  I only ever listen to 80s stuff when trashed  I wasn't even alive  I was like minus ten for that decade ,F50
This is amazing  You should be so happy with yourself ,F50
I went to one AA meeting last week  and will be going again tomorrow   It was nerve wracking on the walk in but totally worth it ,F50
Watford are in trouble indeed  ,F50
What video games  ,F50
good work  I'm still trying to break the 2 month mark ,F50
I find that I get a headache around the 5 day mark  Could be withdrawal  or could be unrelated  Your body is under stress during the first leg of quitting  so it could be stress related as well ,F50
Usually just whatever I'm playing normally that has multiplayer and we make our own rules for it to be a drinking game  Mario Party and fighting games are also really good go to games ,F50
Best of luck  I will not drink with you tonight,F50
The trick is to get so drunk you don't give a fuck  Well  at least until the fear kicks in ,F50
That Sissoko reminds me of a frightened horse on a frozen lake   he's so ungainly  lol  Newcastle is certainly coming back up   you've got a team much better than a lot of Premier league teams this season      ,F50

You're a fucking saleman  I prefer idiots ,F50
Thank you so much  Will do  ,F50
Jan 8th is 9 years for me hopefully ,F50
Almost 3am  Im off work for anothr week or so  Been drinking etc all day night  You know  What your gonna be doing ,F50
It's spam  I reported it  I urged using doctors instead and he called me an idiot  He's not a fellow addict  just an asshole trying to make a buck and not being forthcoming about it  You should report it ,F50
And these people want  15 an hour   hahahahahahahaha,F50
Haha  Is this your subtle way of proposing or something ,F50
Im a former CA and I run Ultra Marathons now  Ill run my first 100 mile race in September  Being a CA mentally prepares you for pain pretty well ,F50
It's spam  He probably doesn't even use Kratom  That URL he provided is a sales site  Report it as spam  please ,F50
What a huge achievement  guys   Congratulations  you inspire all of us  ,F50
You've made several incorrect assumptions about my beliefs  That's OK  I don't mind  Just sayin'  ,F50
If you think you can safely go back you don't understand addiction   ,F50
If you really cared about people recovering  you wouldn't be such an asshole  Report this spammer  guys  This   sub is going to shit   subs' moderators are very concerned about sales and promotional posts like this ,F50
Maybe time to taper down ,F50
I'm right here with you friend  Going to do my best to stay sober 2017  Been sleeping absolutely terribly these past 2 nights  and thinking pretty much constantly about alcohol   We can do this ,F50
Yeah that's true  ,F50
 taper  lol what's that  I've tried the whole tapering deal before but just ended up slamming them beers,F50
The epitome for me is when I try to justify that the price of alcohol  as if it's a necessary expense  but cut back on other things like quality food ,F50
I can't leave my command at the moment  I am on restriction  Not even suppose to have access to the internet ,F50
Thank you so much for this  The idea of not having to be that person anymore really is amazing  I'm not quite up to being exhilarated yet   Your words really touched me and I am so grateful that we are not drinking today ,F50
Hey friend  hope you're doing well  Only a full day in myself  best of luck  We can do this  ,F50
Why did you decide enough is enough after so long ,F50
Well we are here on stopgaming not gaming in moderation ,F50
I'd go after Will Hughes    ,F50
Five months doesn't sound long  Yes it does  You're killing it  well done ,F50
Awww  you too Eligiac  do you know I had to google that word   it's lovely    Have a great day ,F50
Have a bit less alcohol every day to keep withdrawal down   slowly get out of it   Take a break for however long  before ya do it all over again ,F50
I was there  I thought Kratom was a miracle when I was  You'll hate it when you're back on the street again  trust me    which I'd bet my life on unless you give up opiates entirely  ,F50
Alcohol is probably the biggest hurdle when quit smoking  Good Job ,F50
I doubt anime is a great idea but beside that I completely agree ,F50
Yay  Isn't it wonderful that you don't have to worry about people noticing  and judging  your drinking  ,F50
Welcome Spiral   Stick with it  your future self will thank you for it ,F50

Congratulations on a year and Happy New Year too ,F50

Have you ever tried seeing a counselor or therapist ,F50
Congratulations  You are where I want to be in 364 days ,F50
Well done   I've experienced similar benefits to not drinking also  My income is up  weight is down and relationship better too   I raise my coffee to a further 12 months   one day at a time of course    ,F50
Mango    I've used mascara and lip gloss so I'm in no place to judge and also hopefully no one ever borrowed my makeup in high school  ,F50
Hughes could work in a sort of Pirlo esque quarterback midfield position  Benitez turned Xabi Alonso into this type of player at Liverpool   but I see your point    Hopefully you keep Ayoze Perez  he looks class  ,F50
Don't worry about other people   Save yourself  ,F50
Suppose it's good to see the CA tradition of wasting plant life is continuing into the new year ,F50
Thanks a lot for your advice ,F50
I will not drink with you tonight    ,F50

"Same here man  I followed about 1000  ""Instagram Models"" and scrolled endlessly through my feed and just be enslaved to their bodies  Good for you  Welcome to the club  ",F50

Thank you for the advice  ,F50
I am so determined to do this  ,F50
Yay  Thanks for sharing   ,F50
Back up after falling asleep early  I didn't drink with you last night  ,F50
It's to keep track of how many days I haven't smoked  If I start on odd days I lose track and I prefer not to ,F50
I'm doing na and looking into a relapse prevention group  I'm going as far as possible this time  I'll work as hard as I have to ,F50
Well done  I've enjoyed your posts over the months  and am glad as can be that you're Mr  Year now  Good on ya ,F50

Good job  I'm planning to quit in a couple of weeks  Meanwhile  I need to figure out if I need to keep alcohol on hold or figure out ways to manage not smoking while drinking ,F50
We are with you Anongrl9  Take care of yourself  seek help if you need it   I'm not drinking with you today   ,F50

Isn't that so weird          Nooo  gets down on one knee and opens a beautifully crafted wooden box of booze ,F50
I get that a lot actually  the Negasonic Teenage Warhead look   thanks ,F50
Yes indeed  it really is exhausting and alcohol is an asshole ,F50
"There are atheist agnostic freethinkers meetings  Do a search for ""waaft"" or ""aaagnostica ""   Founder Bill realized later in life that he'd overdone the religious language  and said so  The book  of course  was never changed to reflect that  ",F50
my doctor put me on lexapro  it was a night and day change  also if you have a constant anxiety try the phone app calm com  it's free and very effective,F50
I'd recommend not fucking with xanax man  Shit fries your brain ,F50
Nice  it's so easy to see the difference sometimes  You gotta tell me about the whiteboard though ,F50
Thanks  But if I may ask  what do you think is wrong with anime  He said in his post it was something he liked ,F50
I believe the link in the FAQ regarding non alcoholic beer is broken  It went to page not found on my Reddit mobile app ,F50
Hey Liverrot   this is the hardest part   and you're doing great   A minute at a time  whatever it takes  Please keep checking in  we're here for you  And I'll keep cheering you on     ,F50
Sorry  I must not have been clear   I do take pride in the days behind   But it is the day now and the days to come where we need to focus     Congrats on your 22 ,F50
Thought you may raise this  Undergarments  not trousers  If you don't it'll get chilly down there   Shouldn't you be asleep anyway  Must be what  4am where you are ,F50
Congrats  man  Great work ,F50
Awesome  was unsure if dog or woman before picture loaded  then  both ,F50
You brought tears to my eyes  A really inspiring read  Many best wishes to you on you ongoing recovery  Will gladly not drink with you ,F50
Nice work  was a little hesitant to ask for mine at a meeting but once I had that cheap little scrap of metal in my hand it did something for me ,F50
That sounds delightful   Question though   isn't pickled cabbage just sauerkraut ,F50
PM me with your city and I'll get you in contact with your local 24hr hotline for CA or NA,F50

My first 3 days were characterised by the constant feeling of missing having lost something   Don't lose hope  it gets easier  Use some willpower and prove it to yourself ,F50
The great thing is that you don't ever have to feel like this again  Happy new year ,F50
Ha interesting  Certainly could have used some better communication in my last relationship ,F50
I'm an atheist  What I get from AA is comfort from other people who understand my struggle  That's it ,F50
Haha  'Wow you look great '   'Not really  I just don't look like crap ' Nice work on keeping your streak going ,F50
Plastic wrap and a blow torch   Lol  love it  That's awesome   congrats on the success ,F50
Cacti  One of mine is 18 years old   fucking enormous now  Requires next to no care  and isn't easy to set alight  Perfect CA plant ,F50
You can do it ,F50
thanks  yeah i am actually feeling the sense of excitement peace that annie grace was talking about  i can see more firmly than ever how breaking my sobriety for the same old night out was a waste of time  ,F50
Sucks that you had to feel that  you never know when you will get tested  Hah I'm not religious at all but I can feel that vocabulary and mode of thought seeping in  Good stuff keeping on through the new year ,F50
What kind of business are you running ,F50

Congrats  Art is much better sober ,F50
Well they both sound delish   And yes I'm from Minnesota   Land of 10 000 lakes and completely populated by Germans  Scandinavians and Indians ,F50
and on your year too KP ,F50
Haha I love your name  I've been drinking it for years now  but I imagine I might start drinking even more of it now  ,F50
I'm sorry if you feel I was preaching  I really didn't mean to come across that way ,F50
Well the 12 steps were apparently inspired by Bill Wilson's Ouija board sessions with a dead 15th century monk so it's subjective whether they are the be all and end all of recovery principles ,F50
Try tapering with vodka   Always exciting and guaranteed to fail ,F50
Hi there  this is a good place to be for those who are dealing with recovery or addiction  I lurked for many moons before I made the decision to get serious about it  Good luck with your struggles ,F50

I wish you the best life   You will have a beautiful life  because it's the only one you've got and you're doing really well for yourself    ,F50
Congrats it seems like you made a lot of progress in the last year   Would you mind explaining your thoughts and feelings at 90 days and the urges you still felt ,F50
Please take care  Pancreatitis is no joke  It is one of the worst pain that one can feel   I think you know this by now    Stay sober and maintain your diet  You'll be good ,F50
  What I do not like and appreciate is the blame we sometimes take from religious zealots if we don't necessary assimilate whatever they say   Could you elaborate on this   I'm not sure what it means with respect to this conversation ,F50
Plants   We like them   Also forklifts,F50
Congrats on over 2 years  ,F50

"""I hit rock bottom when I stopped digging ""  I love this quote  Though my drinking could have gotten much worse  I put down the shovel and took the ladder that was offered to me   I will not drink today with you all  ",F50

Good job man  Keep growing and developing yourself  Maybe you could provide some details about your experience ,F50
Riding out the urge is tough  but we must remember the urge doesn't last for long  A lot of us are good at procrastination  so we can use that skill for good by delaying ourselves from watching  which leads to the urge leaving ,F50
I will not drink today  The month of January is going to be one of change for us at work but we don't know how  what or who will be affected  I will not let fear of the unknown take over  ,F50

"I had to focus on the similarities in other people's stories and not the differences  The differences are just my ""yets""  the things I haven't done yet ",F50

I will not drink today ,F50
The good thing about not drinking  is that you can react to those situations in much better ways when you're sober  as compared to when you aren't  ,F50
Nope   Been binging over 10 years  Approximate amount varies  3 bottles of wine to whole bottles of vodka  ,F50
Yes we can  I'm aiming for 30 days too coz then I hope the habit is broken    Edit  not suggesting I'll start again after 30 days  Just want a less scary goal for now  ,F50
Congratulations on the new job  and thank you for the work you do  Thanks for being here and sharing your experiences with us too  ,F50

Switzerland is my favorite country  which I have visited in my life  ,F50
yeah fuckin A that's bang on what happened to me every relapse ,F50
I learned there is a quieter  patient  more thoughtful  and considerate person under all the boozy bravado  I learned that when I don't constantly seek other's approval  I leave some space to work on being a better me  ,F50
I am not drinking today  ,F50
Staying strong and I will not drink today ,F50

Hope things are getting a little easier for you   Hang in there   We've got your back ,F50
Way to go  there's some great honesty here ,F50
Defense looked at little better against city but don't disagree that it is the Achilles ankle of Liverpool ,F50
yeah netflix marathon FTW  literally only thing i could do for 4 days  too sick to even get up and score   edit  all of the suggestions here are excellent  big fan of loud music  got really into Macklemore on this recent kick ,F50
So sorry to hear this  Sobriety might not help get it back  but it will help with this not happening again  Best wishes ,F50
Oh my  me too  One that doesn't always have to worry about my next move  ,F50
I think Merkel was feeling the heat from her immigration policies and had to throw a bone to the fascists ,F50
Macklemore   Starting Over ,F50
Interesting that the urges came back strong after almost half a year   You mentioned that you have made a lot of progress but how are the urges if they arise now and what actions do you take to cope with them ,F50
  Johny Cash   Hurt  I think you mean Nine Inch Nails   ,F50
Yaaas girl  5 months sounds like forever from where I'm standing  so thanks for the encouragement that it can be done  GO YOU ,F50
It's surprisingly easy to quit  just make sure you do something during the times that you normally smoke so you never think about it  ,F50
I'm right there with you  It's my day 2 also  I will not drink with you today ,F50
Yeah  I hate changing phone services  Of course they know that too  Maybe call up Verizon and tell them you are switching unless they offer a discount  Sometimes works   ,F50
My kids start back at school tomorrow morning    in 23 5 hours   but now   to survive today ,F50
Thank you  I considered that last night or the night before I can't remember  but Im just so afraid of admitting this to him or anyone  I am going to get through today and go to AA meeting as soon as I can ,F50
In those first two months of sobriety I had thick brain fog that forced me to keep lists to remember many trivial types of things  My brain fog lifted on day 53  Best wishes ,F50
Well fuck  that defeats my whole argument  Cheers to your mom ,F50
Joel MAtip is pretty good at Centre back  And  you still have Steven Caulker  a Tottenham youth trained defender    and for some reason Caulker never gets gametime  like never  It's so weird  because he's a very good defender  ,F50
I have recently doubled my SSRI dosage after about 3 years on the same dosage  as told to by a doctor    its been about 3 weeks since i doubled the dosage though thought they shouldve taken effect by now,F50
One thing I'm starting to appreciate is that a constitution means whatever the people who are willing to ignore it want it too mean if they are in the majority   Consider Japanese internment camps in the US ,F50
I will not drink today ,F50
I know you can do it  I personally listened to recovery podcasts my entire first day and it helped tremendously  I'm almost at a week  no urges whatsoever  and feeling great  Just know that you are not alone in this journey ,F50
hmm  sorry to hear that  this is the first time we've tried giving away promo codes for an in app purchase  Its quite a new thing from Apple ,F50
How's it going so far OP ,F50
Congratulations  This is very inspiring    There's nothing quite as sad as seeing a person stay the exact same after many years  Especially when they don't even enjoy where they are  Lack of personal development ,F50
I think Merkel was doing an incredibly humanitarian act  yet some pencil chaser slipped that in on the side  ,F50

I will not drink with you today  SD  No matter what happens  I will not drink  Day 9  here I come  ,F50
speaking for myself   my attempts to quit kept me drunk and sick  As hard as it seems  SURRENDER to any power greater than me is the only thing that worked   I don't drink  I surrender  That's it   ,F50

Remember 1 day at the time  ,F50
Well  the dosage and amount she's using does in reality matter most of all  The rest of it is subjective moralizing  Sorry  just my two cents   Just try being gentle and understanding with her  And    communicate ,F50
It's going to be a great year  ,F50
You don't have to apologize for the the length of any post  We are so happy to have you sharing with us   Welcome  back  to the ride of your life  and the best group of people to weather through it with  ,F50

Hes a Very angry drunk  You guys gotta keep an eye him  And although he called me out you dont see me doing the same  I dont know how thats OK here M ,F50
I have to remember that every day I don't smoke is a win   It is overwhelming because I feel like I've lost part of my identity    but that is not a bad thing at all ,F50
Random drug testing   Kidding  I'm a photographer or something ,F50

Been quite a few days now   Feels like an eternity   Seemed impossible at day 3 but getting to visit the family  after a year  has definitely helped too  I will not drink again  I will not drink with you today ,F50
I relate to all of this op  mostly I'm struggling with a lack of direction  I've never known what I wanted from life  any time anything peaks my interest I get bored eventually and make excuses not to persue it ,F50
My brother is vegetarian and used to order McDonalds cheeseburgers without the meat ,F50
You can't force someone else to quit    he has to take the steps himself or it will not work    sorry    ,F50
Sorry to hear this  but yeah  sounds about par for the course  Kratom is such an absolute bitch  ,F50
Then why do you want to quit if it's so great  ,F50
Check the side bar of this sub  you can download This Naked Mind for free  ,F50
Are you doing a stable scheduled and measured taper  It sounds kind of chaotic  I could see how that would just throw your whole system into a state ,F50
Hope you did it  It was my first day too and I did not drink with you  Not drinking with you today either    ,F50
Do you know 'about' how many teaspoon 20 grams is  I still haven't gotten a scale  Im stuck on my taper  Holidays didnt help  Reading all these posts scare me since Im a long time user  9 years  ugh  ,F50
  A sexually abusive relationship     An undiagnosed anxiety disorder     How poorly I was balancing my life because of the two,F50

I'd happily use it once or twice a week  But I know I'd get into a mind set where I was just trying to get through the shitty non kratom days  It's so not worth it ,F50
I will not drink today ,F50
Sounds almost like she's on extracts   that for sure is not good  I would just ask her nicely without attacking  us addicts can be very defensive ,F50

Good job  and great advice,F50
It may be to much medicine and your body still adjusting to being without buds  Stay strong and talk to your doctor's again  Suicidal homicidal thoughts are side effects of ssri type meds ,F50

Yup  including one from myself a few weeks ago   ,F50
i have really gotten into skincare  so I splurge on products or services  when i was drinking i could barely look in the mirror  After 5 weeks i find my skin is looking better and I am sure the extra attention is helping a lot  ,F50
This  Having one drink has zero appeal to me  In fact  it sounds awful because it means that I'd have to stop myself after one  Zero is so much easier than one ,F50
Well done my friend  well done indeed ,F50

You FUCKING POSEUR    OMG S   What a FUCKING LOSER  ,F50

You've got this    Keep that liver happy   ,F50

Add me please   Here's to turning over a new leaf in 2017 ,F50
I'll eventually post more detailed stuff here  but so far reading through what other people are dealing with has given me great perspective on the situation  ,F50

Great advice   ,F50
Yesterday I was in the grocery store  While everyone else appeared to by buying kale and bananas  I was buying chips  gum  sunflower seeds  hot cocoa mix   ,F50
Thank you for responding  it's good to know someone is out there  I do feel pretty alone right now and drinking to blot out boredom and loneliness has always been a problem for me ,F50
The anger was just over the top though  Like  jfc have the sense to admit when you're wrong    ,F50

I wasted yesterday and don't want to feel that way again    I am excited with you and certainly won't be drinking with you   ,F50

Very nice   Congratulations and thanks for your posts and insight ,F50
Kid  props to you for managing to not only blend in with one addict sub  but mod one as well    It takes effort    I mean you don't know shit about shit  but you went far ,F50

It really worked out stellar   And apparently they have my shoes   I just have to go trade them for the slippers ,F50
Yeah I figured there was no certain answer to this  It probably varies between people too  I guess I'll just have to wait and find out ,F50
I hear you  I guess it's all about that thing I'm no good at  moderation ,F50
Great thoughts   Thanks for that ,F50
I'm with you all the way   I have almost zero motivation as well   But I'm convinced there's light at the end of the tunnel   Hang in there  buddy ,F50

Thanks for this  as a newbie its really good to have people who've gone through it reinforce that even if it's not easy  it's worth it ,F50

"Sounds like a great time   I love the Mountain Goats and that song   ""No Children"" is another one that I love  not as a celebration of the self destruction but kind of a catharsis  ",F50

Gabapentin used with Clonidine works quite well,F50
Lol I'm native too    Wtf  ,F50
Stay strong  It is always one day at a time  The people here are on your side  Keep it up  ,F50
You're real friends will still be there for you   3 This has been my experience  Anyone else who doesn't want to be around you because you're sober doesn't deserve to be  Do this for you  who cares what anyone else thinks  ,F50
Thanks I appreciate the support here   ,F50
That's true too  I'm trying to keep that in perspective ,F50
"What does ""I'm a donut"" mean    And you've got this ",F50

I have been a donut several times  I know how great I feel when I have been sober for a few months and then for some stupid reason I blow it again and have to start over  Thankfully Today I am not drinking along with you ,F50
Honestly  I can't recommend that book enough   I got it for several friends who aren't necessarily dealing with addicted loved ones  but even just strong personalities   It was life changing for me ,F50
"Thanks bro  we got this  I just had my first ""time to buy weed"" impulsive thought  Gotta get out of that mindset",F50

I could always tell when I was having a bad day when my NOMO last checkin was less than a day ago     ,F50
Happy One Year  Bad    Yay o Yay for you   ,F50
Thank you  Congrats on 61 days  It's great to hear you're doing better with anxiety since quitting  I can't wait ,F50
Again  because their daily reality might be denied in some respect  going to alateen meetings will allow them to be around people who are living similarly and will instantly validate them ,F50
I've been having dreams like that too  It's shameful but it is definitely wonderful to wake up still on the sober streak,F50
Good luck  What a awesome New Years resolution  ,F50
Thanks for letting us know   I just checked it and it works on the web  might be a mobile issue   You can search NA beer in the SD search bar  too  that may take you to posts about it ,F50

Awesome    Congratulations on Nine Sober Solar Circumnavigations ,F50

She was infatuated with the needle    Can't blame her really  I'll take IV Ativan over the pills any day  ,F50
I met some of my best Sober Friends at meetings   I found meetings all over  and made lots of new buddies ,F50
Up all night  Blasting OPIvY and the neighbors don't like it  I turned it up  Waiting for the cops to come   ,F50
Yay  Congrats to you as well    Coffee Cheers   Side note  I've found that Ginger Beer at a bar is a really damn good alternative to beer beer ,F50
Take a look at Alateen   http   www al anon alateen org for alateen,F50
More nuanced than that  It seems to be fine after about a week and only once  ,F50
There you are  I won't drink today ,F50
Nice job man  Hope to join you   soon ,F50
Personally I think very quick taper is effective in reducing some of the initial symptoms  By this i mean 2 3 days max before quitting completely ,F50
Sounds a solid plan  Getting up  ready  washed and out even for a quick walk is something positive  What you thinking of doing with the day ,F50
We're not alone  We're all together in this   I share your heartache and pain  ,F50
Glad you're here   I spoke to a counselor  she recommended meetings   I went and met lots of great people  got support  tools  resources and fellowship   They're always doing some sober activities     Tried any meetings ,F50

Good stuff   keep going  For me it was really hard first two weeks with cravings  then I've been through a 'sad' patch and now I'm starting to feel really good  ,F50
Great   Waking up sober is awesome  and even better  is  going to sleep  sober ,F50
To start I ate a lot of spicy food and put nailpolish remover on my hands to make purging taste terrible and feel painful  The following heartburn made binging less likely    That was just until I got into DBT therapy   ,F50
Great Post   Happy New Year Mouse  ,F50
Totes  And drinking permeates the industry of coding design  I see this more and more especially now that I have a different perspective  It's very much a part of the culture  http   alistapart com column does our industry have a drinking problem,F50
So the always thinking about weed goes away ,F50
Glad you're here   I spoke to a counselor   She recommended meetings   I went and got immediate support  tools  resources and fellowship   I've never been happier ,F50

I am right there with you   Started off my morning with yogurt  2 glasses of water  and my first yoga class in 8 months ,F50
Thanks   Excellent piece of writing  ,F50
Ounces would be helpful if you were made out of flour and we intended to bake a cake with your flesh,F50
No such thing as one last time   I'd give anything to enjoy opiates in moderation but I can't  We have to accept that it's all or nothing for people like us    Good luck with sobriety this time round    ,F50
Shockingly   I went to the movies    All I remember was the screen was big and the characters assholes  ,F50

"Yeah but it says may   Not like smokes which have causes cancer on the package   Honest label for alcohol would be ""addictive as shit  causes liver failure with time  and withdrawals are a cunt  Also increases your risk for certain cancers """,F50
There is really no rule about how we introduce ourselves at meetings  ,F50
And of course from a purely financial point of view imagine how much money you are saving by not having a single dime go to the complete waste of money that is alcohol  ,F50
Yeah  I realized that  My bender may not have lasted this long but due to the holiday season family obligations I had to keep up till right before NYE  ,F50
It's always up to you ,F50
Glad to see you forgave yourself  One thing I am horrible at and still working on  Hope your 2017 year is awesome ,F50

They might catch alight at a steady going rate     ah  actually they won't ,F50
Good afternoon   Made it 500 so I think I'll manage another day without alcohol,F50

Good luck with the cleaning endeavor  ,F50
I don't have much advice   Just here to tell you that it should quickly get better   Drink a ton of water and consider daily supplements   ,F50
As already mentioned  in the early days I avoided gatherings for which one of the primary purposes was alcohol consumption   I also didn't unnecessarily test myself   But that's me ,F50
One day at a time  I won't drink with you guys today ,F50
Yes  but it felt like such work    Not really looking forward to tonight when I have to be back at work tomorrow morning  but it can't be any worse than the first night ,F50

If going cold turkey is hard  maybe try weaning it down to maybe one joint a day ,F50
Reality I learned in inpatient  Alcohol can kill you if you go cold turkey  opiates make you wish that they did  Other drugs are similar  but to a lesser extent ,F50

They are temporary  You got this   I will not drink with you today ,F50
Thank you   ,F50

Yup  day two resolutioner over here as well  Not drinking with the both of you today ,F50
You right nothing can be flawless  Just discussing ideas  sometimes if problems are identified they can be avoided or minimised  The idea has the potential to help some ,F50
Glad you're part of the Community ,F50
Awesome  And indeed  returning back to the madness at work tomorrow will suck much less without a hangover  Thanks ,F50
Glad you're here     I don't have any romantic memories of being Impaired ,F50
I meant GAD  Science is now showing the gut is the 2nd leading producer of some neurotransmitters  such as serotonin  related to gad and once believed to exist only in the brain ,F50
Great outlook   I will not drink with you today ,F50
"Nah you're still great  just not ""her great"" apparently  Good luck with today  hope it isn't too bad ",F50
Sure  there are many different systems people use to keep track ,F50

I've just hit 24 hours too  You can do this ,F50
Yes  exactly falling off the wagon is easy  But getting back is not ,F50
No problem  Good luck to all of us in 2017 ,F50
Just drive  It will begin to feel natural soon ,F50
Indeed   I only go to bars now when there's a reason other than a drink involved  ,F50
Yes  I once read a book that said It is not the smoking that is bad  it is the addiction which is bad ,F50
I'm not drinking tonight either ,F50
Nice  that just sounds like a normal gag reflex vomit  Sounds like you've been taking care of yourself    ,F50

Nine years  Bring out the dancing cows  Congratulations ,F50

PS   who are you cheering for in the Rose Bowl ,F50

Indeed I shall not be watching GoT for quite some time ,F50
Nice work and congratulations on the personal recognition  ,F50
Yes it enables a lot of things  It changes you from someone passive to someone who goes out there and gets what he wants  ,F50
Yeah  that's what it seemed like to me too  But still  Hahaha  ,F50
Thanks  I needed this  Perfect timing ,F50

Just a fuck ton of their  they're and there to parse here    Jesus fuck  buy a grammar dictionary for 2017    Good luck Fucky  ,F50
I believe it is to follow the AA  as in being sober for X days  ,F50

We can't answer this question   you really need a dr and don't let warrants cost you your life   ,F50
This is a medical question  Only a doctor can adequately assess your detox needs  ,F50
Thanks  Liz   I've appreciated your presence and input on this sub on my journey ,F50
Oh yes it truly is  And the good thing is that I don't even regret anything  Not everything was bad and because of the stopgaming experience I am sensitive to all the good things that are around me but I was blind to see before  ,F50
I doubt you'll have anything other than mild anxiety or difficulty falling asleep  If you're really worried you should ask your doctor though  we are not medical professionals  Best wishes ,F50
Very interesting  Thanks for the explanation ,F50
Sounds like a good way to start the year  refocused with a clear vision from re learning a lesson you needed to have   Best of luck for 2017,F50

Do you drink any caffeinated beverages  Nicotine affects the rate at which caffeine is metabolised  ,F50

Thank you again and you're right  everyone can overcome anything if they put their minds to it  Appreciate you  ,F50
Where did you do your graduate studies  if you don't mind me asking  ,F50
Normally  I wouldn't  Having the person you spent almost everyday with for roughly 4 years think that you're a waste of life  makes it a bit tougher  But there's no point in letting it wear me down anymore   ,F50
You can take it back  I believe in you  I won't drink with you today ,F50
Way to aggressive for me  Sorry ,F50

Awesome  Do you want a one year medallion mailed to you ,F50
I thought it was the addiction that we are trying to beat  if we're back to square one neuro wise  that still doesn't implies we lost all the time we have devoted till now ,F50
"It doesn't work  imo  You can't really avoid the withdrawal  That would be like ""avoiding the thc from leaving your system""  If you're gonna quit  it's gonna happen  But you don't die though  ",F50

I miss it but have also forgotten what it feels like  Addiction is strange  ,F50
That's really a personal preference  Some people announce it on social media  others tell no one ,F50
Please be respectful  It's against sub rules that link to sites that sell things,F50
It will pass  You just   drive without smoking  To this day once in a while i will get an urge when I get in the car but it's like once a month maybe  Less than that  even  It just goes away ,F50
Wait that's not Zach Galifianakis  ,F50
If you stop now  you have much less to worry about  Cops will often watch for a while before making a move on you  ,F50
Time is a resource  They also strongly encourage donations  The founders of AA accidentally stumbled upon group therapy which requires a group and therefore new members  Not to mention recruitment is baked into step 12 ,F50
I told my wife right away  my family a few weeks later  and everyone else as needed without making a huge proclamation about it   ,F50

Always forget about that one,F50
Woo hoo  Sometimes we have to learn the hard way ,F50
  But if I never go back then they never catch me and get a chance to use it   Exactly this    ,F50
Sorry to hear you are also having this problem  Don't give up  you can change  I have been sober for almost 2 weeks now and I still have cravings  but having a clear sober mind  and healthy body is worth it ,F50

Four years  Nice work ,F50

Good luck on the rest of your journey ,F50
Thank you for this  it gives me hope  You should be proud of yourself  ,F50
Don't take it personally   the new crowd has turned this sub to shit    Used to be fun here   ,F50

I believe it is possible  but we need to make some changes to the app first I think due to the way Google have implemented promo codes  ,F50
Immodium is the brand name  Lope is generic ,F50

My dick is like 6 and 1 2 inches and every chick I've fucked bleeds and screams because of the girth  Kind of a bummer  Also it looks like a thumb sticking out of a blueberry bush when its soft ,F50
If it's not red or itching by now  you're probably okay ,F50
It is nice  although I'm still worried about having to explain myself in more one on one situations  We were all drinking out of cups that you can't see through so no one even knew I didn't have a drink  Only me and my boyfriend  ,F50
No  it had been seventeen days when I left the hospital  Its been four months now    Thank you though   I appreciate the good wishes ,F50

Therapists are confidential  meaning you can tell them anything and then never even have to see that person again  I think it could be good practice for you to open up ,F50

Casually smoking is what made me lose a whole seven months of progress  It went from one or two cigs a day to a carton a week    You got this though ,F50
If you have trouble giving it up  you're addicted  I can only talk about quitting smoking  but cold turkey was the only thing that ever worked for me   ,F50
Welcome   I've found taking things one day at a time to be of real benefit  I start each day by promising myself that I won't drink that day  I've done that for the last 360 or so days in succession ,F50

I took valium for 10 days to deal with my withdrawal and that helped so much   I'm 2 months in and I feel alot clearer but I do get the feeling of smoking after the tolerance break  Might wait and only smoke on 4 20,F50
That sounds really similar to how I wind up in picking spells  If I'm not busy  then I tend to start picking or mindlessly eating  all  great  coping strategies for boredom and anxiety lol  ,F50
"Thought of a few more that I see regularly    ""How do I tell my friends I'm not drinking""  ""Can I still go out with my friends when they're drinking and I'm not""  ""How do I stop drinking when my SO still drinks ""  ",F50
Well hang in there my friend   I'll not drink with you today ,F50
Well  the ability to log cravings for me was the absolute key  Instead of thinking about grabbing a smoke  it gave me a substitute behavior  logging cravings  It was what did the trick  I quit cold turkey ,F50
I choose every day to avoid drinking  I don't worry about yesterday and tomorrow will take care of tomorrow  Today I also will not drink with you ,F50
I spoke with a counselor   She recommended meetings   I went and got support from people who understand  got tools  resources and fellowship   I've not looked back ,F50
Well  to paraphrase Freud  sometimes a headache is just a headache  but have you tried neck stretches   I used to get terrible tension headaches  but once I started doing neck stretches they magically went away   ,F50
thats why im here  the anxiety and depression and lethargy of a constant hangover is the most boring hell,F50
Thanks    ,F50
I spoke with a counselor   She recommended meetings   I went and got support from people who understand  got tools  resources and fellowship   I've not looked back ,F50

You clearly don't know me or my history here    Cooooooooooooooooool,F50
I spoke with a counselor   She recommended meetings   I went and got support from people who understand  got tools  resources and fellowship   I've not looked back ,F50
A traumatic thing to witness  that's for sure  Like others here I was just in a sober car accident and was so relieved to not have been drinking  A minor inconvenience could have been a fucking nightmare  Be grateful and take it easy ,F50
Haha that's funny  My body is pretty weird and can't handle nicotine but just the action is helping me not be so bored,F50
One year as of January 8th    No alcohol   Yay    ,F50
 Patiently waiting    ,F50
What was your other username  ,F50
Like    too many too list    Jax is all you need  Either you know the name or you don't  ,F50
Hahaha thanks for this  Good advice and humor is exactly what I need right now ,F50
I spoke with a counselor   She recommended meetings   I went and got support from people who understand  got tools  resources and fellowship   I've not looked back ,F50
Nice one   ,F50

Wow    Great Job  ,F50
Yeah I may just stick to tapering the lope the next few days and just abandon kratom altogether I feel pretty good today and don't think I need my two schedule doses today  What do you think ,F50
Really hits you when you dont consider yourself a smoker until you realise you've been lying to yourself for years  and im only 23  I have anxiety and obsessive tendancies so i think its one huge mixing pot  Im in real estate so the pressures quite high,F50
I spoke with a counselor   She recommended meetings   I went and got support from people who understand  got tools  resources and fellowship   I've not looked back ,F50
No need to sound all defensive about it ,F50
Well  this is my only place for that  and it does a good job  ,F50
What a Lovely Palindrome ,F50
Thank you very much   I plan on it  ,F50

Congratulations on your Sober Solar Circumnavigation ,F50
I spoke with a counselor   She recommended meetings   I went and got support from people who understand  got tools  resources and fellowship   I've not looked back ,F50
Congrats on your Sober Solar Circumnavigation ,F50
I've got 1 hour 45 before it's a new day  They've just started kicking off again upstairs  It's been hours since I had that drink  I don't want another  It's hilarious listening to them  I'd quite like to go sleep though  ,F50
Congrats  That a big deal ,F50
 I never woke up regretting not drinking   Thanks for the saying  exactly what I needed,F50
I haven't tried neck stretches   How long were you having these headaches for  I have them all day literally lol ,F50
You made one full day  You can do the second one as well  ,F50
I spoke with a counselor   She recommended meetings   I went and got support from people who understand  got tools  resources and fellowship   I've not looked back ,F50
  know people who casually smoke   That's how we all started  ,F50
Thank you  that means a lot and I hope you are having a good day ,F50
The badge helps me stay accountable to myself  typing out responses helps me clarify my thoughts on sobriety related issues   hopefully helps others with the same concerns  and reading posts from newcomers reminds me what I was like when I had to quit ,F50
"This might sound bad  but reading the badge resets help me the most   Sometimes you think ""maybe i don't have a problem  one couldn't hurt""   When i read those  they remind me that it is not worth the risk  ",F50
That is fantastic   ,F50
I'm still dirty  you ain't missing anything  Would love to just have a normal shit  ,F50
Nicely done   ,F50
Experience  strength  and hope  ,F50
No  but you're just as addicted as square one   You can measure progress however you want  but it helps to educate yourself about the science of it   Knowing how it works helps a lot   Get science on your side  ,F50
Little late but I'm here ,F50
Dude sometimes this will happen to me and I'll blow a load in my sleep  Weirdest thing to wake up to,F50
It depends  It's hard to tell  but I'd say no  Weed likes to stick around  ,F50
Don't be ashamed about it dude  you can't control your dreams,F50
For me  the anger  rage in my case  and depression  deep  empty soul feeling for me  is the worst part and why I relapsed in the past  ,F50
I got pulled over once for swerving when this happened  Fortunately the cop understood  but it will be nice to not worry about it ,F50
I get the big bag of generic cough drops  Get the menthol ones  ,F50
Hurts like a bitch to sit on it so I've been running around all day cleaning and cooking   I'm pretty sure I'll live ,F50
great and exactly what i am going through,F50
 I close my eyes  only for a moment then the moment's gone    ,F50

Actually  I think you need to find some male nurse boy toy to look after it ,F50
I've written about my two realisations here https   www reddit com r stopdrinking comments 5lnw32 how i managed christmas and new years with no ,F50
Thanks for the advice  I will not drink with you today ,F50
Your tale sounds frighteningly familiar   I'm starting to realize that just because I have    days under my belt  that it's way too easy and way too damaging to fall back into that old pattern   Thanks ,F50
"Tapering sounds so nice    ""I'll just dial it back and go skipping on my way ""  Were it only so easy ",F50
Congrats  Cheers to many more smoke free years ,F50
Have you tried just taking 1 a day   Would that maybe help equal out the solid to liquid ratio  ,F50
Just relapsed right now  Take me off the list ,F50
Totally agree   When in doubt  just replace porn with heroine crack meth   My husband and I just had the same conversation like 3 mins ago   ,F50
There's no civility in CA    We drink mouthwash and shit our pants  And if imma take my dick out  Imma use it  ,F50
Checking in  Best of luck to everyone ,F50
"""Have hope  not expectations""  adding that to my list of mantras  Thank you    ",F50
I'm 26    Also you need to replace that smoking a cig thing with something else  for example I replace smoking a cig with making a tea    I'm drink tea in last month like hell  better than smoking ,F50
This hits too close to home for me  It seems any stupid thing I've done has been while under the influence  so if I remove the one constant then real change should occur  I'm going to a program this Friday called Celebrate Recovery ,F50
I will not drink today ,F50
Yay for extra cat cuddling  I suggest having a plan for when cravings strike  there's lots of great suggestions around this site   Keep up the good work ,F50
Yes  that is right  knowing the science behind always helps the cause ,F50
Me too  and it's a very effective one   ,F50
Keep it up  There will be some days that are harder than others but you can do this  ,F50
Thank you  I just got to go through it  there's no way around it except to go through,F50
I did    And it's terrifying to think what could've happened  Genuinely terififyng  It's amazing the mental gymnastics one can preform to justify it  ,F50
Just sold out   BLS and Sabbath are all that's left  ,F50
Maybe a crisis line  Maybe sit still  Know it won't last forever  Day 6 here so I totally understand  I'm here to support you the best I can  This Entire sub will support you  ,F50
Thanks man  you as well ,F50
Congrats on your century  Glad you are sober ,F50

Hang in there man  Sounds like you have a lot on your plate   Day 1 for me   I won't drink with you today  ,F50

he actually wrote we dont talk about post drinking shits     i  i  cant  i cant  ,F50
Whenever I had problems with my neighbours' antisocial behaviour  I contacted the noise abatement team  the police and my landlord  I also kept a log of all the disturbances  Four months is a long time to put up with this shit ,F50
"In all honestly though I completely understand the sentiment behind your post  I've had to do a lot of court mandated rehabilitation bullshit and all I hear half the fucking time is ""I've puked more than you've drank kid """,F50
It's not something to be ashamed of  it's a disease and you're taking steps to treat it  Your English is very good  by the way,F50
Good job   Keep up the great work   You are an inspiration,F50
Those are some great suggestions   I would add that using this site for support can be a HUGE help  reading and commenting on others going through the same struggles was really helpful for me  Congrats on your success so far  Keep it up ,F50
sure  best wishes for those applications ,F50
Eventually  yes  There are good days and bad days  But gradually the times you are thinking about it begin to be outnumbered by the times you're not ,F50
Fridays after work is one of my triggers  but I can genuinely say that I don't find drinking relaxing  I just persuade myself that I do over the course of Friday afternoon  ,F50
I think distraction is going to be my best bet  The less time I spend thinking about not smoking  the less I want one  ,F50
My butt generally hurts when I drink ,F50
The only way past it is through it  Your body is going through a lot getting past this addiction  so be kind to yourself  Congrats on day one of your non smoking life ,F50
Yes was nice   Yes   that did suck ,F50
That's so awesome  Well done  Caribbean vacation to boot  And I thought the standard Christmas dinner was hard  Way to go ,F50

It took about the first month for the 'beer o'clock' thoughts to disappear  Leisure time is now spent doing a whole variety of things from spending time with family  and being present   cycling  trombone playing  reading   walking  ,F50
Considering he lives in an igloo  that's doubtful    I just moved from KC and believe it or not  there are people who want the name of the team changed  Same with the Redskins  etc  ,F50
No problem   Glad I can help   Have a good nights sleep  ,F50
This  Just  Yes  This and Handcuffs  Just the whole fucking album  ,F50
I'm sorry you're suffering  I know how much it sucks  The only sobriety I have is today  Nothing else counts ,F50
2017 holds a magical Power at this point  Hope it works out for us all ,F50
Glad you're here commenting  You're doing yourself a huge favor  and I hope abstaining makes your 2017 that much better  Good luck   ,F50
I always thought boss was slang for cops  Where I'm from that's what people call cops when you're in Jail  ,F50
Mmm   not a bad idea actually ,F50
I think I am going to do the same with my primary care doctor and find someone else  The way he acted when I opened up to him about drinking made me feel awful  I dread going in for anything  ,F50
Thank you  I'll see you around  Enjoy the sunset   ,F50
I am  in fact  the best ,F50
Oh I'm sure I will before long,F50
Thank you for your comment  I'm not a spiritual man  so I hope I can find something to give me the serenity you feel today  All the best to you and see you around ,F50
Strong work right here ,F50
it all depends  If you dont do it a lot it could clear out fast  I would buy fake urine  you can get it at headshops and some gas stations ,F50
I'll absolutely do all of that  Thank you for your kind words and all the best to you too ,F50
Great job  I hope that 2017 gives you a life beyond your wildest dreams  ,F50
This is a good place to be  I will not drink with you today ,F50
Congratulations for both the 100 days and for having the courage to it took to share  My biggest fear is that I'll one day get complacent and think I can just have one and I think hearing stories like yours will help me avoid it  thank you ,F50
I just passed the day 4 mark  I'm using anything to pass the cravings  Food  cinnamon sticks  chanting  apps  We can do this  So worth it   Try the Smoke Free app  It is helping me ,F50
I'd give it some time before having a fap if your counter is correct  Atleast 2 weeks and ideally a month to help sensitivity go back to normal ,F50
Hope we don't have to wait a year for the next installment    ,F50

This sounds like alcohol withdrawal  Your doctor is the best person to evaluate your detox needs  ,F50
Why do people in the south call a pen a pin ,F50
Take a water bottle with a straw built in with you  Take drags of water whenever you feel you'd naturally take a drag off a cigarette  Muscle memory is a big part of driving and you've trained yourself to have that hand mouth thing incorporated  ,F50
Thanks  I got the link from the Smoke Free app  Will be using this a lot in the coming days and weeks ,F50
It does a great service  but it's too religion oriented to many ,F50
I only count 2 total  1 of which is wrong  50  isnt great  but with that small a sample size hard to find a noteworthy trend  particularly in this age of autocorrect   Maybe ur just a bit too pickled for parsing atm ,F50
Benzos plus booze in small amounts will not kill you  despite what the fearmongers say    However  it will totally throw off your taper  You can't cut back accurately if you have 2 variables like that  ,F50
Actually recently unpacked some of boxes of books from my childhood room and there were a couple bibles in there    I stored them next to my Dawkins ,F50

Hearing this stuff is kinda scary  From my perspective  anything under 8 grams or so seems like such a small daily dose  People are talking about reducing by  1 g day    I guess I will need a scale after all  ,F50
Luckily I withhold that joy for the next morning   It really makes the drinking experience a life experience  ,F50
I'm really glad you lucked out and found somebody cool to help you out ,F50
How much were u taking when u started your taper and how fast have you gone  ,F50
Awesome        That's really great and you are an inspiration for all of us    ,F50

Been vaping for around a year and just dropped it yesterday  I weened down a little but honestly I think the best way is to just cut it off  get over the first couple days  and be done with it,F50

I was sober when this happened  I've never injured myself when drunk luckily  But your case sounds horrifying  I'm sorry that happened to you  I'm terrified that it could be me years later if I don't break this cycle right now ,F50
You're over the worst hump  You've got this  ,F50
"This is the best feeling  Knowing you have and can say no when around friends family smoking  Just dont go ""i did it before i can treat myself this time"" you will most likely fall back to the same routine  atleast i do ",F50
Me too  Good Job ,F50
You must be a cunt then  it can't be me  ,F50
It's very uncommon  I looked into basically every residential treatment center in the country  and this was the only one that let you in the kitchen to prepare your own food  Good luck ,F50
I prefer Fentanyl  ,F50
I hope to god you never have to go through what I have fighting alcohol addiction and I don't even know you  That is how bad it can be  that you wish a complete stranger never has to walk in your shoes ,F50
You are banned from  r pyongyang  ,F50
Basically  if you check this account in two weeks  you won't ever see another post from it  ,F50
I always love reading your posts ,F50
Hey man that's great  I have 2 days and I don't see myself getting the hang of it again  But I will continue to call my sponsor and go to meetings  Keep it up man  Never again ,F50
First off  welcome  Second  I'd recommend figuring out what your triggers are  What sets a picking episode off  Once you figure that out  tips and tricks will be easier to find    Edit  a word,F50
Very soon  I'll never forget feeling like a 90 year old     I would just keep pushing   Do not use bc of this symptom  It will pass ,F50
Just had a look and its not available OTC in UK  theres alternatives on Amazon but reviews are a bit hit and miss and i think they aren't really what im after ,F50
"Just recently started getting tatted out myself  What all you got  So I got the quote ""I'm just trying to be somebody I can talk to in the morning with a smile"" Have an appointment on thursday for my first piece of art ",F50
Did you seriously IV that shit and survive  How much did you IV    EDIT  I'm serious about the suicide  I'm thinking about getting some Carfentanil  ,F50
You and me both man  Made it through my boozed up familys holiday shindigs  Let's keep going,F50
Op is a fucking wack job smhh,F50
I may have misinterpreted the article over on NoFap  but I think there's a difference between a reset and a relapse  http   www nofap com rebooting,F50
thank you for responding  we all have our woe is me moments    definitely telling myself to be patient  sometimes feels like time is moving very slowly since I quit  hope you're doing well      ,F50
wow  we have the same story      ,F50
Good luck  man  We're all in this together  My detox is similar  You got this  fam  It's not easier  but literally just keep coming back here  and keep talking to us  It's been helping me like crazy  ,F50
Drop me  Streak lasted seven days  but had a reset ,F50
How's the cravings   I'm at Day 8 and my cravings have become manageable  ,F50
Thanks  My ex was mad cuz I don't send him flicks  We're kinda fuck buddies now  It's just not the damn same  Ah well  my cocktail is working wonders  Off to bed now  ,F50
Sad part is at one point I was probably spending close to that a month on a ground up freaking tree leaf   I was clearly a dumbass ,F50
I've got more Scotch to drink though  Sorry bud  ,F50
I noticed that whenever I quit  while the nicotine is still in my body  I'll like the smell of someone that just smoked or of smoke in general  Once the initial cravings are gone the smell will become gross  ,F50
Well that is odd  ,F50
Congratulations  How did you do it  ,F50
Has anyone been to Avalon Hills ,F50
I love that program I been doing it for months and have gotten a lot stronger   This program and not drinking has improved my golf game and life in so many positive ways ,F50
Definitely  sobriety first  success in all facets later  ,F50
Omg  I did the purse thing too   So embarrassing to think about that now   ,F50
Congrats on one week  You've got this ,F50
Me and you both  Congrats comrade  ,F50
What you do now ,F50
Welcome  we're glad to have you    ,F50
I'm microwaving a Fentanyl patch on a burrito right now  I hope to eat it in a few seconds and not wake up to scum like yourself  ,F50
It could be a gateway to the internet  so I'd get rid of them  but that's just me ,F50
"The thing is  my dear  you will wake up to ""scum"" like us  ",F50
Ah  good call ,F50
10 years on  2 days off   Coughing yellow phlegm every 15 minutes or so   I'm expecting that  day 20 I'll be breathing like a normal person   Or else I have lung cancer   Hm ,F50
Tell that to the judge ,F50
Sign me up please  happy 2017 and good luck everyone ,F50
Sounds like an interesting case then  I guess enjoy the change from the old tweaker roommate at least  though certainly take care of yourself around this new one and don't get sucked into all her shit ,F50
No worries we're in this together  good luck man  ,F50
exercise helps more than most people know   it releases the same chemicals in the brain that booze does   shit  i need to exercise more,F50
Great job  I too avoided drinking again today  Day 23 tomorrow   Keep it up ,F50
Awesome  Sleep well  See you tomorrow   ,F50
Okay  well    I had an uncle that's much more intelligent than you are  He was dependent upon opiates for 15 20 years of his life due to medical conditions  he was dead by 55 and had ODed like 5 times prior to that ,F50
I'm with you  I've been sick as hell  cant sleep or keep any food down  Hopefully I'll be ok in a few days so I can get back into running  ,F50
That was what I was saying  how can it all be back to square one  Didn't want to argue more,F50
I read it  and I think you're a faggot  ,F50
Thanks for the thoughtful post  man  I think you're very much on the right track,F50
sorry I am out  talked myself into thinking no fap meant porn viewing ok  not really will be back next month  ,F50
I'm finding the same  It's almost a relief to not be drinking   I didn't realise how much of my time was taken up by thinking about it never mind drinking it   Glad to be here and glad you are here too   ,F50
I would disperse mine in bins around town  ,F50
sorry out be back next month,F50
Just crushed a perrier  Craving begone ,F50
I was a fan of the republic while it lasted   We've moved into the post truth era now where everyone gets their own facts   Stupid USA   Just pissed it all away ,F50
Yeah im 2 weeks in and im coughing up nasty shit  Now I know I can't go back because I don't wanna go through all of this again  Plus even coughing all this stuff up I still feel amazing  ,F50
Haha  I was thinking the same myself  I hoe through the stuff ,F50
Are you a pussy  faggot  or a pussy faggot        or both    Also  go fuck yourself and drink moar ,F50
I appreciate the support  Unfortunately  I'm a drunk  And  I can't drink more  because drinking more is what I do  It's a non sequitur  I could OD on pills though  D,F50
Just lie down  You will rethink your bullshit later on  mate   ,F50
My heart goes out to you and your family HP   I have no doubt that your grandfather would be proud to see you reaching out to inspire us in your time of grieving   Thank you for this gift ,F50
You'd be right  I hadn't already taken it  ,F50
Heyyyyyy Buddy   Nice to see you Cunt Punch  ,F50
To pickle  or not to pickle ,F50
I think  The Donald is leaking  MODS   ,F50
Worst feeling ever  having a dream you look at porn  going at it in dream  then waking up and binge relapsing,F50
Duuuuude  just the best show  I realized that October is long and it doesn't mean that we saw the same show  hahaha ,F50
It's true  there are a lot of things I'd be sacrifing if I drank again  better health  peace of mind  self respect  money  time  etc    ,F50
Also  i totally didn't mean to disparage the moderation here or the sub in general  I was just concerned people recovering and trying to avoid drugs might fail to notice it links to a sales site  so I was a bit over dramatic  ,F50
I  just don't understand why you would fuck with Fentanyl  You don't have to  ,F50
Well  then  go see the docs  Quicker than you know it   Show some self preservation  ya fuck  ,F50
You're about as funny as Donald Trump  ,F50
I have read it  about 6 months ago  It was good  though I did read it rather quickly and have since forgotten most of it  Perhaps a reread is in order   ,F50
Drive is a dope word  ,F50
You sound like my mother  Congratz  ,F50
sign me up  check in,F50
"Looks like it's just the first article about the hunger scale  When you click the image or ""read more "" you get sent to a ""website coming soon"" page  ",F50
Yeah  thanks again  hope my call to action didn't call everyone to flood the moderation queue ,F50
It will be tough but you can do it   I will not drink with you ,F50
Your mum has a lower pitch  Fuck off now ,F50
Congrats and looking forward to it   Wow,F50
Thank you   ,F50
naybe it's a blessing in diguise  If you don't take your dose for 3 days in a row  You have to start back at 30mg     Wednesday when the doctor is in  I'm going to begin to taper ,F50
Congrats  You make no sense  Go back to Autism  it actually accepts you  ,F50
Yes  but that's in combination with other things  Pale stool  itching  white nails  URQ discomfort  etc  I feel as if my liver is shit  but I've yet to experience the more serious symptoms  ,F50
Don't keep track at all and there's nothing to reset  If  you're enjoying the time you abstain from porn then just enjoy it  ,F50
Do this in a public library or coffee shop and don't MO that day  It's not a relapse  Otherwise you did relapse ,F50
that's awesome  i was on the edge of my seat reading that  had i been in your shoes  i imagine it would end with me crying in a heap on the floor  I am impressed and inspired  thanks for posting ,F50
Thanks for sharing that  I was trying to find excuses to start again  after only 2 days   but your story had renewed my resolve ,F50
Lethargy eventually goes away  Try to do some excercise  it will also help you sleep  ,F50
Yep  When I visited family  I would carry the empty wine bottles in my suitcase and dump them in the garbage can of the ladies' room at the train station  Pretty classy ,F50
This is such a great quote  Really resonated with me  ,F50
Once a month ish  ,F50
You would want to speak with a doctor about how to safely use antabuse  ,F50
Yes  exactly  The progress doesn't gets lost  we continue from there   Just like in a game  if we die  we continue from a point instead of starting it all over ,F50
"Great job  Just don't fall for that ""I'm free and in control now so one puff won't hurt"" That one puff is the difference between free forever and right back into smokeville",F50
You can do it  Drink plenty of water  eat a bunch of carbs to give your body sugar  that's a large part of the cravings as I understand it  And go do something physical  give your body some endorphins  ,F50
This made me teary eyed  thank you for posting this   ,F50
Welcome  I am so glad you are here  I will not drink with you today   ,F50
"""Look  I thought I was drinking too much  I've decided to give it a rest for a while ""   Thanks  I think that is a good idea to let them know I am serious about it ",F50
I genuinly enjoyed reading that entire paragraph  Thank you for sharing  ,F50
Thanks  This community is really amazing and i'm so glad i found it  ,F50
Thanks for posting this  I needed it tonight  ,F50

Thanks Jay  Happy new year ,F50
Me too  Fingers crossed   ,F50
Thanks for reminding about that  It's really powerful  I wanted to write something about that to envision   but was procrastinating ,F50
You would make a great coach  I guess  that's exactly what the OP needs to do ,F50
Thanks man  Good luck to you too  We can do this ,F50
"Good God    Why haven't you just taken a ""little extra"" Fentanyl then  What are you fighting for  I'm completely serious  because I'm not fighting for anything     it's a genuine question  ",F50
3rd of Jan   3rd day  All good ,F50
I will not drink today ,F50
Stahp  I can only get so hard    ,F50
And you're about as smart    Trolliolololol,F50
I've been blacked out behind the wheel before  Very scary and filled with shame the next day  Avoiding car accidents or worse is a huge motivation for me  Congrats on 15 days  I will not drink with you today  ,F50
I abandoned mindlessly browsing around  So yes  As soon as I finish the exams I will also delete my Facebook account,F50
"""hastag muh kagguh""  Hahahaha  I love this ",F50
For those of you just starting out  and for those of you who just discovered SD  This place is so full of support and resources  The stories I read here are healing  The wisdom I find here helps me stay sober  Welcome ,F50
This was excellent   Congratulations ,F50
Look up freeletics  not easy but the coach really helps  They have one simple rule  finish what you start regardless of how long it takes  ,F50
Toothpicks  Like the cinnamon flavored ones  They helped me when I was sitting in traffic feeling ragey and nix fitting  ,F50
Welcome back  So glad to have you  ,F50
With  Librium I just take that shit as needed  I guess it's really just there to help prevent seizures more than anything   But apparently the dose to prevent a seizure and the dose to combat the fear are very different doses haha  ,F50
Good for you  Day 8 seems a long way away the more I read about everyone's achievements the stronger I feel ,F50
Yup  its not about ladder  its about indicating our good days and our bad  One should always remember their good time too and this will help in that  Thanks for the support ,F50
I absolutely love this comment ,F50
All the comments here are great  I have been slamming tea for the last two months  Sometimes the act of drinking anything  other than alcohol  is what I need  ,F50
So glad to have you  I will not drink with you today  ,F50
This is exactly how i felt a couple weeks in   for us long term smokers maybe it just takes a little longer one can hope   There has to be a light at the end of tunnel my friend,F50
Congrats  that's amazing ,F50
We try not to give direct advice on SD  We encourage people to speak from their own experience and share what worked for them  Did these things help you early on as well  ,F50
Have you tried taking your mom or dad to a meeting  Or taking some AlAnon literature to them    ,F50
Deleting your stash is certainly a great  step  I remember feeling anxious thinking about it  but a lot better 5 minutes after I deleted it  Weird how deleting a couple of pixels can cause anxiety    Hope you're doing well    ,F50
Why is this not top response   It may be wrong  but it seems more legit than the other two tops ,F50
You have to tell him  If he's been through recovery then he's in a great place to help you  ,F50
I love it when I woke up ,F50
He did  He also called me an idiot because I said he couldn't call people idiots for not doing Kraton   sp   And that he couldn't link to selling stuff  Such is life,F50
Wonderful  So glad to see you are having fun with sobriety     This is the way to really live life  Thanks for sharing   ,F50
Good luck on your first day ,F50
Yay  So proud of you   ,F50
It happens  now you want to succeed even more so it's a win too,F50
I don't even have an answer  because I feel this way about somebody who used to be in my life  as well  I'm just here commenting in solidarity ,F50
I have 11 days right now and yes they have helped me personally immensely  This was the first New Years Eve in 25 years that I didn't have a drop ,F50
I have been worrying about not drinking at my wedding     Then I remember I probably won't have one being a drunk   ,F50
No way would I be be able to lunch in a pub and have an open bottle of wine around right now  Those seem like a lot of triggers to be surrounded by  ,F50
Thanks for writing all this out  Very helpful stuff ,F50
Your brain is rewriting man  you will adjust in time  Stick with it  and best of luck ,F50
"Well done  I've ""lost"" many hours here reading  but every single one of those has been sober  SD is such a valuable tool ",F50
I had to look up what DBT was    Sounds interesting   I'd try it   I've been reading a lot of sobriety brain books and I like what they say  I'd give it a shot   ,F50
If you want to quit drinking you should try r stopdrinking,F50
You are a professional ,F50
I went to my first meeting tonight  I also want to try not drinking for a year  Thanks for sharing  ,F50
Can I make a recommendation  Yoga  at least one class with a number of hip centric poses  We hold a lot of emotion in our hips  I've found myself working through a lot of grief in the middle of a pigeon pose ,F50
Thank you very much  I am in early stage of new found sobriety  read your post twice  and found it to be helpful and insightful  I even saved a few passages in my journal  Congrats on your 1 year ,F50
Thanks  I'll try and stick to it  ,F50
Shit comments like this is a total cancer  If someone is coming  here for advice or otherwise  you should treat them seriously  and give them respectable advice ,F50
Hey man I relapsed yesterday  We can do this though  create a lifestyle that doesn't allow stim use  Find more reasons not to use then excuses to get high ,F50
Thank you for the smile   And congratulations on your sobriety   ,F50
Welcome back    ,F50
Don't buy zzzquil  it's just overpriced benadryl and alcohol  Buy generic Benadryl for allergies to get the same medicine at a fraction of the cost  ,F50
Welcome  This is going to be an important and monumental change for you   in a very positive way  We are here to support you ,F50
Good luck  I know you'll smash it   Let us know how it goes ,F50
In interested in how you do with melatonin  Been thinkin about it for years  ,F50
You are welcome here  SD has been one of the most helpful means of support during my recovery  I've found myself sitting in a bar and battling addiction with this subreddit open on my phone looking for a place to say anything about what I'm feeling ,F50
Seriously impressive self mastery  on 11 days no less  huge pat on the back  ,F50
You've nailed what has been happening to me  and my body  I am on day one but hadn't considered my symptoms were pancreatitis  That's actually scary and motivating  Thank you ,F50
Good Luck  Hope you have a great day  xx,F50
I did the exact same thing 6 months ago on my 2 year anniversary   Couldn't figure it out  The angst passed as I'm sure yours will  Congratulations on 5 years  Keep moving forward ,F50
Good job  Keep hanging out with friends  but hang out with the sober ones  If you don't have one  hang out with family  ,F50
So sorry about your grandfather  and thank you for posting   it's important to hear that difficult times can  should  be managed without reverting to old ways   Take care  we're thinking of you x,F50

This is our house favorite too  ,F50
Go Billy     Doing all the things  yay   Well done  and please keep posting your progress  it helps me as well as you ,F50
Its a vocation  not merely a full time job ,F50
You could start off with a DBT skills workbook  I haven't used any but there are a ton on Amazon  ,F50
Wanna be done quick  Cold turkey  The faster you are done with all of this  ,F50
I've gone to the ER for drinking mouthwash  It sucks  Pretty embarrassing  ,F50
which show is OA   good luck ,F50
I'm in a similar boat started at 14 I'm 33 now with a few small breaks which would lead back into casual smoking then back to wake and bake perma stoned  I'm on day 2 of quitting  Stay strong ,F50
I find he daily check in helps too    Fridays are really bad for me too  this week I am going to go for a drive at 5pm to keep myself busy and distracted  ,F50
what's making you feel odd   is there a triggering event  is it the big anniversary  ,F50
I'm pulling for you  You can do it   ,F50
Sign me up      I am done with this ,F50

Hey  It's so hard but you really can do it  I swear to god you can do it  Please be brave  Judy tough it out and soon it won't be so hard anymore  You've got this  ,F50
I found a lot of people who understood what I was going through at group meetings and I helped myself in different ways by going to therapy  Have you considered either of those ,F50
Absolutely  that's incredible  You should be proud of yourself  keep it going  ,F50
Good morning  2 days out of 31 were successfully completed  i am really happy and proud of my self   goodluck everyone     ,F50
You can do it   Stick with it ,F50
Your progress is impressive  congrats  I deleted Facebook but mindless browsing can still be a problem    ,F50
Yeah I'm moved in with 2 really good friends and held my job for 7 months so I'm doing a lot better and sleeping inside more  ,F50
    thx,F50
If it's not a state mandated test  applies to US only  then they cannot legally watch him take it  so either get expensive fake urine or somebody's piss that you know is clean ,F50
Dont let it get you down  man  I recently got back on after a tragedy  and im trying not to beat myself up too much  ,F50
So it's the 3rd January and it maybe because it's the first day back at work but I feel this horrible sense of doom and misery     Hoping this will go soon  ,F50
1 day clean now ,F50
Great post   Keep on enjoying life    ,F50
I needed this  Thank you  ,F50
the first week is pretty crazy I almost wonder if it's a lottery at that point  I wasn't sure any day if I'd give in  so much so that I didn't tell anyone  most people still don't know    keep at it ,F50
omg seriously   I never imagined some of those super talented and coordinated people on the slopes are drinking  you mean everyone is even better than they seem ,F50
For some reason I can never drink mix drinks  I just prefer drinking my liquor straight to get it over with  I sometimes like making Grog but that's when I'm already pretty drunk  ,F50
I had some seizures during puberty  totally sober seizures  just like WD seizures from what I've read   like  flailing around  making weird noises etc    still have no idea what that was about   ,F50
same here  we can do it  x,F50
Haha what is it with shard and jacking off   You're right  its a mugs game  and it leaves you feeling like a shell   Good luck  man ,F50
Good job buddy  I am in similar situation and quit just a few days before you  Made it through the holidays without a drop of alcohol  which would have been unfathomable just a few months ago  Let's keep it going ,F50
Oh the bag is getting a pounding  Today has been better  shitty sleep but no rage   Yet   ,F50
I'm glad mate  Keep the good fight  I'm still clean  2 hours away from 3 days  Positive mindset  We're all here to support each other  Glad it helped ,F50
Yeah  I only hear voices when I've been smoking or going way overboard on stimulants  I had them for a little while before I started using drugs but they stopped as the years went on and I reduced my stress levels  ,F50
I suppose it's easier   But still each day   it's important  for me  to recommit myself ,F50
Congratulations  Keep it on  one day at a time  Best of life to you ,F50
Take all that money you spent on booze  save it up and buy some gear ,F50
welcome   One day at a time ,F50
Look into getting back on Medi cal  There may be a wait  but you'll certainly find help  Best of luck to you  ,F50
You poor soul  I feel your pain  I hope soon enough you will see that alcohol is not your friend  Hope you will join me in not drinking tomorrow  Wishing you the best  ,F50
Given our general lack of everything  wouldn't that much distilled water just suck the last few electrolytes out and kill us  ,F50
Good job  Stay strong   ,F50
"Use this as an example of ""passing a test""   You beat it   Now  you know you can beat it every time   Make a daily commitment to stay free   You've got this ",F50
There's more  better fish in the sea  take this time to find yourself  ,F50
Yeah  turns out I can't die  I guess  Must be magic ,F50
36 hours here  Make sure to drink a lot of fluids  get some rest  and avoid stress as best you can,F50
Like Nike says  Just do it   ,F50
Stop now   I find it helpful  read  necessary  for me to view each day as the first day of the future and commit myself to 'not today'   Perhaps that may be useful to you   Stay strong ,F50
whoa so long   well I guess we all sometimes dream we're still in school doing homework       ,F50
What mikspiro said   Way to go ,F50
good post  stay strong ,F50

I do not understand anything in this life,F50
One day at a time   You've got this ,F50

Congratulations on 40  Fellow 44 y o here   you're not alone    ,F50
In fact  porn addiction  as well as eating disorders are the most difficult compulsions addictions to overcome  because food and being horny are common biological needs  and everyone has to deal with them   ,F50
Who is smearing shit and piss all over your house ,F50
I gotta go with Ed O'Neil's monologue about the dangers of bro love ,F50
Much love   ,F50
Pramipexole seems to work for normal RLS  not sure if WD induced is also dopamine related  Otherwise  gabapentin helps  ,F50
hey  you can do this  i believe in you  and you're not alone     happy new year ,F50
What's your advice about porn addiction   Do you have any  are are you just here to be a shit  Please  enlighten us ,F50
Fantastic job  Thanks for sharing   ,F50
This is exactly what I needed to read this morning  I'm day three and feeling a little bit    on edge and nauseous  Congrats on day four  I'll be skipping my wine purchases and not drinking with you today ,F50
As a person that doesn't remember any of their dreams  I'm really hoping that if my dreams resurface in sobriety I get a few enjoyable ones before being thrown this kind of curveball  Either way  it's better kept in my dreams than in my reality ,F50
Yep   I never used it at all for my drinking   But it has been a godsend in other ways   when there was no other choice of course ,F50
Checking in  good luck all,F50

3 years tomorrow   4th Jan   Haven't been active in this sub since I first stopped drinking back in 2014  but it warms my heart to see the community still supportive as ever   Wish you all the best of luck for the future ,F50
I'm right here with you on day three and feeling the same  Not terrible  but really not great  A lot like  tobacco withdrawal  same fluttery chest and anxiousness  It's kind of a surprise to me   I'm not drinking today though ,F50
Thanks and good morning    Yeah I'm definitely looking forward to feeling better tomorrow  today  than I did through much of 2016     ,F50
That's great  I feel so much younger now   and I'm back to the weight I was in high school     Hopefully I'll ditch the Ben and Jerry's froyo now lol    ,F50
Tried  Ecigs before  just made me crave for the real thing  Will definitely try the sunflower seeds and tic tacs  Thanks for the advice ,F50
Thanks your the second person who mentioned that will definitely give it a shot ,F50
Cold turkey and without planning  I used the Smoke Free App and came to this sub after the App recommended it    Also talking to other people in my live who had quit successfully really helped  ,F50
Hold on brother  I think you survived the hardest part from this adventure or how ya all want to call it  ,F50
Oh the irony  ,F50
This was an amazing read  Thank you so much for sharing  ,F50
You really just said timbf isn't a great guy  Who the fuck are you ,F50
That's great news  Onwards and upwards ,F50
You did nothing wrong   You did nothing wrong at all   I wish I had something to say that would help you but just know you are not to blame ,F50
Interesting  I didn't even know there was a liquid version  I wonder what else is in there  ,F50

I wish I was normal at 7 days  It always takes me at least a month  usually 3 ,F50

Yes    Liquor store is not a stop for me anymore   Feels like Im gaining time at night  Cheking in w  Not drinking w u today   ,F50
"As the old saying goes  ""There's nothing so bad that alcohol won't make it worse """,F50
I also share this line of thought   Eventually the cost is just too high ,F50
You both have to really want to quit  If she relapses it is going to be hard for you to no fall back in your old behavior too ,F50
Moderation is not possible for addicts  you have to abstain totally  So I don't really know what you are trying to say here ,F50
You can do it     We are here for you  ,F50
I will not drink with you today  X,F50
You are not alone ,F50
Checking in   All the best to all of you  may we all beat this ugly addiction ,F50
Ah yes  I'm reassured that it was a good choice whatsoever  It's hard to be sober all the time but it's still better than getting drunk on occasion ,F50
I like you approach to failure   ,F50
Sorry  don't know what happened to my comment  But yeh  aplogies if what I said was misleading  I mean that I rarely had days off before this dry spell ,F50

La croix is my favorite  ,F50
Melatonin gave me awful side effects  Itching and night sweats  I'm not saying don't try  but be aware that it's not for everyone    You can try an over the counter antihistamine called Phenagen  sp   as an alternative ,F50
Here we go again A rough second half to a year I thought was going to start and end sober It is what it is  and I am back for a fresh start  I will not drink today,F50
I commented about melatonin lower down  https   www reddit com r leaves comments 5lofkl   dbxu68b,F50
When I get down about the way I am living my life I realize that it is because God made me for something much greater than completing my daily quest  and as long as that is my primary focus I will be unhappy ,F50
I think the sooner you stop completely  the better  There's no escaping the withdrawals so just get it over with as quickly as possible and let your body heal  Good luck ,F50
I will not drink today ,F50

 I  understand what you're saying  and what Epictetus means  Too much of anything good eventually leaves you  jaded   you start taking more and more of it to get the same buzz  and eventually  no amount  will satisfy you ,F50

i am tempted to get a soda stream since i drink so much carbonated water now  i usually drink it in the evenings  when i used to drink alcohol  so i don't think i would use the mio drops since they have caffeine ,F50
I say quit for any reason that motivates you  If it's a random flip of the calendar that prompts you to quit then so be it  Any reason to get healthy and clean is a good reason  ,F50

Every day you remained sober you succeeded  Your relapse does not mean you failed and does not invalidate your sober days  Forgive yourself  stay sober and strong   You can do this ,F50
Thanks  and congrats on reaching over 150  First few days are always the hardest  I've been changing my habits slowly and hopefully they become permanent the more I progress ,F50

I'll join you all in not drinking today  It's a poison and I don't want it in my body making me incapable of handling life ,F50
I could not get clean after Suboxone until I went to jail    Something in our brains just doesn't click    I wish you God's speed  ,F50

Fuck the other sub  you are here now  Already in 2017   ,X71
What is 14 months  it's going to get better  If you cant get rid of your thought  keep them  Promise me though you will stay alive for a bit longer than February ,X71
Hey  I'm here  My name's Abby ,X71
Taking solance in food is a bad idea anyways  I think there is a pretty much of a chance to star things over  now it's a good time  Are there tihngs that could impede you form doing so ,X71
In a weird way it makes me feel better  people here can understand what I'm feeling  I might have gone through with it by now otherwise ,X71
Why are you in pain ,X71
Do such episodes last for long usually ,X71
That's very good that you are scare so you will not do anything that couldn't be undone  Just a few days and you will be back to normal again ,X71
How about a conversation with somebody and maybe there will be no need for spending any money casue there will be no reason ,X71
If you were from australia you would be old enough to live by yourself  get a job and start saving  2017 will be your year to free yourself from the bullshit ,X71
WE are only human beings  we are vulnerable and sometimes we thing we are stupid  We are meant to be that way  no need to beat you up becasue of that ,X71
Could we keep this convo here ,X71
Go sleep  you could use it for sure  tomorrow you are going to wake up and i'm sure you will feel better,X71
I'm curious  Which country do you live in and what is making it fall apart  ,X71
There earth hAs been around for billions of years and i respect your thinking but focusingg on the positives is always the best way up  The world is becoming greener everyday  And global emmisions are going down every year ,X71
"So you will just kill yourself and let that ""sick society"" win   You still have some land to buy one day ",X71
If you have turned off ur phone and deactivated ur social media surely that shows that someone cares about you and hopes you wake up,X71
What is going on  What happened ,X71
Can you elaborate on the things that are making you hate your life ,X71
No  because I had a s o  before I started cutting but then they broke up with me  a few months later I started cutting out of depression ,X71
as they say  one sometimes has to work hard to make their dreams come true ,X71
Still not a  reason to take your life,X71
Plan  you have a plan  Give yourself a chance to realize it ,X71
Okay  What people ,X71
Lots of chronic physical health problems  I take medication daily but I'm now developing intolerances to the medication so I can no longer control the pain  I'm also sick of my tinnitus  It's been getting louder for a while now and I can't cope with it ,X71
I feel so sorry for you  I myself have chronic back pain  and it's killing me  And you still have that tinnitus on top of everything  What do the doctors say ,X71
Hey  come back here,X71
Would you like to message me  I can't say I know what you've been through  but I'd like to learn more about your situation  maybe offer some advice if I feel qualified for it ,X71
You are young  you still have a life ahead of you  Even if you think that now everything sucks balls  it will get better  Send me a message if you need someone to talk to  ,X71
Why do you think there is no room for you ,X71
i feel almost the opposite sometimes    this sub  along with  r depression has made me realize just how many of us are struggling with similar issues and miserable lives  people that don't have depression or suicidal thoughts really can't relate at all,X71
I can't promise anything my pain has exceeded the resources for coping with pain  I cant anymore  its too painful  if you love someone more than you love yourself you'll understand  ,X71
hey man    i won't be online long but just wanted to say hey and happy new year  hope you're doing alright  hang in there,X71
What have you been doing ,X71
It's because I'm a terrible person ,X71
According to whom  What happened   and there is plenty of room for bad people in this world so i bet it's not your case,X71
According to everyone irl  ,X71
you know it's our generation who raised those young people   And there is still plenty of people in this world that are not like that  The world is as sick as it always has been  but now the information travels faster ,X71
Not everyone  not according to me ,X71
it's what we do  HNE from Canada    still got 7 hours to go until midnight here  hope things get better for you,X71
Darling  do you have any disorders  Also  have you taken anything ,X71
Okay  How much ,X71
I dont think mods realize  that people here are the only ones we can talk with    sometimes we just need to say what is on our mind but we cant because we can get banned ,X71
I really don't want to get into that  It's not relevant to this sub  I only mentioned it because it contributes to the depth of my depression ,X71
I am praying and hoping for you  Please don't give up  Little steps at a time  ,X71
"Okay  Can you tell me what you meant by ""ghosts"" ",X71
Okay  Have you ever seen things before that weren't there  or heard things that weren't there ,X71
What a joke  I'm eating a gun tonight  ,X71
Okay  So you know that they aren't real ,X71
Why i posted this I'm not sure  Gonna have one last call with surmaitians and go from their,X71
But do you find it's led to anything different  Like you started because of depression but do you think that maybe it's led to you cutting yourself because of other emotions ,X71
no problem  take care of yourself and try to have a good night   new years  we're all in this together ,X71
Glad to hear you are moving on from self harm  Accepting that you need help is hard and you can be proud of yourself for doing so   Best wishes ,X71
I'm in 2017 already and it indeed seems better  be strong ,X71
I would definitely encourage you being open and honest with her   open communication is key to any relationship   You're so welcome  Any time  friend ,X71
Of course  do you have anything specific you're asking  Or just my personal experiences,X71
This is not the subreddit for providing suicide ideas  sorry  it's forbidden in the rules   You could just fap and make dank memes ,X71
What war  man  Iraq ,X71
I really wish I had somebody who would do that with me  It sounds really hot ,X71
Hey  you can still turn back  Its not too late  We can talk about what's been going on if you would like ,X71
Kind of you to say  but you don't know OP so you can't accurately judge his character  You're probably a good person though ,X71
I think I know what you mean  Do you have an idea why feel like that  whats going on in your life ,X71
I agree with you  I don't know him  so I don't think that he is a bad person  so he can't claim that everybody agrees on the fact that he is a jerk  ,X71
Happy New Year   3  Heres the first Album of 2017 for me  https   www youtube com watch v vHUlvFCqpNM,X71
You could always prove your grandma wrong,X71
I'm not sure I follow   Not a native english speaker  Can you give us an example ,X71
The point is whatever you make it be  Sometimes we get to choose which way to go  other times we don't  But we always have something to say about who we are  You are not alone here  someone listens  ,X71
I'M GONNA R0LL THE DICE 50 50 GOOD BYE OR GOOD MORNING ,X71
Do you have any way of meeting new women  ,X71
What kind of realism ,X71
Hold on a minute here  Talk to me  So you made a mistake  so have I  Tell me more  ,X71
goodbye  I have to drink away the new year ,X71
"In which case realism would be seeing yourself as a low level person  I don't know if there are ""levels"" of people  but please explain ",X71
And I will listen  and try to comfort you as much as I can  ,X71
To talk  Didn't get enough today though,X71
How so  I am more of a drone to mine  ,X71
Okay  How are you feeling ,X71
I don't see how you are responsible for someone else's choices  He made the decision  not you  ,X71
Yes they do  I have another conversation going right now  What's going on   ,X71
I am sorry to hear that  Is there someone who can help you  Someone you can talk to  A trusted teacher if you are in school  a priest  anyone  ,X71
That's not the best thing  Does it rise to the level of calling the authorities  ,X71
Are you able to physically leave  Is there anywhere for you to go to get away from the abuse  ,X71
I'm okay  Why are you feeling like shit ,X71
I'm just depressed  anxious  I've never belonged anywhere  at school  at home  at church  I just hate living all together  I hate being me  and I hate where I'm going in life  I just want to escape ,X71
Is there somewhere you can go to avoid her long enough to let things settle  Another room  the garage  I don't know  ,X71
That sounds good  You are probably a better cook than I am  ,X71
I am glad you will be fine  Don't want anything bad to happen to you ,X71
What's happened with you lately ,X71
We're talking about you  darling ,X71
Why  You seem to be trying to help other people  the world needs people who care  ,X71
I wanna hear about you too though   ,X71
Please don't  Talk to me,X71
Mostly this  People get down around the holidays  Sometimes I can help  ,X71
Okay  Well I'm very worried about you so could we talk about you  darling ,X71
Just nationality and age then ,X71
What's happening  Why something so extreme  I understand about living for other people  its tough to do  ,X71
Explicit discussion of suicide methods isn't allowed here   See the sidebar   So it's good that  u drnoog9 edited his comment ,X71
Do you mind if I send you an email about it  it's really personal and really sad  I don't feel comfortable sharing it here  ,X71
I'm sorry my friends  I wish you the best I'm not scared anymore this time instead of slotting my wrist wrongly I brought a sharper blade and pills  All I request is that you guys continue to smile and spread your love and happiness ,X71

I appreciate the thought  I already had dinner  but it sounded good to me  Sometimes we can do some good here  ,X71
Being alone  My ex left me a year ago today  I knew I'd be spending tonight alone,X71
I have had some crap rain on my parade too  but nothing awesome  Sometimes wanting and having don't go together  Especially if there is something we have to do  over and over again  ,X71
Sometimes it works  and that's what its all about  Sometimes you don't know what happened  ,X71
I know what you mean  I'm on break from school so I've had a lot of free time lately  Long is relative so it's hard to say  Almost three years I was with my ex,X71
I've felt this way for years now  I am never in control of anything in my life anymore and I just don't see that changing,X71
I am out of time,X71
School starts in a few weeks  three I think  I start working on Tuesday for the first time since last summer,X71
Hey no you're not  There's still time I promise,X71
Let's talk about it okay  I'm here to listen  I promise you aren't alone,X71
But it does stop it from getting any worse ,X71
Good night and Happy New Year to you too  Enjoy the roast  ,X71
Thanks for taking the time to make such a positive comment  Very nice of you ,X71
It does  but it won't matter to you either way  I would rather try to persuade you to keep trying  Sometimes good stuff shows up after the bad  ,X71
Smarty pants  Just be a tease  go ahead  Raspberry           ,X71
It just is too hard to go on until something good happens like I can't wait while I'm in pain for something that might show up,X71
   Ringing in the new year with an epiphany  Nice  I'm happy to hear you pinned it down like this  and I really hope this insight helps you heal  Happy 2017 ,X71
Can you tell me what's happening  Why are you so perturbed  ,X71
I've PM'd you   ,X71
Next year will be better IF you take some action ,X71
Outside of my family it's pretty hard because all the guys I know think that emotions are for pussies if you're a guy  I'll keep trying ,X71
I should try Vitamin D  I'm only outside in the summer anymore ,X71
So when and how did you stop being skinny ,X71
Everyone deserves nice comments you know  You especially right now  If you want to talk  I'm here,X71
How do you feel about going to the ER ,X71
 I understand that you guys do the best you can  ,X71
I know the feeling so much  Have comfort friend ,X71
People  people refuse to accept who I am  So fuck it,X71
I've been trying to go one at a time then there's a new issue and it all just stacks up  I tried to make a list and work though it but I get so depressed looking at everything  ,X71
I've only been cutting for about 2 weeks  but I've also cut more out of anger and anxiety as well ,X71
Yeah I know  I just get down  Sorry about your tooth  How'd you break it ,X71
You are loved   You aren't alone   You are entitled to feel however you want to feel   Remember your son and know that you are his world and let him be yours ,X71
I know  but I'm okay with letting him go  That's why I told him to forget about me  The pain sunk in later  I'm unfortunately fasting in case I decide to take medicine  Thank you for the suggestion though ,X71
You can't but whatever  Death just sounds kinda lit ,X71
If its not too late ,X71
I forgot to mention    he said I don't know why I bother sometimes  I said yeah me too    Maybe that was a sign ,X71
Wow you're a grade A Asshole,X71
I'm just a person man  Can you be specific  Apparently I'm the weirdest person in the fucking world according to how people treat me ,X71
Maybe  but if I compulsively  urge is quite strong  do something stupid before   Then its over ,X71
I honestly can't imagine anything improving ,X71
Hey  thanks  I've given myself till the end of January  Then I don't know ,X71
You don't care about us  You just want upvotes  Some dumbass redditor isn't going to make people not wanna die ,X71
Thank you for your optimism,X71
2 more years man  stick through it  get good grades  go to college  move there  and never look back  Your life will only get better  I promise  ,X71
I can't  I burst into tears  ,X71
Hey there   Clearly you did not come here to be harassed   How are you doing   ,X71
Hey so what's happening with you   Do you want to vent or chat ,X71
9 months  That's a heck of a long time  That's super impressive  and it takes a lot of courage and strength to make it that far   Can I ask whats upsetting you tonight  I'd love to listen to what you have to say ,X71
Hey  You still there  There's a lot on your plate  maybe we chat,X71
Not dumb  it's the emergency room ,X71
Wanna talk about anything  I'm always here if you need to get something off your chest ,X71
Hey  I'm trans too  Maybe we could talk about what's going on  I'd love to hear what you have to say ,X71
Sorry to hear that you're going through this   It's a bad time of year for a breakup  on top of everything else   Could you tell us a bit more about yourself  the relationship  and how it ended   ,X71
Sure  if you want  Thanks  man  i gotta ton of shit going on  i appreciate it ,X71
I'm pretty sure they only call police if you're actively threatening to kill yourself  which is understandable  The operator requested that I put the pills in a different room and that's what I did ,X71
I feel like the closer a person is to you the harder it is to initially tell them about it  You can just open up to them and they help you sort out your situation  ,X71
Really nice of you to share your music  Happy new year ,X71
They could help you  You seem very set on seeking help  and doctors can help you feel better ,X71
Thank you for responding to me  Can I ask what's been bothering you to give you these feelings ,X71
No you don't sound entitled  Put me in a room with 100 women and same thing would happen to me,X71
I have had issues with my mess myself  I know the feeling  Think about all that you will miss  I know it sounds stupid but one of the things that kept me going is all the food I still haven't tried yet ,X71
What's wrong  darling ,X71
What's going on   ,X71
Please tell me more  I want to listen ,X71
I feel you  At least you had some good times once  No one can say for sure if that's possible again  Life is scary and unpredictable and may get better but doesn't always ,X71
I know these words that I'm about to say probably mean nothing  but  I hope you get through this ,X71
I don't even want to die  Just hate living this way  Not sure how much worse 2017 might get ,X71
When you have no job or money people treat you like you're nothing  ,X71

Okay  that's good  Is there anybody who can take you  or can you take yourself ,X71
This type of post is against the rules for many reasons including this one   We do remove them as soon as we find them  so please report them  rather than replying  ,X71
Perhaps  Have you talked to anyone about the feelings you've been having ,X71
No  I just don't seem to trust people irl because what if they ship me to some asylum or something ,X71
Depression is pretty common so I think you're safe regarding the asylum part    Is there anything you wanna talk about ,X71
Usually I drink some water  get some fresh air and reach out to someone so I'm not alone with my thoughts while I sober up   What's on your mind tonight if you'd like to talk about it ,X71
Talk to me if you are hurt,X71
Hey  thank you for the message  I'll listen to it once i get home and let you know ,X71
Thanks for the answer   More guilt that friends and family deserve better ,X71
Hope 2017 is a good one for you   3,X71
Have you ever felt suicidal before ,X71
congrats  man    Of course you should be glad  Be proud   You struggled through a tough time and came out on top  Hang in there and let 2017 be the best year of your life     ,X71
Goodbye  I hope you stay but know I'll love you either way  I don't think you have to go but I'm not you  If you're around let me know  If not we'll  I guess you wouldn't be able to ,X71
Please explain  we can help you   ,X71
Exactly      Did you have a good day ,X71
I haven't  I have spoken to several individuals who have been or currently are if that counts for anything ,X71
It's alright  man  Just something my grandfather used to say to me when I got upset  No one will think you're a little bitch and if they do  they're the bitches  Just hang in there man  Enjoy your night ,X71
How do I stop the suicidal thoughts that I have  There is genuinely no hour that passes without me thinking about suicide ,X71
What does    ,X71
I'm not sure  I just don't want to feel persecuted and hate myself just because I was born a certain way,X71
You having a good time    ,X71
Exactly  Friends are much better  If you'd had that New Years kiss it woulda been meaningless anyway  Be happy with your friends and don't get tangled up in what you decided you have to do ,X71
Thanks man  I've tried therapy  It did not really help   EDIT  It didn't help ,X71
Get someone to talk to  Maybe you need a friend circle to vent through ,X71
Well    wouldn't you want to make amends rather than dig the dagger deeper  Honestly  talk to a third party  Hell  it could even be me ,X71
Forward an email letter to gf  then ask her to send it to him without telling that you wrote email letter  ,X71
Ehm    that's unique to me  How do you deal with that ,X71
You're the conductor of train  Don't let anyone slow you down  Just keep moving forward,X71
Do u think it was the therapist  I've heard you might need to try a few before you find the one   ,X71
 You're right  It definitely was not the one  I guess I'll have to keep looking  Thanks ,X71
She's a lesbian woman  with five male personalities  and a female one  And the female is lesbian as well ,X71
My pleasure  Hope I helped some,X71
I am a straight old guy   You have nothing to ne ashamed of in my eyes or in the eyes of my church   However  iI have dear friends who have felt the way you describe feeling ,X71
Maybe it's a pain kink blood kink masochrist sort of thing   Pain itself is pleasurable  and sex is also very pleasurable  so yeah  I see how you can link them together  ,X71
Okay  I see  Sorry  my phrasing may be bad due to my lack of sleep  Let me know how it goes  ,X71
Thanks for listening  And get some sleep    ,X71
Hey buddy  are you alright  Message me if you want to talk about it  ,X71
don't leave man  your stories are beautiful,X71
You are loved  ,X71
You may feel like you have no way out right now  But you do  Love every day for that day  Stay positive  You will be ok  You control your destiny  I will keep you in my thoughts and prayers  ,X71
If I were in your shoes I'd like to believe I'd start making stealthy preparations to detach and start over as soon as possible  ,X71
Nothing is up to chance  You decide your future  Chance your dreams  I have faith  If you fail     you learn     then you try agin  Trust me  crazier shit has happened  ,X71
Also  Don't be a bitch  Don't look to other people  lol inside  You have the drive  Just fucking go for it,X71
Not as bad as you think  Sun is rising I the am  ,X71
"The problem is that I know I""m a crybaby loser  but I don't really want to do anything to change it  And I don't think the US is so 'cool'  I lived there for 7 years  and am well aware of its shortcomings  ",X71
Hey man  you wanna talk here or pm    Quick edit  its 5am here and i gotta sleep  hope to talk later  Stay safe ,X71
Are you finding the idea of fighting your way back out again difficult ,X71
Yes i am  but i opend up a bit to my GP who has been brilliant  i'm on medication  not sleeping is killing me  i'm so tired all the time,X71
My relationship with my parents is horrible  They even told me once it'd be better if I hadn't been born      Each place has its shortcomings   I know that  but India's shortcomings are the ones I have problems with  ,X71
Have you tried programming yet  There's a lot of demand for it  ,X71
I dont have my hopes up but im really happy for you man  Dont give in  we're all in the same damn hole,X71
Sending hugs and love your way  Hope you are doing fine  If you need someone to chat to drop me a PM  I know how hard this time of year is    ,X71
You need to spend just a quick second thinking about what will make you happy  Idc how silly or unattainable you think it it    just think it  Then  tell yourself you deserve it  I hope you feel better today ,X71
Just talking to someone for once is nice  Thanks man ,X71
"Happy New Year  will you be keeping us updated throughout your ""treatment"" ",X71
Remove Facebook from your life so you'll stop comparing yourself to others  Facebook is not reality  People there are fake and post pictures of how happy they are but in reality it's the opposite  Stay away ,X71
Why do you think your existence is unworthy ,X71
"I'm sorry you're at this point and hope that you're able to recover successfully from your ""treatment"" halfway through  if you were to change your mind  ",X71
it's strange how only music can actually make me feel anything anymore  ,X71
Congratulations   I hope I can make another one year clean post next year   ,X71
Taking on a big list of stuff like that is just going to be overwhelming  Everyone's always very hard on themselves but all that stuff you wrote down could be changed if you want it to be changed  ,X71
Here to help in whatever way you need  What's been going on lately  ,X71
Bc everything has gotten worse over these past few months ,X71
Thank you and  u punkrockcrackerjacks for sharing,X71
I hope some ups come  Because suicide is my only other option if I keep going lower ,X71
Congrats  I hope you can stay clean for another year  or even better  forever ,X71
I understand that  Its hard to handle it all  I just hope you can handle each one in its turn and not let all of it weigh you down  ,X71
What if it is simply faith in yourself  Believing that you can get better is going to be a factor in your treatment  That is not a lie  nor is it a guarantee  The determining factor in this is you ,X71
I have pmed you  Please respond x,X71
Yes  not being allowed to be yourself is painful and damaging  Goid to hear your friends give their best to understand you  How much more time until you turn 18  ,X71
Here to help  talk to me ,X71
Why should i think my existence is worthy  ,X71
Thats messed up  Im sorry  I know over here you could report them and get them in some serious trouble for breaking patient confidentiality  I know here if your a danger to yourself or others then they have to report it  How are you today ,X71
yeah I used to weigh 119 and 6ft and got up to 160 at one point  though stopped and started off and on and was about 150 in November   haven't weighed myself since I'd rather not know   probably 140 though,X71
Hey  what's up ,X71
Oh man I still have this problem  I'm just not gonna look for pics of her but if I accidentally do  it just gets terrible  I'm happy for you though    ,X71
I'm not sure  1 5   2 weeks total ,X71
its good to know that not all humans are assholes,X71
You'd be missing out on a lot of good,X71
Honestly I could be better  I have a math final in four days that I have to start studying for and I'm exhausted from Kat night,X71
what do you for fun ,X71
Sigh I just can't shake the thought my plan is already going forward on the 9th of January I will commit suicide I'm sorry you wasted your time talking to me but know this when everyone else ignored me you were there so I thank you for that ,X71
They in no way compare in intensity to all the bad ,X71
Such as     When one is dead they're not there  They aren't missing anything  They've finished existing  Things that don't exist don't feel one way or another about reality ,X71
But potential exists  and in death you'd be leaving much of it unrealised,X71
It's always going to be painful  Least painful would be not doing it,X71
I'd be betting on the small chance of something changing   If I have no will left to make a difference  the odds of winning this gamble are very small ,X71
I know these words probably mean nothing to you  but I wish you peace my friend,X71
There's a reason we put pets down to end their suffering ,X71
i dont know if i want to continue this year  i gave a chance for the '16 but and even with things going to better i just want to end it all  i feel like iam living a lie  dont know what to do   ,X71
We put down pet's because we can't help them or can't afford to  People are different,X71
Some people are beyond help ,X71
That's quite soon  May I ask why you want to end it tonight ,X71
This is why I don't ask for advice from those who aren't depressed    You dont understand what it's like when no matter what you try to taste  it all tastes like stale bread  And you're sick of stale bread ,X71
This is awesome   New year and a new outlook  keep it up     ,X71
Tell your boyfriend how you feel  I'm sure he will try to help you feel better  ,X71
That's where you're wrong  but whatever  ,X71
Right  you were ready to end it but they reminded you that there's books in the world cause you've clearly forgotten and somehow you know how to feel again ,X71
I hate my life  I lost the love of my life and i'm so lonely and sad all the time  I refuse to take my anti depressants and I feel as if i'm a burden to everyone on this Earth,X71
Do not let anyone make you feel worthless  I deleted all social media not to see that narcissist asshole  The pain I felt last year was unimaginable  but I know this will soon pass   Thank you for sharing  Wishing you all the best,X71
Yes  you are the only one who feels sad and there are no redeeming qualities to humankind  ,X71
I'm awful with computers  I know nothing about that kind of stuff  ,X71
That wasn't implied at all   What was implied is that I'm absolutely aware of all those things you listed cause I experience them regularly and it makes no difference   Assuming that reminding me of them will somehow change everything is just downplaying the issue ,X71
Thanks  You too ,X71
It really is terrible  The pain of heartbreak is seriously worse than any physical pain I've felt  ,X71
It's so hard not to think about her  Just hoping it doesn't last forever  It would be easy to forget about her if she was a bitch or something  but she was perfect  And still is  ,X71
Thank you  you are very kind and you did make me feel better  I'm going to keep trying I just don't know how much more of trying and failing I can take ,X71
It's always painful unless you have no reason to live ,X71
how about kindness  charity and love instead ,X71
You won't be alone unless you take the initiative and start talking to others ,X71
2017 is my year to be a selfish asshole  Time to get started  ,X71
Yeah when things end badly  it's so hard to try and put our minds at ease  No matter what the other person did wrong I will always blame myself  ,X71
Damn if this isn't the most logical response I've read on here   thank you for understanding  ,X71
Thank you all   I had a rough new years eve but i woke up   I'm here somehow  I feel like absolute shit but its because i survived   ,X71
I can't since I'm under 18 ,X71
Pretty sure you could do that here too  The Netherlands are pretty great  Today is a good day actually  Some headaches but apart from that  I'm fine  How about you  ,X71
I used lament wrong   and that adds to my stupidity and furthers my reasoning for leaving this place  FML,X71
What does  Did somebody hurt you  or did you hurt yourself  darling  Are you someplace safe ,X71
I'm glad you managed to get past her  man  And I'm happy things are looking up for you  too  I hope you manage to find someone in 2017  and that it goes well ,X71
He ended up cheating on me and I forgave him but he told me he didn't want to be with me anymore and has been ignoring all my calls and texts  And I feel like everyone im around I just drag them down with me ,X71
Thank you  I'm sorry you had to go through that and i'm sorry about your sister and mother  Family can be really stressful sometimes ,X71
How do you explain the complete lack of happiness outside complete Mania then  That mania happens a few times a year  about week to two each time  I just don't want to exist anymore ,X71
What was happening  darling ,X71
Doing well  Just making some lunch for the family  Glad today is a good day  did you do anything to celebrate the new year  ,X71
Based upon our convo  you fall into the non asshole category as well  You might not see it yet but I'm sure you will one day  ,X71
She was a random person on the internet and I'm on meds and seeing a therpist but none of its working ,X71
Thank you  it means a lot for someone to share their story with you  Also i'm glad you are doing better    ,X71
 She was a random person on the internet   You really don't have to care about an opinion of a random person on the internet who is mean to you   How old are you  How long have you been suicidal ,X71
Well it sounds like you should record these teachers secretly on your mobile and then send it to your local media outlet  That teacher will be fired pretty quickly  Your school sounds like shit btw  No one deserves to be treated that way  ,X71
then quit being impatient and wait until you're 18 and then take the plunge  get the hell out of where you live ,X71
I'm 18 I've been suicidal for about 6 months ,X71
Self harm is considered any type of method of deliberately injuring yourself  from cutting to scratching to burning to bruising  Self injury I think is an umbrella term and also includes binge eating drinking  so I would think nail biting for pain would count as selfharm ,X71
What does make you suicidal if you don't mind me asking ,X71
Lonlieness and being a kissless virgin ,X71
2017 is going to be a much better year than the last  Glad to hear you aren't feeling suicidal today  Best of luck ,X71
It was inspired by this photo  http   m imgur com gallery RwzLOD0,X71
5 years is a long time to work out  get in shape  read a bunch  and generally improve yourself  Maybe see it as an opportunity  I know it certainly doesn't feel like one  but maybe there can be a silver lining here,X71
I love sci fi  especially the books  Any favourites   Unfortunately I did not get to enjoy the New Year morning as I passed out into a heavy sleep    But at least u cannot do anything to urself when asleep   ,X71
Hey man  please don't take pills  can you chat with me instead ,X71
I'm here   I would try talking you out of it   Nine psychs are a lot   Over what period of time  ,X71
"2 years  They all reject me because I'm at a ""too high risk of suicide""",X71
Wow   Sometimes the issue with mental health professionals  is that it is a job     Must be so frustrating for you   Have you ever actually tried ,X71
yes  I overdosed last night  as well as about 6 months ago  Seems I didn't take enough though    It's the only time I hope for anything  hope for it to succeed ,X71
I've been distracting myself with food  videogames  and self harm but I guess school will be good to start again  Just as something to do ,X71
Well what are some things you like to do  Or maybe things you've always wanted to try  ,X71
Okay  How do you feel about that ,X71
Well I like to watch tv and long car rides  But I problem is I have so much work to do like study for finals and SAT ACT work  And I'm just so sad about my life and unmotivated to do anything  ,X71
I'm 20  There are no moments of hope  except for those when I hope my latest suicide attempt succeeds  Those are the only ones ,X71
There are no painless ways to die,X71
Well the motivation will come and go  Sometimes I'm really excited to get out and do stuff and sometimes I just want to sit at home and watch tv all day  What shows have you been watching  ,X71
There's nothing wrong with being an introvert  ,X71
Things will get better  You can't do this  I'm a huge introvert too  Pm me  ,X71
But I am more introverted than most introverts and maybe I am a bit of a loner  ,X71
I was a loner for years  I couldn't even relate to my family  Just hang in there a little longer  Im glad I did  I met another loner and we became best friends  She saved my life  ,X71
Thanks  I guess I will just ignore people who are mean to me and not believe the things they say to me ,X71
People suck but you will meet good people who are introverts too  Just hang in there  Please  Day by day  Week by week  It's a battle but you'll win  ,X71
Before there was long stretch when I felt not good but recently I had been feeling better  I don't know why I started feeling not good again  I think I should spend less time on reddit and look for better people  Thanks again  ,X71
No  I just slept til 3 pm  ate something and relaxed with the cats,X71
Bad idea  Talk to me instead,X71
Don't ever do pills  sometimes nothing happens and you can die weeks later from organ failure  Sometimes you'll be throwing up for hours and in constant pain  It's very unlikely that overdosing will be a nice way to go ,X71
Haha yeah Reddit will do that to you,X71
No death is painless  at least not the kind you can inflict on yourself  Not to mention any possible emotional troubles that could happen too  You're whole life you have choices  but this is one that you can't change your mind afterwards ,X71
Well I'm in high school but I hope my major will be something good  lol ,X71
Just freshman year  not as stressful as expected tbh ,X71
It is the only was i see out when I'm that low  ,X71
I've tried online  quite a few times  Nobody ever seems to stick around,X71
I just feel really isolated lately and unloved ,X71
Like everything's going really bad nothing makes me happy anymore ,X71
You've got this  I just hope I don't see my ex hahahahaha     then I might be singing a diff tune   did just take time    sometimes I think maybe I really did fuck up the real thing,X71
nobody is there for me  Nobody ever will be,X71
How big are your fucking scars to repel someone like that  Scars on a man usually aren't all that terrible ,X71
Care to elaborate at all ,X71
On a road trip    Went to visit family with a Co worker from the same home town    I'm in the passenger seat right now,X71
Well  did something bad happen when you were with the family  Is it the coworker  Or just general things going in life ,X71
I agree  I know it'll take work ,X71
ok  talk about what ,X71
Do you have telegram or anything  I know it may not be much and not in replacement of IRL contact  But I'll be there for you  online  if you need me ,X71
Never too late to change and do some volunteer work ,X71
I'll try more  thank you so much for the advice  I think I just need to really put myself out there  hopefully this upcoming semester since I don't have any of my friends in my classes ,X71
Anything  Like    what're you doing right now  ,X71
Hey there  I do not know what you've been through  I do not know you  But I'm here to listen if you ever need to talk ,X71
I'm playing euro truck sim and trying to forget that life exists,X71
Do you have a song that you can relate to the most now ,X71
I didn't think I was going to end up to this point  either  What's a genre or band you can feel your experience through the most ,X71
Do you play any other games  That nodream person seemed to care a lot  think they could become a friend ,X71
Are you my brother ,X71
people only pretend to care to feel better about themselves,X71
Let's talk  I've had very similar experiences  In fact  I still have them time to time  but not to the point where I want to commit suicide ,X71
Hit me up if you want to talk a bit ,X71
Been having fights all day and yesterday tired of getting put down I'm actually thinking of just killing myself today   ,X71
Why are the fights happening in the first place  Are you instigating it ,X71
I wish you the best of luck,X71
No my mom and husband are,X71
Hey my anniversary with my ex is November 9th  And I also recently stopped wanting to kill myself over it    Good for you man  Keep well,X71
I'm trying to take care of my pigs but it's not helping usually my guinea pigs distract me but they're just making me more pissed,X71
Do you not have music to listen to  No noise cancelling earbuds  Or  could you not drive to some relaxation spot go for a walk ,X71
Unfortunately no noise cancelling earbuds I wish I had some ,X71
That sucks  Don't you wish you could just walk out of the house for a bit ,X71
I'll try doing that just I've been feeling pretty sick with the flu and just them yelling at me makes my head hurt so bad,X71
It's probably your last resort  Good luck  and let me know if you feel better after  Some fresh air couldn't hurt after feeling so cramped up in that house of yours ,X71
Yeah I've day dreamed about my own  Thought I was the only one  I've imagined about it since I was like 12 or 13 ,X71
Ty just this whole years been like shit ,X71
If you need to talk more  I'll be available ,X71
Depends on how you act on the phone  honestly  Sometimes  they'll just try to talk you out of it  You can always talk to me  though ,X71
You there  man ,X71
So much this    well said ,X71
Take care  Hug sent ,X71
Hey buddy    Whatcha wanna talk about ,X71
Encouraging words and I know I'll be fine  Sometimes I just need to vent  thanks for the help   Life is full of stages  ultimately you can be happy if you really want to and break free from the pity train,X71
 A guy started to talk to me  Was this online or in person  Was he trying to sexually harass you or some sort ,X71
Yes  I often wonder who of the people who haven't bothered with me in years will show up and fake cry for sympathy points ,X71
It really depends on the person on the line and your risk level  If you tell them you are going to do it and say your plan they are pretty likely to call the police  I would tread carefully but they aren't all bad ,X71
I wish you all the best in 2017 and forward ,X71
I can relate  I feel the same ,X71
all the time lately ,X71
Your reasons aren't pathetic  You aren't pathetic  Your feelings aren't less valid than those of anyone else here  ,X71
Went to my first concert  and then a few others after  Finished my first semester of my new degree at school   How about you sj ,X71
Happy you're still here   sorry you feel like shit  Do you mind talking about what happened ,X71
Calves these days mainly to hide it  But on the downside I'll never be able to wear shorts or skirts without thick tights ever again ,X71
From other posts it seems as though she ran away,X71
My old scars on my left and right arms are several scratches on top of each other that have merged into an obvious brown patch  I have plans for my arm over the spring though   ,X71
lets kill m with cuteness   hello,X71
You will never see that  though   What makes you feel peaceful about that ,X71
Wow man that sucks  You should talk to your room mate about what constitutes as actually helping you   ,X71
"It is the same ""advice"" that that user copies and pastes as a response to any question in a wide variety of mental health subs  No clue ",X71
I did this yesterday and I       ,X71
Try looking at this video  it might seem cheesy but it helped me https   www youtube com watch v PCzth7Vz bM,X71
I'm not really comfortable posting picture but as far as how my body scars  some of them become a burgundy colour and some get white pretty quickly  After a while most of them become white ,X71
Hit me up if you need someone to talk to ,X71
Other than colour  what's the important distinction between a red and a white scar  ,X71
I'm looking forward to seeing where things go with someone   And congrats again on the little sproutlet   Cutest nickname btw ,X71
Fire can be relaxing but it can also be dangerous  thanks for sharing and for being safe  ,X71
Something   anything not relating to police   girlfriends   or hospitals  ,X71
I feel weighed down all the time  something like chronic fatigue  I hope that fixing that would help some  I just want to do something great  I want to be smart ,X71
You like music  ,X71
Do you play video games at all  What kind of movies do you like ,X71
Just a week ago you received a compliment  and now this  What happened ,X71
Yeah    All kinds    I used to go to Bonnaroo every year  ,X71
Can I pm you ,X71
No  I don't want one  I wish my corpse just disappear ,X71
I really enjoy video games    I just can't seem to have them be enjoyable anymore    My life hue looks like gears of war    Dull  dull   and gray dull  ,X71
Not recently    What are you listening to atm  anything good    I'm loving Frank Turner recently  ,X71
"I know exactly how you feel  I feel like my only motivation to stop is because it's ""bad"" and  because the scars are a nuisance  I don't dislike them  but the reactions from others  especially family  is hard to deal with  ",X71
That really sucks man  l think they had not a single right to look through YOUR stuff and to throw away YOUR stuff  It's actually none of their business I'd say    ,X71
Totally understand  was just stating that it's hard to know  If the cut you made was superficial  then yes it is likely the new scar will be white across your hypertrophic red scar  ,X71
"Yeah that's what I'm guessing  My main question was just will the hypertrophic scar ""deflate"" a bit due to a scar being across it or will it just be like two  shorter raised scars now ",X71
Nothing against her but don't think she's the right person to be speaking to if you're feeling fragile   Think you need someone who's a bit more balanced in their opinions and perspectives ,X71
Hey lets talk  ,X71
i think it depends on the therapist  i told my therapist i felt suicidal and they didn't do anything  i'm under 18   You shouldn't be afraid to tell him her if you are tho ,X71
I already did attempt though ,X71
Hey  I'm also from NWI  Thanks for your service and I'm sorry to hear you're hurting   What kind of books do you like ,X71
all the best to your 2017 endeavours OP  ,X71
Thanks for this man ,X71
My face looks filthy dirty all the time  GET IT OFF ME GET IT OFF ME   I want to shoot myself  I think I'll go to a gun show and buy a pistol and shoot mysrlf in the head ,X71
Probably two shorter raised scars  ,X71
A bit of rock like five finger death punch   nin  black label society   Since other genres as well    Some r b,X71
Don't worry about it  I'm here if you need me  ,X71
Ahh  I see  I'd read about the different types of scar  but most information I'd seen referenced texture and cause more than colour and such  Thank you  ,X71
She seems like a cunt  Find a girl who's not that petty about physical appearance and or mental health issues ,X71
I enjoy fiction the most    Although I can't focus enough to read anything right now    Some ones id like to reread are House of Leaves  a lot of my Tom Clancy and James Patterson,X71
Always happy to answer questions  I'm new here  so thanks for being so kind    ,X71
What defines adult  23 certainly doesn't feel like one   ,X71
21 M  What can I do you for  Haven't cut in almost four years  I stopped when I was 18  but I still want to all the time ,X71
I do it to think about how many people would actually show their support for me  to show my parents that people actually did care about me and that I did have friends  unlike what they want to think ,X71
Haha  I feel so happy for you  ,X71
God it's been years since I heard FFDP  Do you play  ,X71
Thanks for your help    ,X71
Congrats on being able to drink  and even more on the time lapse  Open to a PM    Edit  I'd love some advice  ,X71
I know that feeling  I'm sorry you suffer with it too  ,X71
Feel free to PM me  I don't bite   much  ,X71

I've been clean for two months  and yes  there are  many  times I miss it   Crave it   Ache for it  I'm not sure if I ever will get over it ,X71
I used to a long time ago   but my hands have been a bit mangled from army  ,X71
Thanks for the recommendation I will definitely look into it    What about memoirs makes it easier to you  ,X71
Why what   Why the downvotes ,X71
Why do you feel this way ,X71
I have to disagree with the Vaseline part  While it can help  you should never put anything in an open wound  This also applies to antibiotic ointment  ,X71
That does sound lie it was weird   I hope you are feeling better,X71
Because I have A LOT of scars on my face  Treatments have failed and my life is ruined ,X71
How come it's ruining your life ,X71
"I banged this out rly quick  so I should prob do an edit  Ik you don't put anything in an ""open"" wound  but most fresh cuts  by fresh I mean within a day  aren't really ""open""  ",X71
22  don't feel like an adult  Feel free to message if you need to ,X71
It is perceived as a weakness and is a deal breaker to many people  I feel discriminated against ,X71
Before you do  just make sure you take enough time on the bridge to decide it's what you really want  Also please for the love of god don't do it drunk  you can't be trusted to do what you really want when that happens  ,X71
Lots of INFPs checking in I see  ,X71
Thank you  I really appreciate it ,X71
The term no one ever understands is kind of a bold statement  and it's never very good to use  Do you want to try explaining it more in detail to me ,X71
Yeah It started about 6 months ago and has been getting worse and worse everyday ,X71
Hey  I'm only here because this is one of the few things that makes me feel like a less shitty person  So thanks for making me feel like a made a difference ,X71
Were you upset before then  or did the depression start at that time too ,X71
You need someone to talk to ,X71
I could never get into gears of war    but i play plenty of games  Mainly doing a mmo right  Seems to help snap me out of my depression since i have something to work for  Do you play any mmos ,X71
Hey  you still there  I don't have Kik or WhatsApp  but if you want to talk here I'll be around for a while  I can't promise to make anything better  but I can be your friend,X71
Not really   I used to play world of warcraft  that's about as close as I get   I guess I could try Diablo 3 again and keep ranking up   maybe the mindless destroying will make me take my mind off of things ,X71
yes please i feel like i have no one  ,X71
I've been dealing with depression since i was about 4 but it was minor ,X71
Hey buddy  I'm sorry you're having a rough time  Would you tell us why you feel like you want to end your life  ,X71
I am still alive ,X71
I decided to play 18 pill cocktail  And apparently I'm a horse because that didn't do it  I used to experiment with drugs but not to that extent  ,X71

Yes  all the time   ,X71
Dont give up man  there's always hope  maybe not today  but eventually  if you make the right choices  someday it will be different  ,X71
Man  sounds like a bad time   Bad situations can be such a hard thing to get through    but you make it sound like there is something more,X71
how old is your daughter   It sounds like you got a lot going on   Here to be supportive     ,X71
nice weather today eh ,X71
It's actually been rainy where i live sadly wbu,X71

What kind of videos are you watching ,X71
Fellow INFP here  When I took the personality test  it explained a lot about me that I had never been able to put into words ,X71
Do you know anything about lemon juice working after the scars have been there a couple of months  or why this works  Thank you for your advice nonetheless  I appreciate it ,X71
Find a better reason to live than the life you have  What really brings you joy  ,X71
Thanks    I got his last letter about a day before I learned of his passing  He was sick but I thought he was going to make it  Just kind of bummed that I wont be getting anymore letters  ,X71
That's what Dr  Kevorkian thought  He helped people kill themselves   Assisted suicide   If someone wanted to die  why let them suffer by being alive  He helped them do what they wanted to do ,X71
oh  honey  how much time do you have  LOL  Of course there's more  one can't get to this point without there being a shitload of stuff that goes with   just happy to hear from someone  I guess I'm not alone ,X71
Esports  CS GO is the way to go FeelsGoodMan,X71
To the guys sending me messages I'm heading to bed right now  but I really would like to speak with you tomorrow ,X71

Car videos on YouTube ,X71

Please don't do that  What's wrong  How can I help ,X71
Great  now you're here   I hope you're fucking happy now ,X71
I'm at a loss for words   This is the most childish thing I have ever seen ,X71
I removed my comment but I'll put it back   Top Fucking Kek ,X71
It's illegal to be discriminated against in the workforce because of your appearance  Are you aware of that ,X71
Hey  are you still here with us ,X71
I don't care about the dubtrack anymore   I don't care about if everyone forgives me   I don't even care if my life suddenly goes better and everything is perfect for me   All I can think about is everything I've already done ,X71
I guess I am childish ,X71
Of course you'd laugh  Nobody would care if I died ,X71
I came to my senses after I was banned and realized how fucking idiotic I am  I've been like this for a long time ,X71
Thank you  I'll try to change ,X71

Tyvm for caring bro  it really makes me feel better   ,X71
Yes  I get envious when I see that other people have cut deeper or more than I have  have more scars or bigger scars  ,X71
communications  when i started school i was interested in journalism but not so much anymore,X71
Why would they be looking through your stuff  Were they worried about you and looking for blades or were they just nosy  Also mention to them that they need to know what actually helps and what doesn't ,X71
  Are you in high school   Yes  In the U S,X71
I always imagine everyone there who was trash to me  The thought of people feeling guilty caring about me after I die makes me feel happy,X71
What the fuck  What job do you work ,X71
I'm sorry you feel this way  too ,X71
I completely  completely understand this feeling   What is it  exactly  that makes you not want to live anymore  Is it your father ,X71
Hey friend    what are you up to now  ,X71
  Which subject or subjects are you ok good succeeding at   I'm only passing shop and geography because they're so damn easy to coast through with minimal effort ,X71
Ok  so that's not a degree that you'll get out of college and find absolutely no jobs in  There's a wide range of stuff you can do with that degree  I think you're on a better path than you give yourself credit for   ,X71
Hold hold up  Is this in the U S  ,X71
Let's talk  I kind of have my faults and weirdness too ,X71
"It's weird  I've read a study on why people with ""higher IQ"" have less friends in comparison to the average  Don't worry dude  I'm kind of in the same boat as you  The only reason I have friends is video games and esports  Haha ",X71
Yes  South Carolina  specifically  ,X71

Hi  Just writing the note shows that you still have a reason to be alive  There are people that care about you in this life  They're your reason to keep fighting and stay alive  ,X71
I recommend looking at  r slavelabour and  r forhire in the meantime  Those two have worked wonders for me at times  I used to write academic essays on  r slavelabour  even though it was against the rules  Hah ,X71
it's not  don't do it  ,X71
personally  i dont think its ever the right thing to do  there is always another way,X71
i'm here to talk if you need to  ,X71
Because you realize there's something else to live for  and that you just haven't found it yet,X71
I hope you wake up tomorrow and find that it's not the day  3,X71

Nah nah nah  Let's talk for a bit  What's up ,X71
Don't do it  Things always get better  Have you tried talking with family or friends ,X71
Would you consider yourself a loner during your school years  What was your school and home environment like ,X71
Therapist  See a therapist ASAP,X71
I'll never be anything special or good  Just one of the people who live and die and suffer their way through it so others can feel better about their own situation,X71
Do you exercise  Go out for fresh walks in the morning  Maybe talk to the elders at the retirement homes or do some volunteer work ,X71
My family is toxic and I have no friends ,X71
"My career for law enforcement is over before it could start  I have no friends  and the one love for me left me December 20th to ""be independent "" and blocked me on everything  Toxic family  Just to name a few ",X71
I mean I Can help you out money wise og with a place to live  Cause I live in Denmark  But I'm here to talk if you ever need it,X71
Well you can make a million friends here on Reddit  This subreddit is meant specifically to help  were all supportive here   How long have you been suicidal  And is there any recent events which made you this way ,X71
I'm surprised  Maybe you just need a therapist or someone to talk to  It just seems like you're going through a bipolar esque phase ,X71
Hit me up if you need someone to talk to  I'll be on for a little longer ,X71
Haha yeah  I've been trying to push myself to see a therapist  but I guess it's hard to take that real first step  Thanks for reaching out to me  though ,X71
I don't want support  I want death  I wish to cease existing  This is number 3 being suicidal  The  One  left me on the 20th  ,X71
Just don't do meth  you will see a change in your life  It's not that life is unfair  you just chose to ruin yours  my friend,X71
I'm dreadfully sorry for leaving  yesterday  Please tell me you're okay ,X71
I had to leave because of some unavoidable circumtances ,X71
6 min til psychologist time  Just waiting  It's always the worst ,X71
Please don't  please just wait a little bit longer for these negative thoughts to go away,X71
Yes   That's the one good thing about New Years  is that it gives a good opportunity for a jumping off point to get help or start moving  ,X71
Sounds like you got a serious case of girl problems my dude  I am the same  I feel sorry but please just find distractions until you find another girl,X71
Recommend watching Louis Rossmann's 2017 video about procrastination  He may be blunt  but it works ,X71
I'm heading to bed right now  but I'll be sure to watch that while I'm procrastinating something tomorrow  haha   Thanks again for talking with me ,X71
You're probs gonna regret Not getting any sleep  my friend,X71
I know I'll regret it but I can't force myself to sleep  I have insomnia even when I'm not stressed out ,X71
Well then you don't really have a choice  I guess  So What are you up to at 3AM   Btw  if you want the conversation another place  just tell me,X71
Message me your info  Would help me out a lot  ,X71
So true  I mean one thing is getting people in your life  but when you gotta find friends  It's gotta be someone you click with and that makes it 10 times more difficult ,X71
Wanna talk sometime  Sorry for the late reply  Don't worry though  I'll be there for ya ,X71
Thank you and please message me  ,X71
You need to talk to a therapist who will help you process and come to terms with what happened  You should NEVER blame yourself for something like this ,X71
Technically it might have been your fault  partly   But it was Also other People's fault  But Then again  you didn't put the rope around his neck  you just didn't remove it either ,X71
Do you ever feel so sad your teeth hurt ,X71
I feel like maybe if I died my friends would be happy  They hate me  ,X71
It is funny when I bleed and bleed  It is funny  ,X71
I know I'm stupid  I know I'm an idiot but will you be my friend ,X71
I will be your friend for now if it helps  ,X71
If It's meant to be  It's gonna happen I guess,X71
There isn't a way for them to track you  i asked this question when I called  This was the main one  national suicide prevention   But that's not to say they don't have a basic caller ID and can forward that to the authorities  ,X71
Why do you hate me,X71
"You make a very interesting point  when you refer to the ""economics"" of suicide and why society frowns upon it  Makes a lot of sense  Especially in this modern age when people are reduced to consumers  At least in this culture  America   ",X71
Im sorry for all you have endured to male u feel this way  I can only hope u feel the sun once more in the morning and many mornings to come ,X71
If you've no one to think well of you  only disappointment and defat what does one have for motivation  ,X71
I'm going to be blunt  there is absolutely 0 ways to make this happen unless you've been disowned or something ,X71
When you say voices  could you elaborate  Could be a mental illness ,X71
the best way is to not kill yourself  losing a child is an unbearable hole in your heart forever  if you can't stay alive for yourself  stay alive for those who love you,X71
But my family knows me  and they would like the joke  Suicide isn't always a bad thing  you know,X71
How do you feel ,X71
Hey  I have seen your posts and noticed that you haven't posted in a while  Are you okay  As a fellow teenage girl I truly hope you are okay and that you are somewhere safe now  pm me if you ever need to talk ,X71
I ended two years of feeling like I was being kept in cold storage   Now I am less alone  and growing a bit more as a person ,X71
I haven't been disowned but I have disappointed my mom so many times that I hope she has already given up on me,X71
21F  feel free to message me or w e  I'll try my best ,X71
hmm   well i would say i have become more comfortable with myself  so there is that plus  but really not much else  Survived a year i think  without actually attempting or going into IP ,X71
I know but its supposed to be serious in my opinion  If you love someone and they love you back why suicide  You at least got someone ,X71
I'm here for you buddy  you may feel like a monster but you have to grow from past experiences to get anywhere in life  though i fear it's too late for me  ,X71
Hi  thank you so much  Thinking about people that care about me is pretty much the thing that keeps me going ,X71
Cause people aren't a solution ,X71
Thanks    And MtF though I feel like I have always been a woman  Sorry for the delay  I work 12 hour shifts and am currently on night shift ,X71
Just curious  but what is your reason for suicide ,X71
Yesh of course  ,X71
whatever you did is behind you right now  it's a good thing no physical harm was done  care to elaborate some more ,X71
Just waking up for work dreading going in,X71
i live at home with my mom  just the issue left for now ,X71
Because fucking contrast  The color of red blood on white is fucking beautiful  My favorite thing in the world is blood on snow ,X71
That's a shame  Is there much music in your area  ,X71
You may be now  but you can learn for free online and a get a job after you've built a few things  ,X71
I love your ending  I feel over burdened when I look at the amount of shit I have to learn only to forget a year after the exam  ,X71
I feel like that all the time  just plain simple inadequacy ,X71
I stopped for my girlfriend   Yeah self harm helps   Of course it does    But I had to at least try something else ,X71
Do you have any tips on doing that  I dont seem to be able to ,X71
Wishing you strength  I hope you find solice in this ,X71
What is the method you have chosen ,X71
 One was expanding my social comfort zones    I tried this  It made me feel absolutely terrified and I retreated    but prayer gave me peace  I don't believe in any of that  Each to their own  ,X71
 What really brings you joy   Nothing I know of,X71
I've tried for years  Why should I believe that the future will be different ,X71
 Unless  of course  you want someone to take action    I do  I don't care what it is  but it'll be one last cry for help before silence ,X71
OP complains that everyone is fake as shit and you suggest he lie to a shrink  Does that seem wise ,X71
I don't really enjoy anything  so I don't have anything to spend money on  so no reason to get loans or whatever ,X71
I could help u find ways to solve those problems if you'd like,X71
Nah  It's cool  I made my decision ,X71
I survived it  so Yea  I know  But then just take enough of the right thing,X71
Thank you  I was very lucky  It was my drug tolerance that saved my life  I will certainly be fighting to be better this year  ,X71
Well I wish you peace my friend,X71
Thank you  I know it's not going to be easy  but I have more motivation now than before and we all must start with a step  ,X71
That's how I picture it too,X71
Lol it is insane to follow  but the story mode really helps get you geared up for multiplayer  I suck horribly at shooters but I have a blast playing it  It keeps me grounded and focused on it instead of the thoughts in my head ,X71
I don't know how long you've been having problems with your husband  but maybe consider marriage counseling ,X71
Feel free to pm  26F,X71
I live for the day when I turn 18 so I can finally start my life,X71
Is seeing someone an option  Ive found that going to see someone is really helpful in figuring out why you engage in self harm behaviors  what your triggers are and ways you can re train yourself to react to said triggers  ,X71
Ahh sorry I accidentally touched the submit button on my phone     Can any mod please delete this post  ,X71
Hope you change your mind  If not  may your end be quick and painless  Farewell my fellow dick joker   ,X71
It differs from person to person  I still hate the pain  I cut solely for making marks on my body  so the pain is what deters me from cutting  But I know plenty of people that can cut and don't struggle with the pain  ,X71
"I  too  can really relate  particularly to this "" I go into this with complete clarity and rationality ""  I just wonder if we are correct  But I know I sure do hurt  for the better part of all day every day ",X71
I have missed it every day for over a year and a half  save for one slip up ,X71
I'm so sorry you went through that  We're here for you  you're not alone  Need to talk ,X71
How are you today ,X71
Thanks for your answers  ,X71
I live kind of close to Chicago so live music is always around  I just do't go see any much because of my service dog  It can be too loud for her at times ,X71
It looked a lot like Overwatch   I couldn't follow that gameplay much either   Gameplay is just getting too quick for me nowadays ,X71
So I guess to feel less pain  you shouldnt cut so deep or you shouldnt cut the surface  If its between them is it less painful  ,X71
Yeah  it's not a perfect test obviously  there are some flaws in it  but it's kind of neat to see the different traits and whatnot  ,X71
You are welcome   ,X71
Do you want to talk  I am here  listening and willing ,X71
Huh  Small world  Friend of mine is from Chicago    What's your dogs name  I've two  Spaniel Jack Russell cross  We were gonna call them Walter and Jesse  but my sister vetoed Walter  so they're Sam and Jess now  ,X71
Her name is Kala   She goes everywhere with me   She's an Anatolian Shepherd   What region are you from ,X71
Awesome   Can I ask what she does for you  Service dogs have always fascinated me    I'm from Ireland  ,X71
Hey  Please message me  I think I might be in need of talking to someone via voice  I tnink i want to try to get things out  I dont know ,X71
20 M  If you need someone to talk to  I'm here for you  I'm open to a PM or just talking in here  whatever works best for you  Stay safe   ,X71
I don't have those apps but I've been raped  and I'm dating  for years  a male who was raped too  You're welcome to message me if you'd like ,X71
She helps to sense when anxiety attacks are on coming   I have PTSD,X71
I took 15 benedryl once and fell asleep  woke up in the middle of the night and prayed that I wouldn't die  My head and hands were so heavy      I told myself I would never do something that stupid again ,X71
It seems to me that you might be suffering from depression  Have you seen a doctor about these feelings ,X71
I'm willing to talk about whatever you need  It's very helpful and it feels very good to get things off of your chest  When you bottle it up like you did  it eats you away from the inside ,X71
"No but I plan  My parents are makeing jokes about my state and saying things like ""you only makeing excuses to don't study"" so talking about this with them is hard as fuck ",X71
I find it amazing that the dog can realise before the human  She sounds like a fantastic part of your life  ,X71
Loneliness is terrible  I've experienced it too  and it can be so suffocating  No one should be lonely  Would you like to talk  I would love to get to know you ,X71
Don't understand why that guy would try to actually incite suicide   I'm managing  ,X71
While this would certainly be a way to ask for help  have you considered asking in a more calm and collected way ,X71
I've done that for over 2 years  It hasn't worked  I've lost all patience for these people,X71
I feel this way all the time,X71
what part of math are you having trouble with ,X71
That's very true  I never thought of it that way  It does make sense  I'll try not too  Thank you ,X71
We have been to counselling but he doesn't want to go anymore because he feels the counsellor only blames him,X71
Hey I'm experiencing the same thing pretty much    Just hit me up if you wanna talk about anything  I know how it feels to be lonely and feeling like theres no one seeing you ,X71
It's ultimately up to you  but it may help to keep in mind the consequences of what you say and how you say it  ,X71
You can message me  if you want ,X71
What consequences  I literally want to kill myself  I have nothing to lose,X71
Treatment wise  as I referred to in my other comment  and how professionals evaluate your state of mind   being deemed incompetent and such  ,X71
"So if I give them a totally unambiguous ""I am not mentally stable""  surely that's a good  thing ",X71
I feel you  don't despair because you're not alone  Im here if you want to talk,X71
Repay the kindness and spread it to others ,X71
Hey are you there   You seem like you have a lot going on  and maybe you want to vent or chat ,X71
Let's talk  shan't we  What's on your mind right now ,X71
How old are you  What do you think about your dad right now  and do you want to distance yourself away from him or try to help him ,X71
Sorry im a bit late  29 mtf feel free to message me ,X71
I'm doing great  You caught me at the right time  Got anything to vent ,X71
If it doesn't go your way  I'll be ready whenever to talk ,X71
Yeah you build up a tolerance and don't worry  this isn't insensitive at all ,X71
Ohhh maybe One Day we will meet  me as a singer and you as a spectator  And we will never know because reddit is so anonymous  But if you're there  keep your eyes open for a blonde lyric mezzo ,X71
How is it not my fault they say it is because I dress slutty and they couldn't have raped me because Im gross and ugly,X71
You posted this on the depression subreddit already and what the guys on there says is true  You were raped  You're not gross and you're not a slut  You should talk to your family and the police,X71
I know i just want different options because i think its my fault they said Im to ugly and fat to be raped,X71
I am 22 I do feel like distancing myself from him but I still live at home with my parents and brother and I can't drive and don't have my driver's licence,X71
So far I am just glad you reached out to us  OP maybe tell us a little but about your situation  so we can work at this together    ,X71
Maybe he doesn't want to believe  I think parents have excellent skills at making reality up as they go along  Keep pushing  you need and deserve this ,X71
That's not how it works  They didn't have your permission  they raped you  These are not the kind of guys who's opinions you should listen to,X71
It's hard trying to stay positive barley have friends  and we have class together ,X71
That's the price you have to pay to save time hello,X71
I'm lonely too  It's devastating  Would you like to talk  PM me  ,X71
Why do you want to know  Does it make someone's harm any less valid or deserving of attention ,X71
I don't do it for the pain  I do it for the comfort of having marks on my body  So I'm with you on this feeling ,X71
I'm confused  what do you mean  ,X71
I has gotten less painful for me ,X71
Okay  Do you feel as if it would be worth it ,X71
Just because you're a girl doesn't mean you have to be feminine  I mean 'butch lesbian' is a whole thing and that's okay  ,X71
Why would they do something so horrible,X71
Don't do that  Go talk to the girl instead,X71
What's the girl like  Do you two get along ,X71
Okay  I understand ,X71
Do you feel like even if you make a bunch of changes again  you'll still end up back where you are  You sound like you feel hopeless and trapped ,X71
That's terrible  No  they should not be able to refuse you a transfusion  especially if it's that serious  Go to multiple hospitals if you have to  just please  get it done  ,X71
No  I think relationships are fine and better with me as a woman   It's just that part of me feels that I would be more comfortable in my own skin if I had been born male ,X71
I don't know if I do it for attention  but that's not the only reason  so I wana have description of person who do this for attention  When you count someone as attention seeker  what he do etc ,X71
I don't know if I do it for attention  but that's not the only reason  so I wana have description of person who do this for attention  When you count someone as attention seeker  what he do etc ,X71
I mean there's no way of measuring how valiant someone's mental disorder is compared to others so you can't really have a legitimate argument about it anyway ,X71
I tried to get into overwatch  but I couldn't get into it  Titanfall    is pretty quick  have to have fast reflexes,X71
i just feel like if i do this  i'll either get help or i'll die so it won't be necessary but im scared,X71
Ive told her and she's said she understands but she wouldn't be angry  that she won't ever leave me etc but i just want her to hate me so she doesn't suffer ,X71
I really do  we haven't known each other long but it was an instant connection and i could talk to her endlessly,X71
You know she'll suffer less if you stay with her,X71
She'll suffer more by being with somebody like me  The things I've said and done to people  I cannot stand myself  She deserves the good  not the bad ,X71
If you do this she'll get the bad  If you don't think you're good for her it would be better to let her down gently and just walk away,X71
That's my point exactly  It's like telling people with depression they've got no reason to be depressed because they have XYZ privileges  ,X71
 maybe someone with training  yes  a couple years ago  he blamed me alone for how i feel,X71
That's what I'm trying to do  she's too good to hurt,X71
Killing yourself isn't the same as walking away ,X71
"I was obsessed with scars long before I started self harming  I'd say at least 50  of the reason I self harm overall is for the scars  probably more even  So just know you're not alone and it's definitely still ""real self harm"" ",X71
Hey  How you doing  ,X71
What's the difference  I'll be out of her life either way and she won't have any emotional attachments bonding her to me anymore ,X71
She'll know you killed yourself  and if she cares about you  that will hurt  I'm not trying to guilt you but if you care about this girl this is not the way to do things  you won't be sparing her,X71
Oh right I understand    ,X71
i dont think you need to have sex for it  its normally in human nature to desire it  and its not like i never fallen in love before  i still never wanted to have sex with that person,X71
Sounds like you are facing some tough situations    and it is all relative really  it might not be as bad as others  but it is yours    that's what makes it important   What's going on ,X71
That's wonderful to hear  and thank you for the update   we really appreciate it as most of the time we don't hear anything back  Here's to your new life ,X71
No  you were raped  If you can  please  please inform the authorities over this  You may want to visit  r rapecounseling as well  I'm so sorry you have to go through this ,X71
Ahh  Maybe you should take a break from each other for a while  let things clear your mind  a change in setting   ,X71
Hi OP  I'm sorry that there are so many problems piling up on top of you  Have you ever considered getting a counsellor or therapist to work through some of these feelings with  ,X71
I would care    PM me   ,X71
Exactly  and in fact as a prospective screen writer you have an opportunity to make an impact on people to help explore and expand the use of language in more sophisticated ways,X71
I wasn't there when that went down  but I'm glad you managed to get past that stuff  mate  Well done ,X71
I don't think that's attention seeking  Scars might be like tattoos for you  read up on  scarification  ,X71
Not sure  I want to know the ending of GoT  But that seems a stupid reason  Everyone are making big steps in live like becoming parents  getting married etc  Other than that I would like to travel the world ,X71
That sucks  What made you feel like it was a waste of time ,X71
I don't know  Some people love to hurt others  I can't explain that because I'm the complete difference  I hate myself when someone gets hurt because of me  so I can't sleep anymore  am not eating etc     ,X71
"I think we talked a few days ago   Is this just for conversation    For argument sake  and maybe you don't want to hear this  but sometimes being social creates the ""luck"" by creating connections ",X71
"I want to talk to you  I do not know what ""placing a plague"" suppose so mean  and whatever it is I'm not scared  Reply so I can share some details  ",X71
Then I'm not surprised that you don't feel it was worth it  That sounds like you either got the wrong kind of therapy  or a therapist who didn't know what they were doing  I'm sorry you had that experience  ,X71
If it becomes really unbearable and you are in treat of seriously harming yourself you may want to check into your local hospitals ER  You deserve help all right  You don't need to suffer ,X71
I concur with others  Help spread the kindness  ,X71
I'm here  I'm reading everything  I meant like I feel like an ocean and each time I storm I erode a piece of the people closest to me,X71
PM me  I'm going through terrible heartbreak myself right now  Would love some camaraderie  No one in my life seems to care about my pain anymore  They just want to be critical  ,X71
Hey there  I hope you are still with us OP  What you describe soudns like depression  and while the social stigma on that is still immense  it is possible to treat most forms of depression  try to seek proffesional help  Best of luck ,X71
Oh I know how much they care  I know all of what I would do to them  I know it's selfish  I know it's dumb  ,X71
I'm in a similar place in my life  If you want to chat  PM me  I'd love for the opportunity to help someone else to get my mind off my own suckiness  ,X71
That's terrible  I'm here if you want to talk,X71
I've had help before  It really just boils down to the fact my brain is fucked up and I can't be happy  I'm just tired of thinking  ,X71
19M also from the UK that was very strange to read  it felt like I wrote this  I feel exactly this way lonely and all and quite handsome  Are we twins  XD,X71
I know what this will do to them  I warned them last night that they're talking to a wall  I'm just numb to it but I can't take it  ,X71
Only you think so  When you feel very depressed  you automatically assume everyone around feels somewhat the same  but in reality they don't  I know how it feels ,X71
Do you think it's a good idea that I never had sex with him  I'm just regretting it right now  I will never get to experience that with him ,X71
Sigh  I'm just beyond it  I posted here mostly because I want to write out my thoughts before I go  It's sad  I know what will happen to them but  They'll be fine in the end  ,X71
I know and I wanted to take it last saturday but as I wrote this shit broke my motivation on everything    Not sure where I wanna go  maybe something like canada or something  I like mountains and forests ,X71
I'm just tired of needing people  I don't deserve their help  ,X71
Yeah i think it probably was  He doesn't really seem to be a sexually responsible kind of guy  not really the kind of guy you should have any 'experiences' with ,X71
Since I made it through the day  I'll share the note in the original post  I changed names but otherwise its all there   I wrote more today  per your suggestion and it might have kept me around  You made a difference ,X71
You seem like  you have a lot of problems on your mind  But you can't really tackle them properly all at once  PM me  maybe we can find where to start  I really want to talk to someone right now  ,X71
I figured that as much  but if she hates me then it won't hurt nearly as much  y'know ,X71
But she doesn't hate you,X71
That's not what I am or was saying suggesting  Again it's your decision on how to approach this  ,X71
It might seem more severe to her  I don't know what she thinks  and I don't mind if she calls texts me asking to come over because she wants to be with someone  but it feels to me like she was lying to me ,X71
Has she behaved in a manipulative way in the past ,X71
Nope  I just can't wait until the day karma comes back for him in some form or another  But I don't need to linger on it,X71
You're right  but it's good you're willing to talk about it  Here if you need me ,X71
I'm dead serious  it shocked me so much I made a throw away just to comment ,X71
Haha I am   It hurts to have to rely on people  I would go to the ends of the earth for any of them  no questions asked  ,X71
I generally dislike them  I have a X shaped scar on my wrist I find myself looking at a lot  It reminds me of the events that drove me to do that  Not sure if that's a good or bad thing really ,X71
well    It's really hard to have passion for helping others nowadays  because you dont really know how can you help them  However  this is yet again a common problem   Anyway you think you overwhelm others with your sadness  ,X71
You're welcome  Stay strong ,X71
Not yet  She's bound to when she sees how awful i am,X71
Well  I don't know  but she does always show off her wounds  if she scratches her thighs she wears shorts  if she scratches her arms  she wears t shirts  so obviously she is needing attention ,X71
Then treat her well  She likes who you are  be yourself,X71
How can i be myself when i don't even know who i am  why i do the things i do ,X71
Ask her who you are,X71
Yeah  that does sound like she's just doing it for attention  In that case  I think the solution would be to find the cause of the attention seeking behaviour  I can't really offer any advice on that  though  I don't know enough  ,X71
Got too drunk and sad last night  Ended up in a circle of all my friends comforting me  but I hate the way their eyes look at me now  Especially the ones closest to me  They're just getting tired of me  ,X71
Sigh  I just wish I was stronger  ,X71
I'm glad to read this  Stay strong dude ,X71
Like  I think I'm going to keep going  There's something here worth fighting for  But I'm really tired of trying and failing and beating myself up so often  ,X71
TBH I think I know why  she lives in a home for troubled teens  she's very violent  and I think she might feel rejected by her parents or something ,X71
She'll just tell me all of this fake  'positive' stuff about me which isn't true  She just thinks it is because she's delusioned herself into thinking i'm a good person,X71
Then be that good person  for both of your sakes ,X71
I love seeing bigger scars  To me it is a sign that effort was not wasted and that more pain is on show  I must go over healed scratches until the area becomes a dark blotch ,X71
Thanks bub  Every inch of me is telling me to do it still  but the calm in my heart is just giving me a list of shit that I need to do  ,X71
sorry  Im not regular reddit user  ,X71
Can you get a family member to come pick you up and go looking for him ,X71
I wish i could  but there's no good in me  Perhaps there was a long time ago  but whatever good there was in me is long gone ,X71
Haha the thing is they're the most accepting  perfectly healthy group for me  I just think that continually watching their friend never improves and suffer does something to them  ,X71
You're wrong and she knows that  If she wants to help you let her,X71
Can you contact any of his friends ,X71
I have done that  hoping someone will see him and tell me,X71
I'm gonna use my grandma's car when she gets back ,X71
Sorry you're going through all of this  your parents  depression  all of it   Your parents  especially your dad  sound really stubborn and painful to deal with ,X71
Ah  definently let's hope  I've gone through this it's really fucking terrifying isn't it,X71
Horrifying  I'm so scared I can barely breathe ,X71
In my case my employer has an EAP  employee assistance program   It gave me 5 free visits a year  My current doc gives me a slight break  Though 2016 had been the costliest I have ever had ,X71
I can't burden somebody as pure as her like that  this is better for everybody,X71
It's like no matter what i do  its never right  i hurt people and i don't stop  hurt people  hurt people  I'm talking to her rn and its hurting her so much,X71
It's either the burden of support or the burden of loss  We both know the former is lighter,X71
He turned his phone off I guess ,X71
Fuck it sucks  Have you contacted police  You could tell them the car he's driving and his appearance and see if they can keep an eye out ,X71
Yeah  depression doesn't need a reason  It's chemicals in your brain  they don't a reason to do what they do ,X71
He pulled the battery out yeah,X71
Not sure if this is allowed  please let me know if it's not  mods  and I'll delete it   but if you're in the US  this site will find free and low cost clinics in your area   http   www findcare org,X71
Do you believe in the afterlife ,X71
Same life is so meaningless,X71
I feel that it would satisfy my self esteem and make me feel more comfortable and secure  if I had been born that way  not If I transitioned ,X71
Farewell then  random redditor  May your afterlife be a lot better than this one ,X71
How much does it cost you per session that passes the 5 a year limit  and how long are sessions if you don't mind me asking ,X71
What did you study Do you have a job,X71
I'm scared to because his license is good in Georgia but not here so he'd just get arrested and I fear that will make it worse   but I dunno what else I can do at this point and I'm leaning towards calling the cops ,X71
same man  Hang in there  Contemplating calling the suicide hotline  but I don't want to get put in the looney bin ,X71
a centimetre is just under half an inch  2 5's of an inch   do you mean millimetre  1 25 of an inch  ,X71
If he just changed his number today then I'm guessing he's not planning on doing anything harmful to himself anytime soon  ,X71
It's all up to you  and if you've exhausted all your resources I would call the police ,X71
No  I think I'll just stop brain function and be nothing  ,X71
That's why I'm asking if that's what that is  that's a good thing if he's changing his number ,X71
I have a business degree   I'm working a shitty manual labor job that I suspect is making me sick   I work with chemicals and shit  ,X71
Sorry to say but it's impossible to die only from Xanax  Benzodiazepines toxicity alone are very low    You gonna end in ER,X71
"Define ""nothing""   ",X71
Your life will always mean something  please know that    PM me if you need ,X71
I care so no you can't end it sorry ,X71
Ah  yeah that  I was honestly just using it ad part of the metaphor  it was late and I wasn't really thinking  thanks for the correction  ,X71
I've done that once  I dont want to do it again  I just want to die  No more lonely nights  no more lonely days  I just need something to take the pain away  now the drugs don't work ,X71
Well  I read a good thing here on Reddit once  But I'll feel  or not feel  each of my cells die  and slowly my brain will cease to fire  My thoughts will stop  Being conscious will no longer be a possible concept ,X71
Sigh  Dammit  I was going to mix with buesbar  ,X71
The problem is that I'm coming here from  r all and I've made a gut response  Now that I've read all the posting guidelines  I'm trying my best to do the right thing ,X71
I don't believe our relationship will ever be the same   But even if I do see talk to her  what's the point  What I am doing is wrong  even if it wasn't  I'll never get that happiness back ,X71
Thank you so much  This did help me  And also thank you for not judging me  Much love ,X71
Or sleeping pills  ,X71
He has made two purchases  one for 21 even at a gas station meaning he probably topped it off to being even and got gas  Hoping this is a good sign     Still nothing though,X71
You don't have to   I only posted on here so I can get everything I've wanted to say off my chest  thank you for listening ,X71
I'll be starting grad school in a couple of weeks  hopefully I'll meet people there    You're a parent  I can't wait to be a mother one day  I hope to find someone to have children with  ,X71
21 so much time left to change things brotha ,X71
I am so sorry that you are in pain   I hope you will get through this   Do you have anyone at all that you can trust to talk to ,X71
Maybe you didn't give him enough space to recover from such a shock  Then again  he was in no right to act like that  Soon enough  once he clears his head  he'll realize and regret his actions   hopefully ,X71
link her to this post,X71
Please notify the police and keep us updated ,X71
I am sorry to hear you are ill  and nobody seems to care  I hope you feel better soon  Is it unusual that you have to study during break  ,X71
You realize OP said his friend is dead  right  He's not going to clear his head   ,X71
Are you still married   I can't remember if you said you still were  but that CAN work   I don't want to go into all that romance y glop  but things do tend to get better ,X71
Us redditors would care and I'm sure more people than you think would,X71
You are obviously in a lot of pain from the disconnect between your physical and emotional realities ,X71
Sorry to say  but my friend already committed suicide  He did so many irrational things when he was alone  The dude's whole life was a mess  Honestly I believe if I didn't help sooner  things would've gotten way worse quicker ,X71
It sounds as if you've had some tough things to deal with already  and you are still very young   Do you have a live person you can trust to talk to ,X71
Actually your family may develop depression would could lead to suicide so option 2 as your family would care and would be more encouraging than anyone you would imagine    trust me ,X71

Yes  it is all right to want attention  to want to be loved  to want to feel   Do reach out  in person if possible  or post here as the other person suggests ,X71
That's a shame  Not your fault  though  You're fine for thinking that way ,X71
Ah    whoops ,X71
Thank you very much for your advice  I'll absolutely look into this some more and then give it a try  Really  honestly appreciated so much  Thank you,X71
There must be a reason you have low self esteem   The fact that you get rejected by girls does not mean that you will never find one who likes you   Do you think you're trying too hard or looking for the wrong kind of girl ,X71
Preferably not  I'm ironically not a fan of permanent marks on my body  and as such not really a tattoo person  Thank you for the continued advice  I've given it a look  Cheers    ,X71
I hope you'll be fine for a long time   Is there someone you can talk to about your problems ,X71

I've been talking with people for years  with professionals with really good people  and I've failed them and myself too many times to keep trying  I talk and they listen but I don't know if I really do,X71
I agree   I feel responsible for what has happened and need to make it right ,X71
How have you failed them or yourself  I don't understand  ,X71
At least they are still looking   Good luck   I really hope you get a diagnosis ,X71
I wonder  too  I worry there's something I'm missing that I could do  But it's been almost two decades now  If there were a way  I would have found it by now ,X71
We are  but it's hard dealing with multiple doctors who may or may not have access to each other's notes ,X71

I'm pretty sure it's nothing I can control  My life is not terrible  I'm just suffering from clinical depression  ,X71
It sounds like you know far more about the system than I do  I  can't say that I know the right answer  It's your head  and your choices  All I can do is offer a bit of support and a friendly ear  ,X71
Its alright  metric can be confusing for those not used to it   ,X71

I think t's just that a lot of them don't understand  can't understand   Like depression     Also  this kind of talk belongs in  r Incels imo ,0NT
Hang in there brother ,0NT
You have to eventually understand that you deserve so much more and that you're worth more than being someone's victim  Don't go back   Be strong and walk away for good  Keeping you in my thoughts and wishing you strength  ,0NT
What I would do  I'd be mad  and just not talk to them for a while till they realize you gone  if they don't  then forget em' and get new friends  you don't gotta wait and see while still being there,0NT
oh hell yes   i am going to bed with pills long before any of that new years shit is on ,0NT
This man has won 2016  Congrats OP,0NT
Showers  lots of em  Also luck and decent appearance   Just kidding  But the last 10 stories I have read from so called 'Ex FA's' were just people that never really been FA or just were at the right place right time  ,0NT
I completely understand  I have a bunch of my own that are kept close too  Take care ,0NT
Plenty of people don't like it  Totally fine and normal  Maybe some other forms of intoxication like weed will agree with you more  ,0NT
I got invited to stuff today but I'm so exhausted that I kinda just wish I could be at home and do nothing ,0NT
Why can't gfs hubs father with fiance ,0NT
Have you ever looked into the eyes of a woman who hates your guts   I have   I would rather be FA  which I have been for decades ,0NT

I'm a cop caller  Because even if it isn't sound ordinance curfew  it's still disturbing the peace regardless the hour   And I pay good money to live in my home  Not going to have a day or evening ruined by the inconsiderate ,0NT
"You're not an FA  you're an asshole and a ""nice guy""  That's the difference between that sub and this one ",0NT
I'll take this under advisement  Thanks  ,0NT

Published a couple papers with a few more in the pipeline    Started going to therapy  stopped self harming    Lost a bit of weight  gained a bit of muscle  started wearing contacts and I think I look significantly better  ,0NT
Seek therapy to work through this if it's weighing on your mind  Perhaps someone who is trained in psychoanalysis  ,0NT
I don't much about you but it seems like you've been thru hellish things  Way to go for overcoming them all  You're a fighter and keep winning every battle  But for now  I hope you party first or have some fun  Lol,0NT
No matter the reasoning for quitting ,0NT
Personal Support Worker  she does all the dirty work ,0NT
Even if I was completely stressed because of a co worker  ,0NT
That's a funny thing to see from someone in  r foreveralone ,0NT
They don't care about you and won't respond back  you'll just seem desperate   so no  Sorry but Happy New Year though ,0NT

No problem  We had a similar issue in our house when there was a small break in the line and debris was getting into it  ,0NT
Oh yeah  good ol' comment section  Many sites don't have one anymore though  But there's always YouTube lol,0NT
That girl was just an asshole  Fuck her ,0NT
i'd like that idea  for academic purposes of course,0NT
I'd offer to help but I'd probably make things worse  ,0NT
  hearing some success stories  No  thank you,0NT
Howd you get it  ,0NT

I'm 25 and I've never had a sip of alcohol either  Ultimately it's up to you but my opinion is you shouldn't have to drink alcohol to have fun or to have a social life ,0NT
You look at them and tell them to grow the fuck up   Then you don't think about them again    Screw pretty assholes   man  ,0NT
 ALL WOMEN WANT CHAD  Well I learned something about myself today ,0NT
too bad being a fat fuck isn't what women want  BUT FAT WOMEN CAN HAVE ATTRACTIVE SKINNY AND RIPPED GUYS INTO THEM ,0NT
well i'm sure you had boyfriends while in your 20's,0NT
We love you and no you don't,0NT
I'm doing it for myself  I know no one will ever love me even if I was attractive  But running and exercise makes me feel better  ,0NT
Sounds sketchy as fuck   Definitely get a new lock ,0NT
Honestly I'm just hoping 2017 some things start bouncing my way  ,0NT
I know exactly how you feel  2016 was a huge shitshow for me too  but as people say  once you've hit rock bottom  there's only one way to go   ,0NT
I've been there  exact same situation  I decided to man up  ,0NT
I just thought of something I can do      goggle the names of folks and see who all have died         who I have out lived   I'm pretty damn old so this could take awhile  ,0NT

No I'm in Bama  let's meet halfway ,0NT
You are not a lover of peace  are you ,0NT
Oh hhheeyyy   Glad I found you all  This is my third New Years in a row alone  Hanging out with my cats and watching movies and drinking   And tomorrow's my birthday  Here's to the best for all of us in 2017 ,0NT
I just did and it got downvoted   ,0NT
r bestof material right here,0NT
Got sick of Minecraft already ,0NT

Honestly you should talk to her I been in relationships like this before they don't always work out just do what makes you happy if she's your friend she'll treat you with respect and care about you good luck is all I can say I hope things work out ,0NT
That'd be weird   Getting catfished from one of   us  ,0NT
Oh my gosh  This sounds awful  You don't deserve to be treated that way at all ,0NT
How do you try  Because if you're keeping in touch  you're indulging yourself and your love ,0NT
Girls can't fuck a personality   Just sayi'n   I can make women laugh up and down the street and do  every day at my work place    It don't make a damn bit of difference  though   still ugly ,0NT
I'll be home alone with my cat  I have a little wine left and a lot of snacks so it should be OK    Maybe I'll get Uncharted 4  Good distraction ,0NT
keep it p and make sure she comes first  and frequently  you won't regret it ,0NT
I wish I was old enough to get drunk so it would be easier to end it all,0NT
Congrats my man  it'll only get easier from here on out ,0NT
Make a good change this coming new years OP  Leave him and start fresh this year  HERE'S TO 2017   pours you a shot of whiskey    ,0NT

Best of luck to you   ,0NT
Nothing new to me another year gone by  plus my birthday is in less than 2 3 days  What better way than to spend your big two zero than home  secluded same as all my other birthdays  ,0NT
i'm sure its much more common than you think  most likely happens to guys more than girls because girls don't have to be the initiators,0NT
At least you get invited lol,0NT
Sounds to me like youre problem lies more in staying in the coversation  You should practice asking questions  When ppl seem like theyre ignoring you  try interjecting with questions that actually steer the conversation ,0NT
I agree with egobot  I needed four ,0NT
Which state and city ,0NT
"Agree with  u JuliaH7931  Best to explore these issues with a qualified therapist   The idea of repressed memories of childhood abuse has been pretty much discredited IIRC  The ""recovered memories"" in many cases turned out to be fabrications ",0NT

I changed my brothers diaper when I was 6  I wanted to help my mom out since she was napping  ,0NT
Thank you for the kind words  Its the fact that I don't have someone waiting for me when I get back more than the letters ,0NT
The correction  and telling them to re read is fine  but just drop telling ppl how they will feel ,0NT
Have a suggestion for the interrogation phase   2 second pause after hearing each question  breathe out  then answer quietly but clearly  void of emotional challenge ,0NT

I have pretty low standards but it doesn't really matter because im never going to get into a situation where it matters lol,0NT
Ahhh  to be young and in love and in Berlin   Edit  in,0NT
Damn  I feel so bad for you  This sounds like a shitty situation to be in  How long have you known the friend that invited you  How long have you been at the wedding dinner already ,0NT
You mean your fuck buddy ,0NT
And this is why you're FA,0NT
I have a very beautiful cubic zirconia ring that was not expensive at all  You could not tell the difference  Also  watch the Adam Ruins Everything on the topic  It's great ,0NT

It's a hit or miss  Mostly miss ,0NT
TLDR of every ex fa success story is they were late bloomers who did normie stuff and it worked out for them or they got lucky and girlfriended married the first woman who showed interest in them ,0NT
I don't know what advise to give  but here's an internet hug ,0NT
sorry for bad wrigting ,0NT
Well they're my favorite football team and gives me joy ,0NT
The rings are about her and for her  so she gets to decide what happens  ,0NT
ayooo     but in seriousness  toys or just go out and get some  Don't be afraid of your sexuality  Just be safe about it,0NT
That's interesting  I was under the impression that repressed memories were entirely legitimate   I hope OP figures out what he feels like is an issue ,0NT
  complains about feminism    complains about being shamed   Hmm    ,0NT
I feel ya  Good luck out there  though  Maybe you'll make a bunch of normie friends at Basic and end up busting out of FA after all ,0NT
The man's trying to make some change in his life  Let him be ,0NT
I'm really happy for you  I really hope you have a great year,0NT
That's basically my plan  yes ,0NT
Thanks  I'll check it out  Property management tends to lag to the point where minor fixes are just worth solving for myself   Thanks again ,0NT

 Do you need someone to talk to ,0NT
 I'm sorry  do you want to talk about it ,0NT
Then I suggest waiting  Don't make any decisions until you are sure  If you are never sure  then so be it  ,0NT
I'm pretty sure you can ask to have a photo of you taken off facebook  Check their policies,0NT
Damn  I saw this too late  Would have gone with you but I literally got off work at 8,0NT
Any other ideas  ,0NT
I understand how you feel  but maybe try baking apple slices with a bit of cinnamon on them  Should be very bearable and tasty at that point  If it doesn't work out  let me know  I'll come up with a few things  ,0NT
Good luck and have lots of fun ,0NT
I promise I'm not knocking him at all and I apologize if it seemed like I was ,0NT
If it's any consolation  staying home  watching TV  and drinking is basically my plan too ,0NT
Thanks  Ill update in 13 weeks ,0NT
In my book if you dident do this your pretty much a lame,0NT
My plans with friends fell through  Girl drama is the worst  Most likely going to cry myself to sleep tonight  ,0NT
In NYC  Absolutely    NYC is where you go when you don't want to stop the party  Being from NY  I know a few people that have that exact plan  You leave before it burns you out though ,0NT
It's really down to what OP feels  but I wouldn't do more than 5    An idea is not worth shit  Ideas are dime a dozen  It is implementation and execution that matter  ,0NT
 really nice  What an understatement,0NT
Good luck not getting her pregnant ,0NT
I am assuming you have some hobby relaxing activity that can at least even out some of the tension  right  Having an outlet is important ,0NT
She's a junior and has been considering home school before any of this happened  I'll discuss this with her as well  Thank you so much for reaching out  ,0NT

happy new year guys  Both my sisters out with their husbands    I really wish I had a girlfriend  This sucks  but gl next year ,0NT
Looks is what gets people interested in the first place  you fall in love with someone's personality after you fall in love with someone's look  There's no fix to this  it's purely biological  And it sucks ,0NT
Still two FA guys in that clip ,0NT
It seems wrong to use people like that ,0NT
Congrats   Happy new year  ,0NT
I am not okay with it  I'm not sure I'm capable of being in an open relationship  ,0NT
Hey man I'm in the same boat  Wanna grab a drink  ,0NT
Ok I will try to talk more and make some thing happen  Thanks for the reply  ,0NT

Broke my heart while reading this  but it's so true   But where will he go  He's supposed to stay here until March  I'll feel bad for just throwing him out on the street ,0NT
You're most welcome  Happy new year to you both ,0NT
  Even if someone oozed confidence but was still lacking in the looks department he would be constantly rejected left and right   Can confirm  this is pretty much a description of my life ,0NT
I just decided to do what I knew wouldn't lead to me being upset or angry and drank by myself at home  I can't even go outside anymore without wanting to throttle someone ,0NT

Is it    Is it  ,0NT
It can help a little every now and then for some people  but for a lot of people it can actually made depression worse  Drinking alone or regularly is far more likely to make it worse ,0NT
I had completely resigned to never meeting anyone to spend my life with  I found someone that I hit it off this October  And while it didn't work out for various reasons  it made me realize that these things pop up at the weirdest moments ,0NT
In my opinion  probably the best thing about 2016 is that it's over now ,0NT
It's because most lack the social skills  ,0NT
  Maybe get some distance if you're finding it hard   Yes that's exactly his problem  Couldn't resist   I agree with your advice ,0NT
Alcohol helped me by being more social  Which girls like  But I like weed more  Just more healthier  ,0NT
  shower obsession  Still haven't gotten old for me  HNY  7 AM here  very quiet ,0NT

Yeah I feel like I'm wasting the time half the time it's not response ,0NT
Uhm yeah  leave  Get the f out of that relationship now  You're only hurting yourself  Once a cheater  usually always a cheater  This is the THIRD time and you're asking for advice  Girl  know your worth ,0NT
congrats  my mom is the only one who has called me so far  technically it's not 2017 for another 45 minutes in my time zone  so i'm gonna wait by the phone for additional calls ,0NT

No its just her friend is only 18 and still with her parents so it was the parents rule that they could celebrate but no driving or guys over ,0NT
 all I get is being ghosted  guys over 60  or guys 10 states over   Not sure if this is actually what the gay community is like in general  or I just relate so closely that I don't know anything else ,0NT
Midnight hit and the fireworks went off  I stupidly turned on the TV and saw the couples kissing which hit me in the feels  Everyone is having fun out there and I'm here alone pathetically sobbing  This is hitting me directly in the feels  ,0NT
Good for you man  Way to start the new year off right  ,0NT
Thanks  You seem nice as well  I doubt 2017 will be better for any of us but maybe we will get lucky  It's doubtful considering our past  so I'm just hoping a few of us make it out  ,0NT
  At least if you're a gay guy you can still get laid whenever you want  I mean  if it's going to be with that 60 year old dude in the corner with genital warts then sure    ,0NT
Haha  thanks  Yeah  it's 12 25 am here in The Eastern US ,0NT
Maybe it's selfish   I think I'm afraid that he will move on and I'll be left with nothing  But leading him on isn't right  either  ,0NT
That is something I've never even thought about  So trippy ,0NT
I thought it'd be either suicide or hooker ,0NT
Ahh that's fair  Guess you will plan your evening a little better next time  ,0NT

People don't adopt because they have to  but because they want to  Adoption could mean a better life for the child and the new parents ,0NT
Unfortunately  yes     I want to go to sleep  but it's kind of impossible right now  It's so loud and noisy because of the fireworks  ,0NT
Ack  That doesn't sound too bad to be honest  At least you have a pet keeping you company  That's better than nothing  ,0NT
Probably not  despite the social interaction and pretty girls i think this experience has shown me that i do want to be alone forever which honestly im cool with,0NT
Ohhhhhhhh  Sorry  I'm not quite familiar with Italy's education curriculum  but I'm sure Biology  Anatomy  and Chemistry are all offered so I would start there at least ,0NT

Fedora  neckbeard and a swarm of flies because of not showering is not enough ,0NT
amazon overnight it  I dont know  get it yourself then fly over there  not much you could do at this point,0NT
That sounds like the type of person I'm going to grow up to be  The weird one who stays up all night and sleeps all through the day and has no real job  Then I'll probably complain because I couldn't and didn't get enough sleep  ,0NT
 definitely meant more scary  thanks,0NT
Oh my god    That sounds horrible  I know this won't be much condolences to you  but happy birthday and happy new year  Hopefully  this year will be a better year  even if it started out shitty ,0NT
I have to go pick up my little brother from a party sometime soon  So I was told  Hope he calls me soon  I'm falling asleep  ,0NT
Even if I do screw it up  now I know it's possible  and I've already learned a lot ,0NT
If it's an electric eggbeater you probably broke it  You can get another for like  20 on Amazon  Just use it for only eggs in the future   ,0NT
Congrats buddy  That being said   obviously martial arts is not close to the most efficient way to transform your body  I'm good with everything else haha,0NT
thanks  same to you  ,0NT
We just broke 4000    quite sad tbh,0NT
Why didn't you just not drink so you could stay at the party ,0NT
I meant transforming physically and mentally   No other single physical activity does that as well as martial arts ,0NT
Yeah  I get what you mean  I feel like I'm wasting my life away  Maybe you can pick up some hobbies  Are you interested in anything in particular  ,0NT
I dont know but this has been the nail in the coffin for whether or not im deciding to be live alone forever because things always end up not working out or there are 50 solutions and im too stupid to see them,0NT
You didn't read the sticky thread  did you ,0NT
I wish I could fall asleep and fix my life  In fact  I should probably try to sleep  But anyway  I hope you guys have a happy new year    ,0NT
Hell  id drive ,0NT
Weight doesn't belong on this list ,0NT
Hey  thanks dude  It's kinda nice knowing that I'm not alone  even though I obviously wish that you didn't have all that  I appreciate your comment regardless   Either way  happy new year  man  may it be a good one  ,0NT
Why are those 2 things related  ,0NT
 At last    All the best  Don't come back ,0NT
Congrats  Where how did you meet her ,0NT
Interesting  So you now have lasting relationships with these people  or otherwise stemming from these interactions ,0NT
The hardest part isn't the exercising  It's the time sacrifice and diet change   Make sure you find a routine that isn't longer than 30 45 minutes  I was doing a 2 hour routine and it burned me out after 6 months ,0NT
Sounds to good to be real ,0NT
Which ever side you dont agree with,0NT
I met her while camping lmao  She was actually at the campsite next to mine,0NT
Why are you presenting that as a fact  It's pretty strange to use such definitive language when describing things that can not be proven  ,0NT
That's what I've been telling myself for a long time now   I'm still waiting for the let down  but that's dangerous to do  because subconsciously you're undermining yourself and your relationship by thinking like that ,0NT
Probably  I think I will wait for his birthday instead  Thanks ,0NT
Overheard my divorced neighbor lady today talking about last year's NYE  She was fed up with poverty and shit and couldn't wait to get hammered at midnight  then she proceeded to vomit all over the Christmas tree  Happy New Year ,0NT
I've relocated and we're no longer in contact but yes  the friendships that came of those approaches were just like the friendships which stemmed from meeting people at school or university or a workplace ,0NT
GOOD FOR YOU FRIEND  I HOPE NOTHING BUT THE BEST FOR YOU AND YOU HAVE MY LOVE AND SUPPORT  EDIT  caps,0NT
Oh I'm consciously undermining myself   You're story seems so alien to me I'm a having trouble accepting any part of it as true  ,0NT
What do you mean by fake exactly  ,0NT
What a way to start the year  Happy new year to you as well mate     have a good one  ,0NT
"""be yourself""   but here's a list of things you need to do and how to dress and act  yeah  ok",0NT
Are your shoes loose  If your feet slide around a little  that's a point of friction and the whole forms  Try to tighten your laces or try an insert,0NT
aww I really love all cats  I got mine from the shelter ones a small black and white named chimney and the other is a smokey  black  polydactyl  tiger ish boy named gremlin,0NT
Yes     Change them immediately  Happened to me as well  Someone took my keys then stole my car  Get your locks changed  ,0NT
Did you know the person or was it just some randomer  Is if possible it was a person you'd met before and just not remembered them ,0NT
I have my doubts  However if this is true best of luck to you  ,0NT
you guys are generalizing girls Not all girl go for looks Its about how you present yourself Example How you dress Confidence not to the point you become cocky  funny and this list can go on    ,0NT
You should put a disclaimer that this only applies to retards  Scared for a month  You are horribly  horribly retarded  ,0NT
Im a guy and I identify  with this so much but it must be even harder  as a girl since you're supposed to be the emotionally intelligent sex,0NT
Well Happy New Year  for what it's worth coming from a rando on the Internet  I hope you got those calls ,0NT
So if you're able to make friends and you actually have friends   what makes you FA in the first place ,0NT
Right  right  Still retarded  My girlfriend has an IUD   400 for 5 years  Or birth control pills  Or condoms  Figure it out ,0NT
if you really think so  then break up with your gf and stop having sex,0NT
antarctica   i hear land is suuuuper cheap down there ,0NT
Wow  that was hard to read  I'm sorry all of this happened to you   ,0NT
46 years old and never had a New Year's kiss ,0NT

She won't do either  Period  She needs to give her head a shake ,0NT
yes sir  that's generally how small claims are sorted upon the necessary task of removing shit from people,0NT
Nope These are things I did  and they worked for me You need to find what works for you ,0NT
If your partner isn't willing to work with you or if you can't trust them  why are you even with them ,0NT
I appreciate that  I posted in this sub to voice my raw frustration than to get answers  I expect nothing at all really  This is my equivalent of screaming in the middle of a mall food court or something  A letter to no one ,0NT
I don't have any offline friends currently  Poverty has completely fucked my ability to meet and relate to people ,0NT
I was joking  Normie like to think their success is the result of hard work  However when they are pressed for details of what they actually did they won't or can't explain it  ,0NT
That attitude is not going to help brochacho ,0NT
this is an incredible blessing  despite not having the NEED to work   you need to treat your life as a responsibility or else you will be miserable   find something that you love and work hard at it  lazy is universally hated ,0NT
Good ol humblebrag  Even on NYE lmao ,0NT
Why not  Sounds like you know how to do it ,0NT
Disclaimer  Fish Oil shown to be useless in cardiovascular health specifically  Study not broad enough to declare fish oil outright useless ,0NT
I know that feeling ,0NT
I'm guessing an FAer didn't need everything to be perfect to be in a relationship with someone haha  ,0NT
Same  brother  same,0NT
My boyfriend was 19 when I met him as well  Been together 3 years now  I was his first kiss and everything  Hope to be like you guys   And congrats on a long relationship    ,0NT
hard to move on isn't it though  they are all wishing me happy new year  but I'm not sure if they really mean it though,0NT
This is not your decison to make  And shame on your parents for putting that onto you   You need to tell your parents to be adults and make the decison themselves  Or is not yoir marriage  It is there's  ,0NT
Pick something for this moment ,0NT
I don't drink for the sake of not liking the feeling so completely understand   I also don't drink at all anymore because I want control of things and I'm 22 male who use to drink all the time ,0NT
I saw some polydactyl cats once down in Key West at Hemingway's house  They are so cool looking    I adopted the two kittens this year and are getting them used to being cuddled ,0NT
I'm financially crippled so there's not a lot of activities I can engage in  Anything beyond walking distance is too far and anything that isn't free is prohibitively expensive ,0NT
Sorry  I misunderstood  It is 7 am so did't really see the  normie ,0NT
I would look for one in Canada,0NT
Idk everyone seems to try to live to conform to others  I feel like I one is like me  ,0NT
Dude calm your shit  It was 5 years ago  You need to move on with your life and forget about it  Stop holding a grudge because you lost a fight  It happens    Move on ,0NT
Probably not a router problem  It's most likely your service is just shit either because your provider is boning you or your bandwidth is being chewed up by other people watching Netflix ,0NT
Some people do  some people don't  Maybe teens do more than most  I guess the older you are  the less you care if people judge you for being yourself ,0NT
Why it doesn't  I think it does  A good number of people probably overeat and don't exercise enough but I'm sure there are some people who have legitimate medical problems that caused weight issues ,0NT
Lol it's hard as fuck to become hercules esque so I doubt it's a issue getting abs however is hard but doable,0NT
I'm gonna take a shot in the dark and day you're maybe 14  You're severely overreacting  Maybe just unblock them and relax  Act like nothing happened  and it'll never get brought up again ,0NT
Then to be fair you weren't that socially awkward  If a guy who doesn't know you at all decides to talk to you it's understandable that you were short with him ,0NT
What medical problems  That is not true  I'm positive weight doesn't belong on this list  ,0NT
It's a lot of effort for the rest your life  It sucks but get used to it it's very important ,0NT
Bingo  You'll be fine  Learned a lesson in muting your mic when you're not using it lol,0NT

You don't have to be lonely at herpes only dot com,0NT
Haha yeah  More of a lesson in not taking things too seriously tho ,0NT
Wat do you mean  You acknowledge people don't play sports that much anymore  ,0NT
Maybe you could focus on yourself instead of comparing with others all the time  because that's the only thing you really have control over ,0NT
I was saying I'm surprised you play sports and can't find friends  Most of my closest friends were made this way ,0NT
I'm not one to usually say just walk away but this is a sketchy situation  She's playing games and being manipulative  these tendencies will only get worse as the relationship progresses  ,0NT
Stop visiting subs that condone sexslavery and rape then lol,0NT

My standards are pretty much not obese  overweight is fine pretty much everything is fine not that it matters,0NT

I mean there is one relatively easy way but yeah it's not supossed to be easy since suicide is rarely the right call even though it may seem thst way ,0NT
I'm glad everything got straightened out  I know you wish you could drop weight quicker  but that's not what it's about  It's about commitment and lifestyle change  I hope you can stick with it  someday all the guys will wish they were with you ,0NT
I would sincerely like to call you a douche nozzle with kindest regards for suggesting an abortion    Nah but forreal  put it up for adoption  she'll have a lot more mental psychological issues breakdowns with an abortion,0NT

It depends upon your field and your job prospects  You have to judge that for yourself because there may be many more opportunities in the US  despite the draw of your homeland  ,0NT
I didn't read all of that  I'll admit  I got broken up with 3 4 months ago  and its still really hard  But lord  I wish I had someone as afraid to lose me as you were of losing her  ,0NT

Yea but no one is aware of it  I want people everyone to be so scared to the point where even the closest of friends start screwing each other over in order to get higher ground,0NT
See a doctor  Anti depressants can really work for some people  It's taken me trying 7 different ones over the past 10 years but I think it's worth it  ,0NT
Yea I hate how people are born rich and with good genetics while others are cursed with a disability they couldn't avoid and live a poor life  I want everyone to suffer together and see what it feels like,0NT
It's a lose lose situation anyway you look at it    ,0NT
No for self promotion ,0NT
What'd u do  Make concrete ,0NT
I went through something similar  It sucks  But    Its not the kid's choices  We have no place and no say in our parents' marriages  Recognizing and accepting that is a step towards adulthood    Edit  wrong pronoun,0NT
I think that may be the real problem  we can't get passed our looks for ourselves in the first place ,0NT
Congrats mah dude  enjoy this feeling of happiness for the rest of your days ,0NT
Sorry you're gonna have to get better internet,0NT
Ya  it's not fair buddy  I completely agree with everything you said  I was born rich with good genetics  It's also not fair how you want people like me to suffer for things we couldn't avoid either ,0NT
Print one on your computer ,0NT
How old are you first it would help,0NT
Except it's not just you or other people born to succeed  it'll be everyone that suffers  Only way things will be fair  and people will finally feel what the less fortunate have felt all their lives ,0NT

That girl must be a psycho ,0NT
Then the shock will wear off,0NT
If they didn't tell you  they must care how you feel about it   Talk to them   Don't just throw away friendships like that ,0NT

Tell your wife how you feel and that her 30 yr old child is affecting your relationship with her  If she won't try to fix things maybe you should move on  Doesn't sound like you're getting what you need out of the relationship ,0NT

Or stress you out ,0NT
"I don't believe that  She is here for a reason and I don't think it is much easier for girls than it is for guys here  Lets not undermine her ""success story"" on this subreddit because of her gender  ",0NT

Can you elaborate on why you see this as bad advice   Do you hold a position of anti intellectualism ,0NT
She sounds amazing and brave  I bet she had the most interesting stories to tell  You should write them down  Ask around all who knew her for them  They would make a great book,0NT
I know I'm not normal I'm weird and that'll keep me alone forever I've written songs for girls but that won't do me any good ,0NT

Have you looked into the process for her to get a green card via marriage to you  I don't believe it is as simple as get married  get green card  live happily ever after ,0NT
You sound strong to me  Admitting you need help is a huge step  One step I'm still too afraid to make  It's scary  You've told your husband and he's there to support you  I hope you follow through with the referral  Hugs  ,0NT
You did the right thing by breaking up with him  He shows signs of possesivness which is never good in a relationship    And a man in his 30s should be mature enough to handle an argument without it getying out of hand ,0NT
Always welcome    ,0NT
I know  But it would seem like instead of trying to fix a forever alone  there is a different way to approach it  ,0NT

How is it easier for a girl to leave the house by herself than a guy to leave the house by himself  That makes no sense ,0NT
Look up the studies on heavy social media use and depression  I don't think that sort of thing can ever really alleviate loneliness in a lasting way ,0NT
Thank you I'm looking forward to getting help,0NT
A great idea would be to start going to a speaking club like toastmasters  They are cheap  available anywhere  and really low key  Sounding more intelligent really comes down to saying less and saying it with controlled timing ,0NT

All the girls I was interested in  roughly 14 so far I guess  were girls like this  But none of them have romantical interest in me   ,0NT

That may just be the bust of confidence I needed  ,0NT
Same here  Mid thirtysomething and it is not getting easier as time goes by     I feel like I missed out on so much  Never had the experience of teenage love so I feel in many ways my growth has been stunted ,0NT

Mine wasn't worth writing home about at that age    There's a  lot  of variation in time frame for development   But you're in the zone    ,0NT
Yep thats exactly what im feeling right now  I really wouldnt care if i got hit by a bus or a car or contract something in my body at least id die naturally instead of taking the easier way out ,0NT
I dunno why you're being down voted  The universe doesn't care about anyone  There is no god  Being deserving of something is not something that exists in nature  It's something people made up to comfort themselves ,0NT
So sorry for your loss   sending you a    hug    ,0NT
The point is that i can convince them that i dont have the time to meet people  especially since most women are either shallow or taken  ,0NT

     Well  at least you have a really good friend to love ,0NT
What's your relationships with this person  How often do you have to see them   It sounds like no answer will please this person ,0NT
Yeah I figured maybe that's what you meant but wasn't sure  What do you think it is about younger men that you prefer  I relate a lot to your last sentence as I stated in the OP also  ,0NT
Obviously not  because I'm not the most attractive guy  I'm pretty short and yet I've rarely been single and I'm happily engaged  It's not your looks  it's your mental state  ,0NT
"Why do girls always say ""oh I care about personality more than looks""  which is absolute bs  because the guy who's personality is fantastic will always be second best to another guy who's a few points better looking  ",0NT
You've rarely been single because your probably manly and at least decent looking  if I was girl all I would have to do is put makeup on and I'd be hot just like that ,0NT
They pretty much give me platitudes and then ignore everything else about me ,0NT
I didn't realize how many people actually sympathize with viewers of child pornography  Shame on you all   Report this to the police immediately  They may be able to track down the source of the images and rescue a child from exploitation and worse  ,0NT
Really strange motivation  like there's some underlying subconscious pull to avoid inflation in the dating market,0NT
Either you're a troll  or you need help with your mental state  Simple as that ,0NT
That made me feel all mushi inside  Thanks ,0NT
I think you're are assuming someone without confidence never tries     If they both try and 1 has some success while the other does not  guy with more success will have more confidence all other things being equal  ,0NT
There are entire websites dedicated to that pairing  if you're interested  I've actually seen plenty of Asian man Black woman couples in real life and online  there are quite a few YouTube couples  ,0NT
You're framing this situation like you either have to be sarcastic  or be quiet  Is it really so hard to be a genuine person that you would rather not say anything at all ,0NT
"The Liberals' definition of ""legitimate help""  includes the Murder of millions of babies each year among other things    See how that works ",0NT
Uhm  Mind to share what that would be  Hair on the back  Mole on the nose  Some things can be fixed  Some can't   ,0NT
Nothing wrong with finding a good teacher to help  It's well worth the time and money  And you'd be surprised how much it takes to get a lot of kids to swim  My main advice is keep going at it  don't give up ,0NT
Hi  I have updated the post with a small edit if this helps you to understand the situation even a little more clearly  Thank you for your input ,0NT
I'm pretty sure those thoughts will stay as thoughts as long as you know it's wrong  As for standing up  you just have to do it  There's no other way to put it  Fight for what you want and for what you believe in ,0NT
If you don't make it weird  it's not going to be weird  ,0NT
That's how I feel   ,0NT
I've read about this phenomenon on my IPHONE the other day ,0NT
I agree that you should go out  but maybe not to coffee  Try something less romantic ,0NT
Just older  By weeks  months  whatever  As long as they're between my age and legal I'm not fussy ,0NT
It just sucks that I'm working 50 70 hoe a week making ok money and can't buy a house  I'm kinda mad at the system and that the house market is so expensive ,0NT
Thanks  just didn't know if it was customary thing or not,0NT
You're very kind  thank you ,0NT
okay thanks m  i was hoping i could avoid that but it looks like i might just have to suck it up,0NT
I've waited for about 3 months now  she really loves me for some reason but I'm not sure I do yet ,0NT
Thanks so much  ,0NT
This is proof that medication does more harm than good ,0NT
Are you sure  What country ,0NT
Seriously  My mom and her husband can't even share a bedroom  She still looses sleep  I'm so very happy my man doesn't snore ,0NT
You don't need to kill to be safe  ,0NT
Your telling me that firm behind a screen  You know what  Fuck off  Your delusional like the other sket posting telling me girls don't have double standards ,0NT
Thank you so much for all you precious advice and your kindness Jim   I'll let you know if I get the part   ,0NT
It's not your fault  Please visit  r rape,0NT
There is difference bietween an advice and a lecture ,0NT
Your personality is ugly  your looks are not  You're so fucking backwards in your head  Stop worrying about girls or your looks  Worry about your mental health  because it's the ugliest thing about you ,0NT
It's not all about girls it's about life in general  Why do people complain about ugly people complaining  If you git treated like subhuman garbage because of the way you looked you would be bitter too,0NT
Love can take time  I'd say wait about another month ,0NT
This is true  I appreciate the input sir  ,0NT
Yeah   I just tried to laugh it off  But on the inside I was like please stop guys  ,0NT
Where are you talking to this guy that people just always get his attention ,0NT
"""Cultural Marxism"" isn't a thing   It's a silly term trying to blame SJWs on Marx  who was not a SJW man hater  ",0NT
Yeah  I'm the delusional one and yet I haven't made a post and ignored every sensible person  I guess everyone is wrong and you're always right  If you didn't want advice  why do you post ,0NT
Marijuana is not physically addictive and cannot cause those things  Do you maybe have the flu ,0NT
You got advice first and after ignoring everyone  treating people like shit  you're getting a lecture ,0NT
Maybe you cite it as et al  Then you can provide a link or scan to the publication  I'm sure this happens a lot to people  It's very easy to find out that you were published  ,0NT
True  but if presented no other option,0NT
End this non sustainable relationship and move on with your life  And  no  your edit doesn't change that advice ,0NT
"Well then deal with your life issues and see what happens  You get treated that way because of your mental issues  not your looks  No one just meets a person and goes  ""you're ugly"" that doesn't happen  ",0NT
This person keeps saying you're a bitch or grumpy  They are also the only person who says this to you   Any response you give only makes it worse and doesn't appease them   Are those correct ,0NT
Yes and I told you what you can do with your lecture    Are you form UK  ,0NT
Break a vocal chord    Grin    Jim b  ,0NT
Yeah exactly  Thanks for your replies ,0NT
Well you can deal with being rejected by everyone and be miserable if you choose not to listen    I am not ,0NT
Yeah  that's not how it works  Do you think you are mentally stable  You only seem to care about looks  you're all hung up on that  ,0NT
"Or you know  it's scripted  Have YOU ever had ""movie"" style conversations ",0NT
  I enjoy the bustling atmosphere with lots of people  it makes me more productive    It's FUCKING distracting  no  no  no FUCK  Oh good for you  ,0NT
My mum is oblivious to my FA'ness and just says I need to meet more women  Then I'll have plenty of interested girls according to her  Dad couldn't care less but from what I've gathered  he thinks I'm weird for being single ,0NT
Yeah sorry  I noticed it once I actually posted it lol  ,0NT
That's because looks is everything everything EVRYTHING  Iv lost out on so many job prospects etc to a guy less qualified be issue the girl interviewer doesn't want an ugly guy  true story ,0NT
Why isn't just hurting her him enough to get away to safety enough for you  Being so eager to kill isn't healthy,0NT
Maybe baking soda  Lush makes a foot powder  The bottle lasts for a long time    http   www lushusa com body foot care t for toes 03635 html   This stuff works wonders  ,0NT
99 99 percent of all people go their entire lifetime without ever having to kill someone in self defense ,0NT
Yeah  you're wrong buddy  And I don't believe your story  I think you make this stuff up to validate yourself  But do you think you are mentally stable  ,0NT
He's just a bad boy with a good heart  can't you see  ,0NT
They were gasping when they saw the cue on the screens facing towards them  Nonetheless are shows like this part of the brainwashing ,0NT
Haha I swear on my mothers grave I'm not making this up lol that's not even the half of ot ,0NT
Yeah I have no interest in ever dating I should just stay single forever ,0NT
You wanted advice and people  not just me  are telling you the same thing  it's not your looks  You have no idea what I look like  It's 100  your personality and mental state  I guarantee it  ,0NT
Thank you so much  I've been feeling pretty down lately  you've managed to cheer me up ,0NT
Even at my age fuck dating we all know how it ends,0NT
Where are you from  ,0NT
Be worried about places without good security  If anything this story shows you can't be too trusting because of impersonators  not because of doctors giving you the wrong diagnosis ,0NT
No I overheard them say it ,0NT
Drinking seems to be a problem for you   I'd look into AA and possibly take a break from your relationship  ,0NT
"Some little fat pudgy girl said to to another staff crossing my name out on the sheet ""nooo not him wev got enough ugly men around here"" ",0NT
Overheard them how  That makes no sense  You usually leave after an interviewer and if you stayed and creeped  that's pretty messed up    You're creating these lies to try and justify your insane behaviour and thoughts  Seek psychiatric help ,0NT
Anna and Rose are a holes  Plain and simple  Leave them in their toxic dumpster and find people who deserve your friendship   ,0NT
Do you think you are mentally stable ,0NT
If you don't trust you doctor and pharmacist  it's a good time to replace both  ,0NT
That's an illegal hiring practice in the U K   If that actually happened  you could successfully take legal action against them ,0NT
Yes more than enough  there's a rant In all of us,0NT
Why do you want to know   This is the second time you've asked me that ,0NT
I never really pay much attention to politics so thanks for informing me about that,0NT
It's my word against there's ,0NT
I would definetly not be interested in getting into a conversation with some random man or woman on the street  I have better things to do and they should too ,0NT
Who cares  Masturbate  I do it multiple times a day every day  My brain works great  I'm not fat  I'm not depressed even tho I have things that should depressed me  Your're the only one limiting yourself ,0NT
There was a group of us there   I went to the toilet down a little corridor and on my way back I heard her say it after the other staff said my name asking her before she crossed my name out ,0NT
d20   20 sided die You roll to see if you accomplish a task  It's a D D reference ,0NT
Sounds like you're in a dissociative state  My advice  find a therapist and get medicated  Both saved my life ,0NT
MASTURBATE FOREVER IF IT MAKES YOU HAPPY ,0NT
You say you want to kill yourself  and have tried before  You really    REEEEALLY think that mentally stable people want to kill themselves  ,0NT
Your whole story makes no sense   Why would they have even said that in front of you   Why would you even be present when they were crossing names off the list   That's highly unusual ,0NT
A sane and reasonable person who knows your mentally unstable ,0NT
 Works every time  http   i1 kym cdn com entries icons original 000 014 711 1380697092809 jpg ,0NT
Why does it matter though   Why did you only ask me this question and none of the other commenters ,0NT
Dude  I'm not some bloodthirsty maniac  If someone broke into your house with a gun  it's either you or him  If he's some amateur robber that's unarmed of course I'm not going to kill him ,0NT
Yeah  that didn't happen  Why are you asking for advice if you're going to be rude and not listen ,0NT
I'm well aware  this is just a what if scenario,0NT
It sounds like her lawyer has grounds to sue for libel  Also  video surveillance may lead to criminal charges for trespass  property damage and theft  It seems to me that these protesters are flirting with criminal records and jail time ,0NT
You seem to have a drinking problem and I don't understand why you're making yourself out to be the victim in this situation  Be happy you're not facing domestic violence charges and work on healing yourself ,0NT
The alternative is for people to wonder if you might be incel which is one of the lowest status positions in our society   ,0NT
Yep  Okay  now I know you're trolling  ,0NT
Keep the lawyer  and consider getting a restraining order against these girls   ,0NT
Lol this world is such a fucking joke,0NT
  La Libertas  is being redefined  now on death the government has a presumption of ownership of your body   This is a slippery slope and a  prcdent terrible  ,0NT
Good point  I might be reaching the end with this one  Been wasting a lot of time  Appointment next Monday  Good luck to me,0NT
I know where the other guys form  Jim not asking for city street and door number just the country  UK or US  I'm form the UK  See lol,0NT
It sounded like you're whining about not being able to kill    ,0NT
I swear to god I'm not  I do watch Isis videos a lot  and I wouldn't say no to being accepted by them  On my mothers grave I'm not lying or trolling  ,0NT
Rarely  but enough that I can see why they're written like they are  Sometimes you're on point and say the most clever things  And some people are much better at it than others ,0NT
You need to pull out the big guns here  I'm sure she would appreciate the gesture if you took her out    glad you're ok OP  sounds like you've got a great girl there  Hope it all works out ,0NT
Do not make posts like anymore  especially if you're not going to participate after you make it  Only warning ,0NT
You not going to answer  Just want to know are you British or American or anything else  Because it's different to what we've been talking about in other countries ,0NT
If that's how you truly feel  I hope you do die then so that you don't do anything stupid to others  No wonder nobody likes you  ,0NT
I was alone during university  I got through it by spending my time studying and finding an internship  ,0NT
"And well I sorta saw it as a sorta symbiotic thing like you help me and I try to help you get your life on track getting you to college and improving how you feel and maybe working out ur ""dipping"" stuff",0NT
Dear lord  What kind of stuff have you tried  online  in bars clubs  I can't believe this is real  I refuse to  I don't want to ,0NT
God no  the last thing I want is blood on my hands  just shooting someone would be scarring enough for my conscience  I might accidentally kill them if I shoot so are there any other options besides running and hiding ,0NT
He is a piece of shit for real  Yet  I know who he was before and I feel like I don't think he will change unless he gets help  which he won't seek ,0NT
Thanks  learned something new today,0NT
 Have a good life with your at least adequate looks  OP  you also have adequate looks   Your looks are not the problem ,0NT
"If you were just overhearing them  how did you know the speaker was ""a fat little pudgy girl ""  Your story is full of holes",0NT
"This  I understand you love him OP but clearly he's not the person you thought he was  You are in love with a lie    Something to ask yourself is ""Am I willing to go to jail for a lie """,0NT
Are you from us or uk  Can I please know  ,0NT
I'm conflicted myself with the issue of weed like I think it could get rid of my anxiety stress of Depression but that I shouldn't because it might mess me up and make me stupid,0NT
The speaker was the girl who Interviewed me  ,0NT
He reminds me of Negan from The Walking Dead ,0NT
I admire and thank you for your honesty   I'll surely consider it   However  we never really know what will happen do we   We don't know if a situation like this will ever arise again   But again  thank you ,0NT
You're very welcome  I'm sorry you were feeling down lately  but I'm glad you were able to be cheered up  even just a little ,0NT
Role playing probably people try to make it interesting that way,0NT
It still is your decision  Are you illiterate ,0NT
Ok  People have different boundaries  Just because your willing to do something doesn't mean she has to be too  Maybe she's done something similar in the past and got burned so she doesn't do it any more ,0NT
Why not just keep everything else the same  but stop smoking  When you throw everything in the air  why would you be surprised if you felt differently  A lot of healthy food can be not so gentle on the GI tract  ,0NT
I would feel awkward doing that  It also leads to people making fun of you  I've seen examples with other people trying that out  It sucks ,0NT
Do you two have a really blunt way of communication   If this is a recent thing that he's been doing  has he been under any stress  Changes in behaviour   Has he ever told you this in front of other people  ,0NT
I want this every day  The return of those words is so lovely and fulfilling  ,0NT

I can't talk to people and be interesting  Be normie  make people be friends with me etc  How is that too simple ,0NT
Yes  Get lots of rest  drink lots of fluids  and wait about a week  ,0NT
I'm undecided and have no interests besides playing video games  Friends don't just happen for people like me ,0NT
I have seen schizophrenic and psychotic bipolar pts on as many as 14  ,0NT
Nobody on such shows can ever be described as a 'normie' ,0NT
People generally assume I'm content because that's what I show them  ,0NT
Yeah now that I think of it pepper spray is pretty good or a taser  do you by any chance know if stun guns or rubber bullets are allowed in civilian use ,0NT

And I'm sure there are exactly as many saying 'me and my mom' or 'me and my sister' or 'me and my friend'  you just notice the girlfriend ones more because you ain't got one ,0NT
Sad that you get downvoted for having preferences ,0NT
Edit wasn't looking to alter advice  I was just trying to be as clear as I can be  Thank you for your advice ,0NT

this comment made me and my girlfriend laugh a lot,0NT
I am into some instrumental   This  https   www youtube com watch v U gRg piz M  is one of my favourite tracks  Besides that  some rap too  Childish Gambino and Kendrick Lamar are pretty awesome ,0NT
I don't think so but I have no idea    in my country you get away with raping because you attended to the trial in a suit and the woman you raped was wearing a dress when you raped her   ,0NT
I should wear more clothes with sheep oil in them  What does that even mean  ,0NT
You are sadistic toward yourself and toward your wife  I am unaffected do not fray ,0NT
Alright  I don't know how serious you are being but thanks anyways,0NT
Damn what a f ed up world we live in  thanks for the input though  appreciate it,0NT
They have cue cards and people letting them know when to clap and make noises   Source  mother went to see it  ,0NT

They have cue cards and people letting them know when to clap and make noises   Source  mother went to see it  ,0NT
If there's more than one writer  there's going to be collaboration  No way around it  If you want your story to be untainted you need to work alone ,0NT
video game and anime soundtracks mostly ,0NT
Thank you for sharing  I guess you are right  So try focusing on one thing first  ,0NT
It definitely wasn't drugs  we only had people round that we new well personally and trusted  Must've been an unexplainable reaction to alcohol like you said ,0NT
I know sometimes it feels like it damages ur morality makes you feel bad but if you try to improve yourself while still doing that it keeps you happy until you can one day be happy enough to stop doing it and be happy on your own,0NT
I'm glad if I could show you other ways to protect yourslef than killing   ,0NT
I've always found older women incredibly alluring  Not sure why  Maybe it has something to do with me being a submissive little bitch ,0NT
Great  Even a criminal is seen as a better partner than me ,0NT
I don't fuckin know  You want me to look at my conversations with a microscope and determine scientifically the keywords and phrases I am missing  I don't think that's how you learn ,0NT
Sadistic  I'd ask you to explain but I'm still trying to figure out what sheep oil is  You say things that don't make sense  You also assume my partner is female  I will not fray  Whatever that means  ,0NT
There are definitely way more references to girlfriends and SO's on reddit than other family members or friends  ,0NT
"""omg guys look at my girlfriend she did this cool thing isn't she amazing   hey did i mention i have a girlfriend  ""    Basically every mainstream reddit thread  ",0NT
Your partner might have neurological issues  Have they ever been tested ,0NT
You're the one who created sheep oil ,0NT
I'm kind of lost  Keep doing until I reach a point where I'm emotionally healthy enough to quit ,0NT
Thank you for the warm and friendly wishes of caring support  It really does me so much to hear these things ,0NT
I prefer music that doesn't distract me from my thoughts  Video game soundtracks  smooth instrumental jazz  and classical music make up the lion's share of my music player ,0NT
While I obviously don't know the details of your situation  you sound like a good friend  You helped this person as best you could for a child so young  and I admire you for that  ,0NT
my brain has adapted to this  must be 5 years now already since then  It's like  i can't long and wish for something that doesn't exist  amiright  Helps rarely seeing a girl in real life too  feelsgoodbeingimmuneman,0NT

Damn that's not going to be possible for a couple months at least  oh well thanks for your time,0NT
I like a lot of different stuff   Rock  alternative rock  metal  pop  sophisti pop   As I saw your post  I was listening to  Meltdown by Ash  https   www youtube com watch v yrx1b4gaxWs list PL696E82824A2D5388  ,0NT
They have not  Hearing and memory tests were passed with flying colors  ,0NT

hey that's my rock you're crawling into,0NT
I never said I was going to stay in my room all day  I just don't have much faith in my abilities to make friends when they haven't worked my whole life ,0NT
I don't know if you should either   Could that account be really old and untouched for years ,0NT
The decision was made by the government that it is  by default  their corpse   It should be opt in   Are you illiterate that you couldn't figure that out from these comments   ,0NT
 what was wrong with me   why was nobody else the same   Hell wasn't made big for just holding one person in,0NT
You need to report this  I know you love him  but this is bigger than you and it's bigger than him  Allowing this kind of habit to perpetuate puts children in danger  They matter more ,0NT
She has tried them but they just provide medication which she is against   ,0NT
You can't be serious  ,0NT
Ah that makes a difference    It's proper etiquette to suspend judgment towards getting slapped by someone's death spasms until said spasms have subsided   ,0NT
They should be able to refer to counseling  usually  Too bad she won't agree to tryanorher mediation if she didn't like the one she tried ,0NT
Many genres of rock  metal  rap  electronic  classical   Anything that helps me get through the day,0NT
He was on yesterday  Says at the bottom ,0NT
Alright  I just thought that quitting would improve my mood  But  evidently  it really hasn't  Thank you for your response  Guess I'll try therapy and give exercise another go  ,0NT
Regardless of whether or not he took the photos it's wrong and children are still being abused  There's a reason even the hardest of criminals have zero sympathy for pedophiles  ,0NT
" To make you feel even better  here's a taste of what they meant by ""went viral""   http   imgur com lLubOs9 ",0NT
Maybe I'm looking at it incorrectly but from my point of view right now I think she doesnt think these counselling sessions are helping so she just doesnt go to them    she tends to give up very easily  on everything now  ,0NT
Not if you actually have problems remembering  If you're just a slow learner you'll get there eventually  ,0NT
Just focus on improving things one at a time until you're ready to begin quitting I'm trying the same,0NT
I used to wonder what kind of weirdos did that  Now I totally get it  they do it to  stay married   A good night's sleep is just too important ,0NT

So that's what Godwin's Law looks like  Neat ,0NT
Does he feel secure in his own masculinity  Sounds like a little bit of Walter White syndrome mixed with feelings of inferiority  As dumb as it may sound  teaching isn't always seen as a masculine profession  Do you make more money than him ,0NT
Because they stay inside and are bad at socializing and meeting other people   It's by no means impossible or even hard  But probably harder than usual to become friends with them because of the things I mentioned before ,0NT
We exist but in the real world we are few and far between   The only reason it seems like there are a lot of us is because we flock to this sub ,0NT
n m I forgot you guys are still in school  ,0NT
 What is done with it should be MY decision   It still is  that's why your getting downvoted and insulted so much  You're intentionally being an idiot ,0NT
"Wow  so your advice is to not even prep them   I mean  they probably know  but what if they don't    My advice is to casually say ""you know I'm gay  right   I want to bring someone over""  ",0NT

Not being able to have kids sounds appealing to people who can't be bothered with children and not being a supermodel means you wouldn't be jetting off all over the world ,0NT

That guy doesn't even look that attractive to me  I'm really puzzled by his case  But good for him I guess ,0NT
I'm assuming he's not listed on your birth certificate      Could you ask any aunts or uncles  your brothers dad  or any old friends of your moms ,0NT

Sounds like something you should report to be honest  I don't know why you wouldn't  He's an adult and is responsible for his actions  ,0NT
Well you still have time to improve,0NT
Thank you so much  Happy new year to you as well ,0NT

Libel and damages    If this lawyer isn't willing to pursue  seek another  This case has many indications of being an easy victory ,0NT

Maybe move my weights into the shower too,0NT
Thanks  that's pretty solid advice to be honest  and I'm sure even though I can be a little awkward I could pull off saying that to them and making it sound natural   ,0NT
The new year's post really dragged in all the normie trash from  r all ,0NT
Nah  fuck you  Also  your opinion is shit  That's my opinion  Problem  kid ,0NT
I do feel unloveable whenever I see a couple holding hands walking together kissing,0NT
You've lived together two years and this behaviour started in the past two years   Maybe something about living together is annoying him ,0NT
Great  thanks for your input  As long as the name doesn't sound ridiculous without my having realized it haha,0NT
Does it really feel good being single for so long ,0NT
I know it's not  ,0NT
That's what I'm maybe thinking  I think it was my fault for even feeding into it  I think I said some stuff which made him feel insulted and this is his way of getting back  ,0NT
Yes   We don't allow any relationship dating sex advice in this sub  So this is your official warning ,0NT
Hmm I see where you're coming from  and maybe I should prep them   I'm just worried saying something like that might steer the conversation into talking about my sexuality  rather than talking about my partner,0NT
Bro I'm black and almost every black chick I know love Asian men just go for it ,0NT
Congratulations  Seems like it was a great way to end 2016 ,0NT

I'm thinking about just sending the link to his profile so she can have at it herself  I'll have to check if non users can see it though ,0NT
Is the feeling that I am enabling them  and about the dollars  it's not a big amount  but they could asked me first  now I feel like I cannot leave nothing valuable  ,0NT
why in the world would you feel guilty ,0NT
Restraining orders  no contact order etc  They will clearly break the order and then get punished criminally  ,0NT
If shes completely addicted and wants to stop  she needs to go to inpatient detox and rehab  Her environment isnt changing at home so why would she  Something has to give and its better its her toxic environment than her life ,0NT
You had me until you said traditional relationship where you stay at home   What is the point of staying home if you don't have kids  That just seems like laziness to me ,0NT
Lol  this is stupid ,0NT

She didn't  Shit just started falling apart  And still falling apart  I killed everything that could make this year something good  ,0NT
Well it seems like something needs to be done about it  Seems like it would've escalated to full on rape if that dude didn't intervene  Won't the court appoint a lawyer if you can't afford one ,0NT
It's never too late to reinvent yourself  What is the worst that could happen  They don't like the real you  How does that hurt you  Why do they have to like you ,0NT
     ,0NT
Do it  I'm not sure where you are  but changing your Name in the UK is so easy  With how backwards we generally are law wise  I'd imagine its even easier elsewhere  Good luck ,0NT
Well most of the people I'm around I see a lot   ,0NT
Cheers dude  I think I probably will mention it to her  yeah mdma makes people very lovey dovey ,0NT
I can't really speak for everybody  but I find bald men extremely attractive  And 5 foot 6 doesn't really matter either   Those who matter don't mind  those who mind don't matter  ,0NT
Hahaahah  Face my anxieties,0NT
Congrats on a job well done  OP ,0NT
So you would probably have no problem with a child molester living next to you and your kids if he's good looking  right  Anyone who has a problem with that must be a jelly hater  right ,0NT
You can't please everyone in life  There will be people who will judge you and not like you no matter how much a mask you wear  It's a lot less stressful to just be you and not try to compartmentalize your personality so much  ,0NT
Do you at least collect disability or something ,0NT
She's just shallow as fuck  Sex is not everything you'll find someone,0NT
"Yeah  It's just hard to ""reinvent"" myself  I guess ",0NT

Complete the course  Think long term  The benefits outweigh the costs ,0NT
Well that's unfortunate  I'm sorry about your situation  But someone who doesn't contribute at all is basically a no starter for someone like me who doesn't make much money in the first place  Maybe you'll find your sugar daddy somewhere ,0NT
I too think of possible conversions  But more often than not when I have something interesting or cool to say in a certain moment  that subject never comes up or the moment never arises  ,0NT
Girlfriends are only a good thing if your hot  otherwise they'll probably cheat on you  ,0NT
Yeah if they did take it they were taking advantage of your generosity of allowing them into your home  I totally understand not wanting to enable them  Some people will just keep taking and you have to cut them off ,0NT
I guess that would make sense looking at my childhood ,0NT
Very true  And sadly I'm sure he would get put on the registry  I say sadly because he never physically touched children  If you piss in public you could be slapped on the registry so ,0NT
"Depends on how old you   your ""girlfriend"" are ",0NT
I guess you would just delete that reminder post ,0NT
Because consent is assumed until you make an active declaration ,0NT
It's a comment under someone's post   ,0NT
Sweet thanks  I thought I just needed someone else to look at it,0NT
Jesus that's tough  I'd grab evidence  pictures of the wall and the bruises on your girlfriend  and take it to the chief of police  With consent from your girlfriend  she might have to be there as well ,0NT
Et al with a link sounds good  making sure to use the first author and et al  It gives due credit to all  without changing orders of authorship  ,0NT
yep  even for streaking or peeing in public the side of the road  ,0NT
Heh  This sounds a little like my relationship  Heh  Heh  O O,0NT
Just break up with him  let him see what he's missing  I'll bet those feelings suddenly come back again  and if not  so what  Plenty more  eh ,0NT
Yeah  You lay on your back  if you have a life vest it's easier for balance  and just curl to legs up ,0NT
I am so sorry for your loss    I am certain he knew how much he meant to you  and that he felt appreciated in your relationship   Be kind to yourself  ,0NT
What  In  The  Actual  Fuck ,0NT
So if women aren't people are they aliens ,0NT
That's DEFINITELY the reason why you're being downvoted  Don't you know everyone here is a raging misogynist who hates women ,0NT
Has anyone asked what your grandma wants  Is she fully aware of what is happening in this situation ,0NT

You should watch  the documentary  you will change your mind,0NT
All hangouts are always both  if you end up together it was the romantic first date  if you don't it was hanging out with friends   Romance is something in hindsight so go in with the mindset as hanging out ,0NT
Virginity is a stupid concept anyways  PIV intercourse doesn't have to equate to sex  Sex is more than just that    Do you feel happy with your decision ,0NT
You either keep her as a fwb or risk it and ask her out  It's all on you ,0NT
Well Costa Rica is amazing  It has everything like volcanos  hot springs  rain forests  cloud forests  Atlantic beaches  Pacific beaches  caves  rivers  valleys mountains  fauna  flora  It takes a good while to see it all ,0NT
Depends where he lives  If it's a small town  chief and him might be buddy buddy and fuck over op ,0NT
As many have said get him to the vet  If he has recently had surgery there's a good chance it's related however it may not be ,0NT
search for websites that review local prostitutes  and see if they have non pros sections  or dig through the pages,0NT
Yet  a man has to contribute money  or else he's utterly worthless   Quite the double standard ,0NT
Agreed   Any advice solely hinges on this information ,0NT
Dude  I really appreciate this post  You perfectly worded my own thoughts and struggles ,0NT
Unfortunately FWB usually one of you starts feeling this way  As the previous comment said  you gamble or you don't  ,0NT
"You could say something not so direct about it like  ""How have things been going without your Mom around """,0NT
Thanks  This mindset is probably what led me to be so much more successful making friends this time around  ,0NT
"I had made food for her because usually she says she doesn't want to eat but then sees me eating and wants some  I made food for her and then said ""that's stupid"" annoyed when she said she wasn't going to eat it  ",0NT

Keep it that way I would say don't say it or show any sign of it ,0NT
Sounds like your friend was r raisedbynarcissists and is experiencing depression  Encourage him to take the advice you'll find in the subreddit I included and seek out a new therapist better suited to his situation ,0NT
A Christmas Carol is my second favourite book  after The Hunchback of Notre Dame  because I can relate to how bitter and twisted he was after years of loneliness  Too bad I will never have the opportunity to change like he did ,0NT
Thanks  it sucks how people make assumptions before they get to know you  ,0NT
Thanks for the advice  Here in the US  it seems to be a simple matter of taking the issue to a Superior Court  where they judge the reasoning behind the name change ,0NT
My parents gave up on me in my teenage years  They knew I would never find friends or a girlfriend and would never give them a grandchild ,0NT
I'm not against abortion  it's just something I'm not willing to do to myself  I could never live it down and I'd never forgive myself ,0NT

"Actually normie is a pretty chill word  It's the ones who use the word  ""cuck"" unironically that makes me cringe ",0NT
Life is a joke  my friend ,0NT
Thanks for that  I think I'll play some football and maybe go to some smash tournaments  I just am so tired of this life I'm stuck living at the moment  I wish I could just skip time forward 6 months  ,0NT
It's not a normal thing to occur  Man a people sleep on their backs ,0NT
Are flowers a good idea  They're very cliche and I'm not sure how she'd feel about it ,0NT
I had sleep paralasys 3 times and i always slept on my side so I think its not about sleeping on your back ,0NT

that is the saddest part,0NT
agreeing to pay for it opens the way to her asking for more and more bullshit  If she is upset by that then she is probably not the kind of friend you want in your life,0NT
The only thing worse than living in misery is dying in it  Stay alive  enjoy gore and murder  and show your middle fingers to the void  ,0NT

Well  it was of his own doing  He was engaged but not for love  he wanted the woman's dowry  The woman realized this and confronted Scrooge  He stated that he loved money more than her  ,0NT
The only one who needs help here is you  Pedophile apologists and rape apologists run rampant in this sub  Actions have consequences  and consuming material is the first step to producing your own  That gap CANNOT be bridged  It needs to stop NOW ,0NT
I know just how this feels  Terrifyingly wonderful  Wonderfully terrifying  But mostly the scary part  They're so worth it  insecurities be damned ,0NT
I gave advice  You don't have to take it  Do as you please ,0NT
Make sure they're not tge only pair you ever wear   They should get completely dry between wearing them  ideally you switch between different pairs of shoes ,0NT
My SO's snoring makes me sleepy  so when he starts snoring it does the opposite and puts me to sleep,0NT

And  of course  no protection is foolproof  And birth control is the responsibility of both partners  As is the result if it fails ,0NT
You are correct  she made sure to leave him off  I think my Aunty knew him  but she's of that same mentality  that I'm selfish and that my Mother should be enough for me  and won't discuss it with me  ,0NT
Currently listen to Flumes album skin a lot  I love it  It's simply beutifull ,0NT
You never answered my other question   What do you think I should take the blame for ,0NT

Thank you so much  That makes a lot of sense now that you say these things  I guess I'll keep on going ,0NT
Nah fam you good as long as that isn't your everyday clothe  But face wise you're quiet good looking ,0NT
You made it clear you don't have any intention to apologize  so there's no reason to answer the question  That not asking for advice  It's being bitter  Just let it go and go about your day ,0NT
I know  that's not what I meant at all  He has autism ,0NT
no problem  but just to be certain because i don't want to let you leave still thinking about suicide  did you reach out to people  or talk to a therapist or doctor    Have a great day ,0NT
You're welcome  Please don't do anything dangerous   3,0NT

The link is broken      And that sounds like a good idea  but I don't have any activity on this account so it might seem sketchy  This is a throwaway account since he knows my actual one  ,0NT

You mentioned drug issues so I was wondering  Has he gotten help  ,0NT
It wouldn't help the fact that I was a 25 year old kissless virgin still  That I was craving that affection  It'd just mean there were tons of other people like me  which seems kinda sad  I wouldn't wish this on anyone ,0NT
You'll meet interesting people when working  boring jobs  The advice I would give to you would be to look at improving your social skills as it can take you places and don't worry much about what job ,0NT
Good to know  thanks ,0NT
She is diagnosed  yes  but her parents are only willing to read about the issue  finding things that only benefit their argument  dismissing all the claims about how serious this kind of stuff is  Her parents are a bit arrogant about their own knowledge ,0NT
Couldn't have said it better  Having expectations from anyone about anything can only lead to disappointments  ,0NT

I'm 100  sure  He's the only partner I've had  So yeah  shitty question indeed ,0NT
That has got to be extra hard for you since he was young and it was sudden   My dad was very ill and had been dying for a long time  and was 75  and we all began grieving years ago   ,0NT

My sister has IBS I think  I'm sure there are recipes out there that vary a good mixture of foods that you can eat e g a low fodmap fish curry with soothing spices   The IBS network helps a bunch with food ,0NT
Forgot they did that too    Turkey  ,0NT
There's really no question to this  you have to tell him that you're pregnant  It's his child too  he's obligated to know he's having a child just as you are too  It wouldn't be fair for you or him  ,0NT
Hopefully  Good luck out there ,0NT
that's what i'm currently working on doing,0NT

Female here  and yes  my thoughts are just as sick and twisted  They have been that way since I could think  And it's only about men guys facing torture rape    Any book suggestions  btw ,0NT
I definitely understand how you feel  I've been in similar situations  The only thing is that someone who cares about your feelings wouldn't call you out the way he did over having doubts  ,0NT
Man this makes me so angry  They're not only endangering themselves but others too,0NT
Like I said  it probably only appeals to weirdos like me ,0NT
You should get them a sleep study  If it's sleep apnea it'll help both of you sleep much better and possibly prolong both of your lives,0NT
Ooooh yeah that'd make me mad too  Tell them that what they do with the characters on their own time is their business  but you need to get what you paid for ,0NT
yeah  they live across the street  me and her and her brothers and sisters were all close before my health went south years ago  my social life fell apart after that  ,0NT
If you're not good enough for anyone  there will always be someone not good enough for you    and when you meet them  you can either become their mate or motivate yourself to become a better person ,0NT

Well  you can't starve to death  Although my sister  does  just live of popcorn and marhsmellows  I think spending more money on new and interesting things is better than not having anything at all and live of snacks  Sorry I'm unable to help ,0NT

I just don't understand how thinking confidentally translates into dates  As long as I smile  make eye contact  not say anything very negative  and not slouch over   people have no idea that I'm bitter and I hate being single ,0NT
"I guess I should consider myself ""lucky"" that none of the people getting married will think about me when inviting people ",0NT

I'm in same shape lately  Just fapping  reading  binge eating   ignoring my hobbies  It's definitely depression caused from lack of romantic sexual interest in me ,0NT
One group that many didn't list is Fozzey   VanC  They speak to the FA within me  I like music that is sad and depressing because it comes from the heart  and every word sung or rapped is real  ,0NT
It doesn't  Only actions  body language  and words can be portrayed to others  Your thoughts inside your head cannot exactly be seen ,0NT

heres a solution  make him watch animals get ripped apart by other animals on youtube  and ask him if he would rather they die painlessly and eaten by humans instea fo being ripped to shreds by other animals ,0NT

Long is subjective to the eyes watching  It's mostly what she believed was long  Your next gf will probably understand that  If I may ask  why did she give you a reward ,0NT
Have you considered telling his parents that its your weed and he didnt know about it ,0NT
I know this all too well  standard advice is seeking help but in the meantime maybe try small goals or changes each day  It's so helpful when all you notice is your body and it's functions  ,0NT

" Nobody likes ugly girls   Women get a choice of sex and dates with men despite being ugly  Some of which are more attractive than them  This ""women can be FA incel"" meme needs to stop",0NT
Damn  so high tech  Call me old fashioned  but I just defecate on the floor ,0NT
Thank you so much for your kind words  ,0NT
Maybe God just jumped in and helped you out  Sometimes our feelings get in the way of logic  ,0NT
It's all how you use it  If you act timid about it and shy she'll pick up on that  If you put it down like you have a monster in your pants it'll affirm what she has heard ,0NT
Hobbies or activities that have women in them ,0NT

Tell your mother because she will find out eventually ,0NT

  I've given up on relationships  I just want to be happy with my life as it is  If only that were possible,0NT
No going back now  you're in for quite the poop in a couple hours tho,0NT
I have worried about this  If you google his name  the sex offender registry is literally the first result  If she finds out on her own  I feel like that would be worse than being told by her family  But I don't know ,0NT
Ugly easily    Short guys can be fine  there is a certain Hobbit like novelty in it  Being awkward can be fixed with time and practice  Being ugly is much tougher and more expensive to fix,0NT
I knew those were rookie numbers   I'll jerk off twice as much for my New Year's Resolution   Thank you   u FA AnimeNerd ,0NT
Well worded and well thought out    Thank you so so much    I went through your history and noted that you tend to help others as well  You deserve this and I hope that everything in your life is going well  ,0NT
You DO know man  it is obvious that it is better for you and your dad or just you to tell her rather than her find out on the web  She deserves to know ASAP there is literally no reason to hide this from her,0NT
Just ask if she still wants time to think she will say so  but if she goes with maybe it will help her figure it out ,0NT
The Snoop Dogg  Pitbull concert on FOX was pretty good  though ,0NT
Fair enough  I must've been self projecting stuff,0NT
Agreed as well  No harm in asking ,0NT
See if they will agree to your fostering a dog as a trial period  If everything goes well  once the foster is adopted  you get your own dog  Or perhaps you end up adopting the foster yourself ,0NT
Apparently it is possible  because otherwise  how could you be happy without a relationship  And if you aren't happy alone  you won't be able to be in a good relationship ,0NT

Unsure what country you are in so laws can be different  but in my opinion she is too young and as much as it might hurt you  you need to forget about it ,0NT
I'm sorry but the link to the video seems broken  is there a mirror ,0NT
She's overreacting  It's a fucking emoji  Even I could tell you weren't being serious since no one should take emojis serious  You do you,0NT
 There's this  https   en m wikipedia org wiki Ages of consent in North America Mexico   But yeah  that is the most reasonable approach  And again  that's not necessarily all I'm looking for ,0NT
Fuck no  Never do this again ,0NT
Then I guess that's something you're just going to have to deal with  Because if you're going on a date with someone and you haven't told them ahead of time then you just want casual sex and they're suddenly surprised  some communication has not been fully read ,0NT
I must have missed a letter when copying  i've edited the link,0NT
It's a faux pas  but frankly  I think if you're on this sub  the value of a relationship that actually worked with a coworker would outweigh the problems ,0NT
Idk but that sucks ,0NT

She felt like she wasted my time because we never did anything beyond kissing  I think  So she spread the word,0NT

Yo  I'm sorry to see you in a bad situation with whatever you're going through  I can't promise anything  but I can guarantee that if you need a friend  dm me and we can chat a bit  and each be supportive ,0NT

No  you're probably right  Life is super tough for attractive men  They really have it hard  I'm so sad for them ,0NT

Conversely  would you really want to be with someone who would reject you over something like that  I think it's better to be honest  if they can't deal with that  then move on ,0NT

Maybe seek help  Therapist ,0NT
For what it's worth  I'm sorry for your loss      They have therapist for people who recently had some one pass  It's not scary as people make it out to be  I promise ,0NT
Wait so you're 17 and he's atleast 19  that could end up being odd  Also  nothing wrong with not wanting to date special people if you just can't connect with them ,0NT

Most of them yes  I have crappy ones facing and not facing the camera ,0NT
