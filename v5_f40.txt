I definitely have  I think back to when I was a kid and using the urinal  When I was a kid I'd just whip that shit out and start pissin  it didn't matter if there were 40 other dudes in there  it'd  flow like water  Nowadays I have to do breathing exercises to calm myself down if there is anyone in the bathroom   Same experiences  Same situation  my friend  Never experienced a romantic relationship with a girl  Now here at age 18  I have severe anxiety and it's hard to get out of my comfort zone but I know that comfort isn't right for me  That's the truth for people who have anxiety depression  By all means  you  myself in included  need to escape and find those who will let us in their lives  You may not know how to love yourself but remember that you know how to love others  JK Rowling made a very nice Christmas tweet that really helped me   In part it reads  "Ive also heard from people who are going through very tough times  These always seem worse at Christmas   At this time of year  were bombarded with images of perfect lives  which bear as little relation to reality as tinsel does to gold   If youre lucky enough to be with the people you love  warm and safe  with enough to eat  Im sure you feel as blessed as I do   But if your life is currently full of difficulties  if you arent where you want to be  either literally or figuratively  remember that extraordinary transformations are possible  Everything changes  Nothing is forever   Thinking back to my worst Christmas  I found it hard to believe that my unhappiness would pass  I was truly afraid of the future   You never know what the future holds  Astonishing reversals of fortune happen every minute   So if youre sad  or lonely  or bereaved  or ill  separated from your loved ones or in any other way suffering this Christmas  I send you love and wish you luck and better times  Millions of us have been where you are now   Remember  Christmas Day is  in the end  just a day  It isnt a test or a scorecard of you or your life  so be kind to yourself "  That last one is really the heart of it all   To reiterate to today  New Years Eve is  in the end  just a day  It isnt a test or a scorecard of you or your life  so be kind to yourself   I spent many many years doing nothing  making false promises  and seeing nothing come of them   Even today it's really easy to get stuck in a mire of "I'm still overweight  I don't have a girlfriend  this year was wasted" but it's very hard to pause and go "I started gaming with friends every week  I started some D D with reddit strangers that goes every week  I took 3 trips for myself  I spent a lot of money just on myself to make me happy"   I guarantee you that there's a lot you did for yourself this year to take heart in outside of the two big goals of being fit and getting a girlfriend  You cant save her  She is also already in an relationship  Even if she does get away  its best to be in therapy for at least a year before beginning another relationship  She has to save herself  No one is coming to do it for her  She had an opportunity to have him removed when the cops were there  and chose not to  Thats not uncommon  but it shows she isnt ready to leave yet  It can take years for that to happen  You cant be more invested in her then she is in herself  I recommend you check out thehotline org and look for the resources for Family and Friends  And be very careful   Jup  I hate it because I've become rather good at getting the few daily attacks i get to go away by breathing slowly and thinking "it's only anxiety  nothing bad is happening"    But in the middle of the night  you cannot always think rationally for the first few minutes when you wake up  so here the pounding heart or offset reality feeling of anxiety still can get it's claws in me    And then the "downward spiral thinking" of how my day at work is gonna suck because of lack of sleep pretty much ensures that I will not get any more sleep   Aaahhh  The joys of anxiety  I'm hoping 2017 will treat me better anxiety wise   Id say Headspace or Calm Totally   We get into this weird "Got to take stock of my entire life and how the last year went"   I got a lot of help from a tweet by JK Rowling that ended with  "Remember  Christmas Day is  in the end  just a day  It isnt a test or a scorecard of you or your life  so be kind to yourself" http   imgur com gallery GJTSn  It's probably more depression  but part of SA leads to us sitting around contemplating things and planning stuff way too much   Try to have a good day just like any other    God  it's the worst  Especially if you're like me and are prone to constantly worry about your health  I've gotten better about it but the thought is always in the back of your head that it could be something more serious like ALS or Parkinson's  Of course I know it's rare as shit but that's just another example of my own irrational fears   I've been dealing with a twitch in my left eye for like 2 weeks and it flares up when I get nervous  It's starting to ease up though so thank god for that  Hopefully our twitches will disappear for the new year and we can celebrate  I have a somewhat long story that I posted last night in a different forum  It is anxiety related  so I figured it wouldn't hurt to share it here as well  I am new to Reddit and this thread so I look forward to looking through it and finding some stories and talking to some people who I can relate to about anxiety  Happy New Year   I just had a pretty crazy 4 hours and I wanted to share it   Basically I had a breakdownand then a breakthrough   The backstory is my life  but I will try to keep it as short as I can so hopefully people read this  I have never posted something so personal  but if even one person gets something from it  I will consider it worth it   Right now  it is 9 pm on 12 30 16 and if this is not the best thing that has happened to me in 2016  tomorrow is going to be amazing  Technically the last part of it happened about an hour ago and I just decide to write about it  It began at 4 when I was dragging my ass out of a funk and trying to take it to yoga   Rewinding a little bit  I just arrived home on Wednesday night  today is Friday  from going home to MD for Xmas  Long story short  my parents had a bitter divorce over 20 years ago and still cant be in the same room so Xmas usually sucks  I wasnt going to go home but based on some realizations in prior months  I decided I wanted to go home not for Xmas  but to talk to my parents about how their resentment towards one another affected me  I could go on and on with examples of ways they have hurt one another and I probably will write a longer edition because it seems therapeutic  but thats not for now   I convinced my parents to meet and so I went home for the holidays for that  I was contemplating not going up until the last minute and cancelled my uber to the airport twice  My anxiety has been reduced for much of the year but started to get very bad when I began making plans to ask my parents to do this  Lets just say it wasnt easy  It took a lot of emotion out of me having to come up with 17 different ways to tell each of them how this affected me  what bothers me and ultimately to agree to it  By the time it came around  I was having such a tough time  I told myself I needed to power through it and at least try  so I went  We talked about how their relationship is unhealthy for my family  I told them that they are the parents and need to set a better example  They ended their relationship with each other and thats fine  but to still hold so much animosity so many years later has affected their relationship with me and my siblings  Even during this conversation they couldnt help but bring up the past and blame one another for how things are today  Again  this is only the abbreviated version  but basically they just point the finger at one another   Another key part of this story is  how  I feel  they handled having a gay child  Growing up  I was bullied a lot for being gay  I wasnt out   This has had a huge factor on my life struggle with anxiety  I never talked about it growing up for fear it would destroy my family  but I found out more recently they knew of it  Growing up in their silence and lack of any type of positive discussion or comments on the topic of anything gay made me feel like I just could not be  I came out at 26 and am now 33  When I came out they said it was ok  but I still sometimes wonder  They still just ignore it  but I have realized thats just how they handle things  This was also the first time I have ever had the opportunity to ask them both at the same time why if they both say they knew I was gay  they didnt talk to me as a child  I have asked them individually  but they usually blame the other  I still dont feel like I got a good answer  but I think I got an honest answer  which I greatly appreciated  Overall  there were some obstacles in the conversation  but at the time it seemed it was a step in the right direction   However  more drama happened after and since I have come back and had time to register it all  plus taking into account other things that I am leaving out  I have felt this sense of doom that nothing will change and I might have to just cut off ties with my family  This might sound extreme  but there is more to it  My anxiety until about an hour ago has been at a lifetime high since I left to come home  It is impacting me in ways that effect my livelihood  I have been doing hot yoga for almost 2 years  It has done wonders for me and my whole mind  body  spirit mindset  I am kind of obsessed   Well  I rushed to class and made it just in time  I got in and immediately started sweating like a pig  When I first started this happened a lot and to the point of it making me self conscious  but I came to appreciate that because I think I am literally sweating anxiety out  This was some next level shit though and the fact that it was happening this way so quickly made me realize it was going to be a long class   Well  it wasnt because it got so bad  I couldnt do it  They tell you when you start that you should never leave class  just lay down and make it through  I always did this  even in the beginning  but by the 30th minute  I was out    the door  Another interesting side note on this is that I was late to class and the only spot was right near the door  I think if I were in my normal spot on the floor  opposite end of the door   I never would have done this   I bolted out without my stuff  went to the locker room and just hung my head in my towel and tried to make sense of what the fuck was happening to me  Since I left my stuff and was not going to go back in to get it during class  I just took a shower and then went out to wait for the class to finish   As I was waiting  feeling pretty guilty for leaving  people began coming in for the next class  As I mentioned before when you are new  they give you the overview and the most important thing is just dont leave  Well  there were a few 1st timers tonight  Also  the teacher for the next class was one of my favorite instructors so as she is telling people this  in my head I am just saying god damnit  this is the one thing that I want to do and I cant even get through an hour because I am so jammed up with this family shit  I started to chat with the instructor and some of the other people working and they asked me how my holiday was  I said it was a little stressful but tried to keep it at that  Once I got caught that I left class though  I think they were like  oh shit  he isnt joking  Class finished and I did my walk of shame in to grab my stuff  I apologized to the instructor who was along with everyone else was so supportive  One of them even gave me a hug   As I began walking to my car  I started to get emotional  Mind you  I am kind of an ice queen  so this is odd   By the time I got to the car  I was in full on bawling  for me  mode   My friend and I had talked about meeting up earlier in the day  but I was feeling so anxious all day that I said I wanted to try to go to class and see how I felt after  I told her what happened and just vented about my Xmas trip  She and I used to be roommates so she gets my family stuff and we definitely relate to each other with family issues so its good we were talking earlier in the day  Otherwise I might have just kept it in  I told her I probably didnt want to go out but was going to eat and see how I felt  She was going to the gym so she said she would text me after  Taking it out helped me to really lay out in my head how crazy it all is and how its slowly eating me alive  After more tears and some long talks with myself I realized that Fuck them  I have told myself in the past  but this time I feel like I believe it  I realized that my whole life I have gone out of my way to try to accommodate them  Whether it was trying to convince myself I wasnt gay for fear of what they would think  acting as if everything is hunky dory when I go home or even just going home since I have probably done that over 40 times for the last 13 years  During that same time  my 5 members of my family combined have visited me a total of 6 times  and I have lived in some pretty amazing places   Anyways  all these thoughts went through my mind  I also came to the realization that I have  at times  allowed them to make me feel ashamed for being gay  Im not saying its their fault and I wouldnt even think this was intentional  but they have  This is due to other factors  such as politics  but the pain has always been there and I just uncovered that   Once I realized this  I feel like everything I felt before just kinda washed away  I realized that allowing these things to stress me out has only gotten in my own way  Not just with accepting myself  but in every other way that this anxiety has tormented me  relationships  socially  physically    Going from such a bad place to how I feel now in such a short time is crazy  I feel like I just let a huge weight off my shoulders  I'm looking very forward to putting this new attitude to work in 2017  This happens to me  too  Whenever a close friend tells me about their own problems and anxieties  I'm always really anxious for them and I try to resolve it by giving gentle advice and suggesting plans of action  I'm the dad friend  complete with bad puns and all   You're not mental at all  trust me  and it might actually be hyperempathy  I've heard it's not all that uncommon for anxiety sufferers    Well in all fairness  I think this year has blown so many buttholes for all of us  I think personally my anxiety was the most extreme it has been in my entire life because of just all the craziness that has come with 2016  I'm sure things will be better in 2017  I remain super optimistic  Thank you  and thank you for taking the time to share your personal experience  It made me feel less apprehensive about taking meds   Ask your doctor if Prozac is right for you  Doing the things that give me anxiety  It sucks  but i just do it  Its getting better now   Thanks     Yes this happens to me too  I will wake up from it with my heart racing and be choking for breath   I think the biggest mistake I made was ignoring my anxiety  It's sort of a natural response  to push back negative thoughts and emotions  Perhaps our culture is partly to blame because we've idealized "happiness" in a sense and are never taught how to manage negative feelings when they inevitably arise  You're expected to just forget and relax and it'll all work itself out  but of course  it never does   It's something I wish our educational system would do for young people because it certainly would've helped me out if I knew what anxiety was and how to deal with it from a young age  Could help so many people   Anyway  I hope your anxiety eases up and you have a good new years  My new years resolution is to stop worrying so much  We'll see how that works out  Thank you for that information  I appreciate your response   What is EMDR  take a break from chocking the chicken Feel free to PM me if you want someone to talk to    3  The way I've improved myself was through my 2016 New Year's Resolution  Never say "no" to invitations    You'd be surprised at the many opportunities that one misses by being afraid to make a move in life   I've experienced many more new things than ever before  Foods from around the world  finally went fishing  finally made new friends beyond my small social circle  finally reached my academic goals and now I find myself starting a new relationship after a couple years of being single   Just follow your heart and happiness will find you  I've always had sleep problems with SSRIs  Also never had vivid nightmares until SSRIs too  I made it out today btw   I really appreciate that  sorry for just now responding  I will definitely take you up on the offer  Hi  I'm new too  so no worries    I started running  which helps the most  I think  I also try to eat fairly decent and to cut down on my caffeine intake when I'm feeling particularly anxious  And I make sure I get enough sleep  That being said  my anxiety is mild to moderate  but all these little things together really help to keep it under control    Edit  I forgot to include this  but if you are religious at all  I also use prayer to help me stay grounded if I am in a really bad place  Meditation is also beneficial  I've used meditation and yoga to help me get to sleep at night    Go to your doc with a list of concerns  This is what I did  All of them were dismissed for being common  explainable things    You pay for you doc  so really you are the one to choose this  The doc will tell you if they believe you need further tests  Beyond that  don't over do yourself  The worry will make you FEEL far far far worse than you really are   I had this when I was around 10 years old it creeped the fuck out of me but eventually I got used to it and learned to cope with it  I'm sure it'll pass just like it came    I have heard it is bad for the liver  but in very very very very very few cases  I've been taking it for a long time and haven't had any issues  I'm pretty good at keeping it in low doses   I figure as long as you don't drink or anything at the same time  it shouldn't be to bad  But I agree with your therapist  I'm no professional by any means and appreciate your input greatly  People who may have liver issues may want to look at some other form of relief  It would be for Lexapro lol  thanks for the response Not a problem my man  I've been there and I really feel for you  so no worries I'm just really glad I could help  If you try it out  let me know how it works for you  But as the above comment states  do be careful if you've had any liver related health issues as the kava could be harsh on yours  I've always been a super heavy smoker  but the past year or so I've been getting ridiculous anxiety and paranoia while high  so I quit a few months ago  I can't even describe the fear  I was deathly afraid of everything  not just social stuff  It was getting way too out of control My anxiety is created from mine lmao  When you have anxiety  it will manifest itself in all forms  Yup  I'm 21 and haven't been in a serious relationship since I was 17  I tried after it  but was feeling kind of emotionally numb afterwards  Now I'm just plain scared of a relationship  even though I want one so bad  I'm so afraid of opening up to someone and sharing my life with them again  Not to mention the lack of self esteem and all that from the anxiety  Fair enough  It is the worry that is making me feel like shit  Wish I could make it stop     Though what am I to do if there's something bothering me that I literally have not yet been able to successfully describe  The experiences you had won't go away overnight  Change can be tough  and you sometimes have to work at it for a long time  It will be faster and easier with the help of a good counselor therapist psychiatrist   Remember that anxiety is not always proportional to risk  The thing to do  if you can  is to take small risks to recalibrate your anxiety  so that you're still afraid of being eaten by a tiger  but not afraid of a woman telling you to fuck off  Give yourself small challenges every day  like saying hello to a stranger  or giving someone a  genuine  compliment  When you don't complete your daily challenge  forget about it  move on  When you do  reward yourself  After a few months  you will see progress  A tiny bit of progress every day quickly adds up  I feel like I wrote this I have a really hard time explaining what happens to me as well  It's a fear of everything  whatever I think about  there is an underlying fear   I think a good question here is this  how did it make YOU feel when it happened what do you think about the situation deep down  I think one thing you could do is maybe sit down with him and talk about it  From what you wrote it seems like he genuinely feels terrible and really misread the situation  however  I can only give my opinion input based on what I have read  Did it make you feel in any way unsafe or violated or give you that creepy gut feeling   you feel like I copied this   No I mean that what you're saying is exactly how I feel I see  I hope it will get a bit easier for you to make friends once you get more comfortable with the language  I wish you a lot of luck and a happy 2017   Depending on where you live  pure CBD may be available in edible or pill form  It does not get you high on its own  at all  I take 5 10mg at a time  It makes me hungry and happy and sleepy  all of which are very helpful for my anxiety  It actually helps me relax   Do your best  Name the location  what it feels like  when it occurs  time of day  With certain food  Certain movements    how frequently  and how much it affects your day to day  The doc should be able to understand the severity  if there's any at all    Please remember I am nothing near a medical professional  Always consult your one for things like this   How long do you think it took you  I've been dealing with it on and off for two years now and I'm starting to feel like it'll never pass and I'll never be able to live a normal functioning life    glad to know I'm not alone  At 10 years old I'm sure it would be extremely scary  Thanks for the support   I used to  sometimes do but less intense  then i figured the world doesn't revolve around me and its an ego thing    When it happens i just observe the thought and let it go  i sometimes laugh about it in my head    This x100  My therapist told me the same Fuck the holidays  Everyone kept bringing up my ex who is the cause of my ptsd and just made things a million times worse for me  Like yes  I know it was a huge mistake being with him thank you for reminding me of a horrible time of my life  Yeah dude it got to the point where even when I was smoking alone at my house  once I'd get high  all I could think about were things that would terrify me  That's what drew the line for me cause I realized that if I'm feeling so uncomfortable just smoking by myself  and not getting any enjoyment whatsoever out of it anymore  there's no point to me smoking  It's a shame cause smoking used to be one of my favorite things to do  but I guess it's nice that I've stopped since I'm not spending money on it anymore  I don't have to be scared of getting pulled over with it in the car anymore  and without it distracting me I've been trying to work on myself the past few months  I've been going pretty hard in the gym the past few months and I'm making great progress  which is helping my anxiety cause of self esteem from getting in shape  and also cause of the endorphins and all that which gets released from hard exercising on a regular basis    Why would you choose to keep experiencing this day by day  night after night   Life is a joke  and death is the punch line   You get to choose what you pay attention to  and what you ignore   Don't believe everything you think  This is very similar to what I've been going through  Maybe check out my posting history and let me know if there's anything you want to talk about  I'll be honest  I've had HOCD and POCD and I've never had the compulsion to engage in or act out my OCD thoughts  Not sure if anyone else can relate or if this has any relevance to your situation   Do you find homosexuality shameful  Meaning  if you were gay would that be a shameful thing for you or if you really felt you were gay could you transition your life and live with it  Having a stable relationship is a good way of having support and keeping yourself grounded when facing all the bad stuff anxiety throws at you  at least in my experience  I have no idea   Edit  I guess I would find it shameful     Stop thinking that you're overly worried about the environment  You have a healthy worry about our planet  The thing is anxiety latches onto anything it finds  blows it out of proportion  inhibits you from taking your mind off of it at all  and makes it seem like it's the end of the world    The way it takes over your mind can be horrifying and make you want to be asleep  Seek professional help when it gets to that level  Medication and therapy can be a lifesaver   Edit  you're not seeing what other people aren't  You're super overreacting because of anxiety taking over your mind  I know it feels like it's a genuine worry  but it's not you  it's you on anxiety  It depends on how comfortable with telling people you are  I've had mild PTSD for many years due to childhood abuse and it became much more pronounced in my daily life after being raped last year  I am super comfortable telling people my experiences and making sure they know why I do certain things I didn't do before  which is totally personal to me  you may feel differently   I'm lucky my friends have been super supportive and understanding  and I think if you feel comfortable with it  it may be beneficial to tell them  I've actually gotten a lot closer with certain people after telling them because they share similar situations  And those who don't understand  I find I don't miss them in my life  Good luck  I hope things work out  friends are such a great support system  Everyone is different but especially since starting medication for my OCD I get WRECKED emotionally after drinking or taking Vicodin  alcohol also effects opiate receptors   It takes up to a week or so to get my mind back together  What I recently noticed is that tequila doesn't have as bad an effect on me and I learned that tequila is the only alcohol  that I've heard of anyway  that is a stimulant instead of a depressant  I'm going to experiment with this further and see if my theory holds out  If not I guess I'm done drinking because it's just not worth it  I really do not recommend self medicating with alcohol  My boyfriend did that with his depression and was an alcoholic for 15 years This sounds a lot like dissociation in general  Probably derealization  but I've found that everything gets kinda blurry within the category of dissociation   Definitely talk with your therapist or doctor  They can give you some good ideas   In the meantime  especially if this is bothering you  try researching grounding techniques  The physical ones especially have helped me a lot  like putting on hand lotion  feeling how my feet feel on the floor  scents  warm showers  etc   I'm pretty sure all effects depend on dosage which is usually increased gradually when it comes to anti depressants  At least SSRI   Sadly those meds can make anxiety worse before they kick in for real  for some people it takes some experimenting with different meds of the same kind to find one that works properly   Yeah right now I use "quick fix" and that's enough at least for now  I'd rather avoid anything more powerful   I keep my dosage as low as possible even now  and especially anti depressants because they made me rather numb emotionally  I'd use them if I had to though but I'd seek therapy ASAP too  It's all about what you smoke  It always made me really anxious  but after moving to Seattle and knowing what exactly I'm smoking and figuring out what i need is a wonderful tool that helps me get the best sleep I've had in a very long time  Coming from someone who never could sleep at all because of anxiety   Well 2 thoughts  1  My HOCD became completely manageable once I stopped caring if I was gay  Once I wasn't frightened by the idea it went away  So work on that  There are many ways to go through life and I know so many wonderful gay people in my life who live very well     2  I would try to figure out through your therapy and treatment why you are acting on your thoughts  Not trying to make your HOCD worse  but I personally find it interesting that you engage in your thoughts  Might be completely normal for OCD  but I think it's worth asking a professional about   If it turned out you are actually attracted to men and you could learn to accept and be ok with that  it could change your life for the better    Yeah man that only happens to me when I'm in an uncomfortable environment  The reason I dont have social media  That and the fact I dont have friends   Ok thanks  can't really go to a professional though  I guess i'll try 'stop caring'   Alcohol makes my anxiety worse  So does caffeine and sugar   First and foremost  focus on your breathing  It's very easy to lapse into mouth breathing or feeling like you can't get enough air  which keep the stress cycle going  Try to gradually slow it down  if you can find some music to time it to that helps  A friend was advised told to hold her breathe for several beats inbetween each breath because it resets the body  since you can't be running from danger if you're not panting   Depending on the severity  at work I would find an alcove and take a moment to text call my bf  ask a colleague to hug me or take a bathroom break so I could drop the mask for a few minutes  If I was having a really bad day I'd let colleagues know I couldn't deal with people and go out back and clean things and count down to end of shift  Using muscle memory is soothing because you're not relying on memory   At family events I hide in my phone  just scrolling through facebook without really seeing it  or if that's not allowed I just put on a listening face and go quiet  If it's a party with animals I go pat play with the pets  you look busy and it's soothing and distracts from using your memory  I find looking at cats really helps  stroking a fabric  I wear a polar fleece jacket so i always have my favourite texture with me   and messaging standing close to my partner  Even just stroking your own arm can help if it feels right   Positive statements can be hard to remember but they can help  as simple as 'it's okay' or 'this will pass'  right up to 'I'm allowed to make mistakes  everyone forgets things  no one expects you to be perfect' ect  Saying out loud to others that you're out of it  had a broken nights sleep or whatever can also take some of the pressure off  Everyone's felt like that at some point  and will be more accepting if you forget or do something silly   My therapist recommends grounding and a safe space you can mentally go to  so you concentrate on the five senses to bring you back to your surroundings  or have  ago to image that's comforting  for me it's a memory of my cat in a quiet house  and you keep building that image up until it feels real with all the senses   I used to dissociate all the time  zero memory  so I started just by staring at something until I could see details in it again  reminding myself where I was  and working on not yelling at myself for forgetting everything  I would write everything down and always put it in the same place so when I panicked I could go there and check what I was doing  as simple as 'phone  keys  wallet' and as complex as the list for closing the store  in order  I wrote it every day because it helped me focus but it still felt like wading through mud in my mind  You're going to forget things and get distracted easily but it's a protective mechanism  you've just got a lot of ram going to processing something in the background and stress puts you into fight flight so it shuts down longterm memory and other processes   I hope some of this helps  It's so frustrating to lose a detail you just had moments before  Removing this post based on prior comments identifyiing poster as a troll   If this is not the case  contact the mods for support  Your welcome   How are you tonight   I am just hanging out at home tonight  Not sure if I'll make it to ring in the new year  I'm getting sleepy lol  I have just gone to bed at 3am after spending 8 hours at a house party with 30 people and 20 of which I never met before today  and I've just been wandering back and forth between the dance floor and the lounge and bar talking to people for 1 minute at a time or less until awkward silence kicked in and made them uncomfortable  How to make 20 people dislike you in one night  and 2017 has only just begun   I just ran out of "awkwardness attempts" and decided I wanted to go to sleep instead  Music is still booming loud out there and the 20 people are still there  It felt like a walk of shame  I'm here as my sister's little brother and we're all adults  so I feel like I've been the ultimate portrayal of self defeatedness  I've not bonded with one person out of 30 and tomorrow I'm going back to my city and study in my dorm and continue to go down my hole of loneliness because every time I go outside I'm met with people I just can't relate to  laughing  slight glances  talking  i'm simply paranoid around other humans  It's crippling Every time  I definitely understand what you mean in a sense  We have similar experiences  I find it interesting what you say about light sensitivity  I get that whitish light while looking at things as well  And the fact that you are also overwhelmed with existence  It really does drive me nuts  I'm actually more comforted by the thought of death than I am life  Also it's slightly terrifying thinking of the fact that we may possibly exist forever  I don't know how everyone else lives without feeling this way  It's just so overwhelming   Life is strange  But I'm comforted knowing I'm not the only one feeling this way  I really hope you and I can get back to feeling normal    Or at least able to cope with these feelings  Does being around other people bother you too   Im a terrible fucking hypochondriac  like 1   2 weeks every month il fucking break down  just this last week i had a huge im going blind scare  turns out im not   but for 2   4 days im a mess 24 7 panic attacks  but after that i go eh  fuck it  mind you i still have slight anxiety as i have GAD    But  in the beginning  i had a huge heart attack scare  and that lasted for a month  what helped me get a huge grip back was going to the doctor  and told them what was going on  and they gave me a A okay  but do to anxiety i was thought maybe they where wrong and they did not see it  but every attack i told myself there is legit nothing i can do and there no point to suffer every day and it helped me power through it  Now this is all pretty jumbled so apologies  if you need to talk about it talk to someone PM me  i have a discord   Also dont google symptoms  you have most likely heard this one a lot but its true  your anxiety feeds off this      I'm currently in therapy  Maybe not being prescribed stuff yet means she doesn't think I'll need them  which is nice  From what you describe  it seems as though he wasn't trying to hurt you   He expressed clear and sincere remorse   What that doesn't change is how you feel about this   Some women can hold a conversation  set boundaries  and feel secure in moving forward   For others  it's a relationship ender   Either is fine  if you know what you want   And I know it can be confusing   The key here is what you believe of him and what you are comfortable with moving forward     If you feel on the fence about it and you believe the relationship is strong otherwise  think about couples counseling   It could be brief and helpful for something like this  I played it once with friends  it got me out and about for the first time in months  But I haven't played it since  I live in a rural area so it's not very good unless we drive to the city   Okay so this morning I didn't have D   so I ate Taco Bell  Which was probably a mistake   since I haven't had anything like that in a week and a couple hours later I had a little D     I'm PRAYING it's from where I haven't eaten something like that in a week   I understand  Looking for ideas can't hurt though    ty for answering my concerns  I think I'm alright with being around other people  Being alone with my thoughts tends to be way scarier  Taco Bell gives most people the shits on a good day  I refuse to eat food that's only going to pay 1 hour of rent   I decided to start using Tinder because who knows  maybe it'll be easier to talk to girls there  I matched with a girl  was very nervous to even start the conversation but forced myself to type in the "hey"  she responded and we talked for maybe like a couple of hours about random stuff  At the end of the conversation I pretty much asked "hey  could we maybe move on to whatsapp " and she gave me her number  Really wasn't any flirting involved  I just sorta talked like I would with a friend   I haven't said anything else to her yet but hoping to ask her out on a date or something tomorrow  even though I have no idea how that should go    Even though it might seem like nothing  this is honestly significant for me because I have a hard time talking to anyone irl  especially girls  because I'm always afraid of rejection   So even if nothing else comes from this at least now I have a little bit more confidence and can sorta copy some of the things that worked this time the next time I talk to a girl   Hi littletoottoot   Unfortunately  what you are going through is very common for a lot of survivors   Some will believe and support you  some will not   There is so much misinformation about sexual assault and what consent is and isn't   Add to that that most people don't want to be put in the position of thinking someone they know is capable of doing something so horrendous   I's easier to blame the victim or think there must have been a mistake  when there clearly wasn't   Having a community  like here or RAINN or therapy  anywhere people will be able to understand your situation and provide support  is good   I always say  despite how much therapy I can do  a major key to recovery is having a good support network   That could be family  friends  or even strangers on the internet who are there when you need them   You are welcome to write as much or as little as you are comfortable   The mods do our best to monitor the forum and remove any unhelpful remarks   I wanted to caution you about requesting PMs from people   We've had some incidents where predators will use posts here to contact and further harm our community members   Use your judgement  but if anyone tries to tell you what happened wasn't rape or was your fault in any way  please report them and break off contact   We usually ask posters to confine their interaction to their threads  but we also understand that a great deal of healing can come from the personal connections people have made here   The best I can say is to be on guard and never give out personal information that could identify you   If   you   decide to PM somebody  that's your choice of course   All my best  Hmmm it's the opposite with me  When I'm alone I'm much more calm  It's also weird that you think smoking brought this on because this is also the reason I had to stop smoking  Instant panic attacks and overwhelming sense of consciousness   Thanks for that  just might be the motivation I need to pick up the phone and make an appointment  My  then  therapist and psyhciatrist described this to me like that  anti depressants suppress your emotions which you actually need to feel in order to sort them out  Therefore  the more you take them  the less you can get out of your therapy  On the other hand they're very useful when you can't get much out of your therapy because emotions are too strong   Based on that knowledge I'd consider it a good sign if they know how hard it is for you  I assume you tell them  and refrain from prescribing anything  If in doubt  just ask them if they think it would help you either with therapy or life in general  110  feel the same man i've been suicidal my entire life  changed how i act around people so they'll like me  i have NO friends  get maybe 2 texts a week from my father pretty much asking if i've killed myself or not  I haven't been to a bar or even a store with a friend for probably close to 2yrs I really  really have been trying to get the balls to hang myself but now i'm thinking of seeing a professional and maybe try meds before I do  idk why i wrote all this shit  wish you the best of luck man Same to you  Happy new year  This is a terrific response   I love how much hope and encouragement you have  given how hard all of this is   I really like your strategies and that you were able to make new  supportive friends   A good chunk of healing work is helping your mind to re focus  sometimes forcibly  onto positive things   You exercised this idea really well  It always happens during times when I've been stressed for a prolonged amount of time  Thank you though  I've decided to attempt to book a doctors appointment  Why can't you go to a professional  Is your OCD not being treated at all  If that's the case it'll just move onto a new theme if you beat this one  That's my experience anyway  Thank you SO much  I totally appreciate all of this advice  I was in the middle of a Fry's department store when I read this  and my anxiety was just running rampant  But looking at quotes was incredibly helpful  It helped me ground myself a little and made me look at myself objectively and not through my haze of emotions   I'm just getting started on mindful meditation  but it's hard to find time to just concentrate on that and not on the hundreds of other things that I do in my day  I'll have to make it a priority in the new year      Thanks again   Thank you for this  I feel like theres days when I'm great but then the smallest things make me feel physically sick in my throat when I think about it going wrong etc  but when it's making me feel physically sick thats when I feel it hard to cope  I think I'll go to the doctors asap and just see what they make of it all  Thanks again  As far as i know i was born with mine too  My mom says so at least  Maybe she was the one that implanted it in my head        Thank you  it didn't even occur to me to really seek medical advice  but you're right  Thanks for your help  it's so hard to function when I can't feel my hands hahaha I'm on mobile and can't talk much but I really didn't want to forget about your post  I'll try to add more later  But basically you're not a social justice warrior  A sjw is someone who is  not always suffering from a mental health disorder or been traumatized  They are the types to want to silence everybody and shut them up if they feel they are saying something that would hurt them or a generalized perception of a large group of people  They appropriated the term trigger from post traumatic stress disorder which caused it to lose all meaning  Trigger for them could literally be anything triggering any emotion  not just a ptsd flashback or severe anxiety atrack  Often times sjws claim different opinions are triggering to shut them up unfairly  Eg  Someone says they don't like then feminist movement  SJWs are very angry and hateful and yell a lot  The term mutated from keyboard warrior  which was just a realky angry person having an unternet fight  Not all feminists are even sjws  it's the super angry hateful people who you can't even talk too    What you're suffering is an anxiety and what you've described are the mechanics and patterns of avoidant behavior from anxiety  It's all just a normal part of anxiety and it doesn't mean you're like the type of people who get called sjws at all    You're not a pussy or weak either  Anxiety is so powerful because it was a survuval mechanism for us   The internet can seem black and white but there are a lot of moderate and sensible people out there  You're one of them yourself  and you're on a place right now full of people who understand   Also since I'm already talking about this I figure it won't hurt too say this  I don't like the people you described either because with safe spaces and self censorship I see them self inflicting and self imposing severe anxiety upon themselves which I have been through because I live with cripplling agoraphobia from ptsd and autism  It's so sad     I'm forced to be with my family   and I already told like 10 jokes nobody laughed at   Pretty much a normal Saturday for me   Yes   Hi lemon   When I know clients I see are having a hard time talking about what happened  and it's nearly always the sexual aspects  I encourage them to keep a journal   It's easier to write down thoughts  feelings  memories  ideas  and let yourself ramble when it's only you   I think one of the reasons online forums can be so helpful is because we are anonymous  which frees you up to write anything   From there  you can begin bringing pieces into your therapist  to look at together  talk about   Sometimes clients will just read to me with a stone face the details of what they went through   Other times  it's just one haunting thought they can't shake   Writing is a great addition to the healing process     I've had clients hand me scribbled notes that say "show this to ChildTherapist" with just a sentence or two on them     Our sexuality and sexual abuse can get very very mixed up together in painful and odd ways   It's sometimes embarrassing to talk about the thoughts and memories we have   Talk with your therapist about what you need to make it safe in the room to say what you need to   Maybe there is something they can do to help you feel safe and contained while you talk   I won't sit here and say you will get past it  but I believe absolutely that you CAN   It's hard and I truly know how much it hurts  but you can move past this and have it be a memory that's less painful   All my best  Idk if classifying ERP as "terrifying" is helpful  per se  ERP is the main thing that can help people overcome OCD  it's tough  but a godsend for those that stick with it   Cheers  Thanks   also  do you know the chances of a 16 year old who doesn't smoke chance at getting lung cancer   Not a marijuana smoker  but I use CBD oil  The oil can bring me down from a panic attack  It is very relaxing  Marijuana also contains THC  which is psychoactive and will get you high and possibly cause paranoia  CBD is the component that acts opposite of THC in some ways  it alleviates anxiety  Different strains of marijuana will have different effects on anxiety depending on THC to CBD ratios  If I were looking for a strain to help with anxiety  I would look for a higher CBD strain   More info on this topic https   www leafly com news cannabis 101 can cbd undo the anxious side effects of thc No worries  It's a busy time of year  All the best to you this New Years  Great   Played a bit of Doom   Late last night ran across a improv comedy club doing a NYE show with appetizers and desserts catered and a toast at the 4 marks of NYE in the US   Wavered on it  but really proud that I bought a ticket and am heading out to it in an hour    Yeah  im the same way with that  but i still had other aspects of SA back then  But thats actually a good point about the bathroom issue The thing I like the most about your goal of working out is that you said you're doing it for yourself  not specifically to find a partner  People who focus on aesthetics and have the mindset of "I have to get ripped in order to find a SO" usually end up giving up on a routine a month or two in   I had a conversion with my sister's boyfriend one of the nicest  most rational people I've met  over Christmas and his words stuck with me  "Don't do it for anyone but yourself  Do it for your health  do it for your own motivation  A lot of people who don't see progress just give up  Keeping fit is not only good for your body but for your mental well being as well "  It's been a long time since I last had a workout routine  I feel the same way as you because I'm scrawny and feel like everybody's watching me at the gym  I've just started to do calisthenics at home every day for at least 30 minutes  Pop in some tunes while you do it and it will fly by  Once you start to build a routine for yourself and stick with it for a couple weeks it'll start to become second nature  Had the same thoughts earlier today  You aren't alone in this tonight   here's a virtual replychug  I don't think it's over thinking   I think you personally have some issue with someone authentically trying to pay you compliments or interact with you positively   Now  I don't know how people do interact with you  could be that it's really fake and worthless  but it sounds like your boss was truly paying you a compliment honestly  and that you can't accept that   When I got some progress on my SA  it surprised me the kind of people I chose to be around during it   It felt comfortable and good to be with people who weren't really positive  or interacting authentically   It sounds like maybe you have friends who belittle you or at least aren't 100  positive people   It also sounds like you can't speak your true feelings  if you get to the point where you are verbally assaulting them in your head   That is something you ought to talk to someone about and work out   Because you should either be able to handle situations where that happens  or you should feel free to say the things you want to say  or you should be able to pick people to be around who won't treat you like that   Not blaming you for any of it  just saying it sounds like a viewpoint that you'd be much happier healthier working on  I'm so glad that you are in a better situation   I hope your benefits are sorted out soon   Is there a food pantry you can visit in the mean time     I think you are the only one who can make the right choice about whether to have a baby or not   If that's what you want  I wish you the best   I am not a mother  but hope someday I will be   There are many joys you will find   No one will pretend that there aren't hard times  too  but for people who want kids  the joys far outweigh the challenges     In my case  I am very thankful that I didn't get pregnant   I was extremely careful with birth control  especially after realizing how abusive my abuser was   I'll admit that I was terrified to see his characteristics in my child   I was terrified that nurture might not be able to overcome nature and have no idea which parts of his personality are nature nurture   I truly hope that your child grows up in a loving home and never exhibits any negative characteristics you saw in your ex   I wish you the very  very best   Good luck getting back on your feet   And Congratulations    My chances are higher when I control most aspects of their environment  Social aspects   Knowing their wishes  needs  social status  education  and quirks opens social dialogues I can choose from  Certainly some find the challenge difficult if their resources are center around their thoughts  My attempts centers around extracting as much information from them through their friends  families  online info  facebook  twitter  forum or whatever site he she went to    Why not just stay home  You know I've always wanted to try improv in a way kinda  I heard it helped with social anxiety   Don't worry  some jokes bomb it's totally cool  As long as you make yourself laugh it's fine  But then again  it's a lot easier said than done  Take a breath  List things you want to do and don't want to do  Then make a plan  That's tough   I've been avoiding all my friends for the past few months because they're doing things with their lives  They've got jobs they're going to school  And here I am  Doing nothing  Just hang in there buddy it'll get better for all of us  I understand you  Not on everything  but a lot  I understand the hiding and keeping you're head down and just feeling dreadful because of school  I'm in my last year   Sigh    Do you have Kik  We chat here if not  but I'd like to chat on Kik so I can know when you've replied  My Kik is idkwhattoputhere      Hello     Firstly  I would like to say that I am incredibly sorry that this was the opening to the new year  It sucks  I'm sending virtual hugs  you must be having a very tough time    Secondly  I'm a disabled person physically  mentally too but my physical illness is invisible  and I believe that people who have depression have the exact same rights to claim disability as people who are disabled physically  Think about this that way  I get money because I can't work due to spinal pain  you can't work due to mental pain  But pain is pain  no matter what form  Please  please don't feel bad about claiming disability allowance     I believe that your parents are doing the right thing by splitting up if they're unhappy however  I completely understand how that would affect you on a deeply emotional level  And while I haven't been through this  my best friend has and I promise you that it's not as bad as it seems  They'll be happier  and soon  you will too   I think that you should take time to grieve  you have every right to be upset  Don't let this define the upcoming year for you  It'll be like any other year  it'll have its ups and downs but in majority of events you still get to turn it around    I hope I haven't said anything that will upset you  I wish you all the best  I know everything is super tough right now but it won't stay like this    If you need anyone to talk to at any stage  feel free to pm me    Okay a few things 1  Come as Gay or Bi if you are still unhappy  or more  You are straight    Even though I have done that and I still pointless worry about it 2  You are aroused by gay porn this could be bc          You have a serious porn addiction  so bad that the acts that degrading  fucked up acts these men are doing arouse you          OR you are genuinely bi but I highly doubt that   DO THIS   STOP MASTURBATING OR WATCHING PORN FOR A FEW WEEKS    A MONTH THEN GO BACK TO THE GAY PORN YOU WERE WATCHING AND SEE IF YOU ARE STILL AROUSED   if you aren't the brain circuits that allowed to be aroused by the gay porn should be gone by then if not and you are still aroused you might be bisexual    IF YOU HAVE CONTEMPLATED SUICIDE BC OF THESE THOUGHTS YOU ARE NOT GAY   THINGS TO DO TO HELP COPE AND OVERCOME    Exercise     Improve your diet     THERAPY         make some friends        some real friends you can actually talk to about this   NoFap    Talk to Women    Meditation    And no matter what deny every "am I gay" thought   after you come out as bi gay if you are still unhappy    Has she sought help  Just out of curiosity  That could be one way to help with the behaviors of OCD  but I understand if that's just not an option    Coming from someone with OCD  I can't even imagine how annoying I am to people around me when I act out  I know that people like my boyfriend and my mom love me  but I'm sure they get sick of how I am  So know you're probably not alone    But  also   maybe try to be more understanding and give her some leeway  It's possible she lashes out because she already feels bad  or maybe even shameful  about her compulsions  and she doesn't know how to communicate that to you  I know I lash out against those close to me when I'm having a panic attack or in the middle of a compulsion just because I'm already feeling bad about myself and my OCD  and if someone says something negative to me about it  it just adds fuel to the fire   Also  be communicative with her and let her know how you're feeling  but also that you're here for her to come to  I had to learn how to communicate how I was feeling with my OCD  and my mom had to lean when to step back and say   ok  I don't know what you're going through  but I'm here  So it's a two way street    Good luck  I really want to also   I listen to a bunch of improv podcasts and they are often the funniest part of my week   I actually found this show tonight because I met some people who took classes at the theater  and remembered that I meant to check out classes starting in January   They are all booked  but found the show tonight so at least have something to do   Hopefully it's awesome and I can see about taking classes in April   But I also think Improv to many of us SAers is like the deep part of the pool   We spend so much time censoring  planning  prepping  evaluating  that just speaking off the cuff isn't something we have the ability to do   Not sure if this will help in that regards  or if it'll just reinforce it   People here have said it helped them a lot  I feel you both  I can't remember a time my PTSD and depression have acted up this much  It's really making me hate the holidays  Pour water on your arm from a sink and change the temperature occasionally  Best of luck  You'll get through this  Thanks for the response  I forgot to mention it  but I tried Buspar a few years ago with no results positive or negative  How did you deal with POCD  I'm sooooo scared My mom said it didn't do much for her either  honestly  Might be because I'm borderline underweight that I'm getting anything out of it This along with "if they wanted to come  they would have said 'yea  I'd love to see you '  I don't know why I attempt to make plans with people  I've used so called "legal" CBD before   If you don't live in a state where cananbis is legal  then the CBD products available to you are derived from industrial hemp for the most part   Most of that is imported from China and is complete garbage   Having said that  I have used CBD oil drops and it did have a positive effect without making me too drowsy   However  after about a year it stopped working   I don't know if I developed a tolerance or if what I was using turned to crap  imported from china   If you live in a legal state  then get to a dispensary and try some of the good stuff   Forget about the headshop crap   For more information  visit  r cbd    A useful alternate to CBD is Kava   It works on the GABA receptors much like alcohol and xanax  but without most of the negative side effects     I can take it in the morning and still have a productive day   Buy ground kava powder only  the extracts and pills should be avoided as you don't know what kind of kava was used to make them   Kava generally comes in three forms   ground root powder  micronized powder  more finely ground and prepared root   and instant   Kava is normally prepared as a drink  but it is very nasty tasting and can numb your mouth   You can fill gelcpas with instant and micronized kava as an alternative     I have been using Kava for a couple of years now and this shit works  as effective as CBD if not more so    It's not strong enough to stop a full panic attack once it comes on  but it works rather well as a daily preventative   To try it out  I recommend the instant sample pack for Gourmet Hawaiian Kava     Visit  r kava for vendor info and recommendations   Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing   You can read a lot about it here    http   www emdria org  page 2 I just cleaned the bathroom and am currently cleaning the clothes  I am worried being that close to the virus  At one point my gloves snapped and sprayed some water on my clothes  I'm worried during cleaning something got in my mouth somehow  My wife was sick more than 48 hours ago  and I haven't got it yet  so I thought I might be safe  But I feel like now I have to reset the clock     I'm still dealing with it  The key for my successes thus far is acceptance and thought segregation  I first had to accept that these thoughts are a part of me  just thankfully not the "true" me  I am truly not attracted to children  but I have to accept that thoughts about it is a part of me  That acceptance is the key to conditioning your brain to have have the fear reaction  That's the basis of ERP therapy   Those first couple hours  days  weeks of the acceptance are so hard   It feels so wrong and counter intuitive  which in reality shows you are not what you fear you are    Then the segregation part  I identify my OCD thoughts as  "Scumbag Brain"  It allows me to sort of disassociate from the OCD thoughts and keep them separate from my conscious  real thoughts   Aside from that I am also on a low dose of Cymbalta for my OCD and Vyvanse for my ADHD  My understanding is that Cymbalta doesn't really help with the thoughts themselves until high doses  but it helps me deal with them due to less depression and more balanced brain chemistry   oh snaps   huh     i'll be damned   didn't know it existed   ty  no problem  I had no idea what it was until my therapist suggested it to me  I've done two sessions of it   and it actually really is helping me  Hey OP  I am actually going through this now  I took 2 drags from a joint and it hit me  At that time heart started racing and I am having the worst panic attack  Would really appreciate some tips to deal with this  Lexapro is my wonder drug  I thought I'd try something else in September  long story  so my doctor prescribed Trintellex   Didn't work   So then we switched to Effexor XR  and that didn't help  So I asked to go back on my Lexapro  Within a week I am feeling better  I am eating at least one  sometimes two  decent meals a day again  I  totally  related to what you wrote about how food is repugnant right now  My sleep isn't completely back  I wake up with high anxiety  so my doctor has prescribed Klonopin to help with that until the Lexapro kicks in more  Klonopin is slower to act  but it lasts in the system a bit longer  I take the Klonopin before bed  so it gets me through the night and the first part of the day  and then I usually relax as I start my routine  I take Lexapro in the AM        Hugs     I have also found that alcohol and or Opiates WRECK my thoughts for about a week  It feels like I'm starting all over after each time I drink or take a Vicodin for my back pain  Time to make some adjustments I guess  I often have symptoms after reading about them  It feels so real that they're scary  but it's also too coincidental that I would really have them   As I wrote in response to a different post tonight  Lexapro is my wonder drug  I thought I'd try something else in September  long story  so my doctor prescribed Trintellex   Didn't work   So then we switched to Effexor XR  and that didn't help  So I asked to go back on my Lexapro  Within a week I am feeling better  I am eating at least one  sometimes two  decent meals a day again  My sleep isn't completely back  I wake up with high anxiety  so my doctor has prescribed Klonopin to help with that until the Lexapro kicks in more  Klonopin is slower to act  but it lasts in the system a bit longer  I take the Klonopin before bed  so it gets me through the night and the first part of the day  and then I usually relax as I start my routine  I take Lexapro in the AM  When I am properly dosed and taking my Lexapro  it cuts it by 95   I hardly feel any anxiety  I didn't have any new year texts messages   I don't really care about this anymore      If people don't invite you it's because they don't want to  because they are not the good "people" to hang with   because they might be like you   alone     Happy new year   Happy new year    Stay strong brother   I was underweight when I took it  The psychiatrist I saw at the time said that it would either help or do nothing   pretty low risk medication   so I'm glad it's working for someone     Is there something your doctor can prescribe to help out with that  I understand what you shared  though  I get so discouraged when I can't sleep through the night  I try not to worry about how it will affect my day later on  but I do  My doctor prescribed klonopin  taken at night  to relax me enough to keep me asleep and keep my anxiety lower in the morning  when it tends to be its highest   Klonopin is longer acting than Xanax or Ativan  Once my Lexapro becomes fully functional  I shouldn't need the klonopin   Puts me to sleep in 25min  That's fantastic to hear  I think Lexapro and Citalopram are pretty similar  But it's so good to hear that you've had bad reactions and still found something that works for you  And sleeping and eating  I'll ask about Klonopin   I'm about to make a smoothie and see if drinking instead of eating helps  but so far today I've eaten half a poptart and some apple sauce  Ugh  Very remote  with no previous diagnosis of any cancer and not smoking  pretty much  100 chance it is a correctable or manageable issue  Once you have those tests done and know what it is the worry should subside  you can get any help you need and not fear the unknown  Happy new year  We'll be all right  Yes  smoothies are good  I also will drink chicken broth or protein drinks  Atkins   I like yogurt and applesauce  too  Occasionally I can manage to eat some buttered toast  As long as I am getting some nutrients  I feel successful  I try not to weigh myself because seeing the scale go down down down increases my panic a bit  Hang in there  You are not alone   I prefer this one  https   s media cache ak0 pinimg com 564x f5 59 d7

have a LOT of mom friends and 99  of us struggle   Yes I remember that show   Love Lois   Probably  once you start liking someone  you find more reasons to like them and you are less likely to see flaws as well  Try it  It didn't work for me after 8 weeks at 40mg  but has helped others  I didn't have many negative effects other than slight decreased appetite for a week or two and increased anxiety   Often SSRI SSNI cause anxiety before it calms it   You will get over this  Depression is rough  You are going to feel like you will never be well again  but that's just the depression talking  Try to seek some help from a therapist and or a psychiatrist  Wishing the best for you   I get what your saying  I get bothered because I'll have racial slurs in my head even with my own race  Wow  This really hit home  I ceased to do that  I  Know i should be doing this but I put it off Welcome  Sorry for the late reply  I was dealing with alot this weekend  Woah that ones been hitting me alot  what if i don't have ocd  I've been getting alot of "kill myself" thoughts as well as thoughts of whether " what if im straight and The attraction and thoughts I have towards girls is a intrusive thought instead"  I am bisexual btw  Hello   Of course this post belongs here   It's great you are in therapy   I often lose my temper due to anxiety   I try to be aware of it so I can proactively control myself   I have three children and they don't deserve it   Have you tried medication   I recently started lexapro and I think it's helping   What about exercise  meditation  yoga  First I would like to say I am very sorry that this person you thought was a friend has turned out to be a piece of shit and a scumbag and is taking advantage of you  I would also like to say that it's not your fault  He knew that you were in a bad place mentally and he was the one who took advantage of that for his own sick gain  You are not diminishing rape or sexual assault by posting this  What happened to you is STILL a form of sexual assault and you are absolutely allowed to feel violated  He had also  from what you have written  threatened you  Do you still have the messages he sent you where he said he could "make your life a living hell"  If you do  save those  I would advise taking legal action  if you want to  It is ultimately your decision  and if you do  absolutely keep those messages from him as evidence  Nobody has the right to do this to you  nor do they have the right to threaten you like this   Why were these helpful comments deleted  It seems like  r anxiety has a religious agenda  I feel like this should be addressed   So what was her excuse for not making lunch    I got High off of brownies and had intrusive thoughts  However  while high I don't tend to respond to thoughts and remain extremely calmed  This caused me to panic and now I'm anxious again  But thank you so much for replying I put it off too  but I think if the habit gets started it will continue and become just part of your day  I have more intrusive thoughts that I didn't mention and really feel that the journaling will help  I can totally understand where she is coming from  Her boys are just out of control and full of trouble since birth and she is just overwhelmed and these are not your average boys   I mainly do edibles  I usually chill then eventually fall asleep if i'm alone  I used to be against any usage of substances until I tried it  really helped to calm my nerves  Just general tips if you do deicide to try it  be careful not to overindulge as edibles take longer to work and drink a shit ton of water unless you want dry mouth  don't make the same mistake as me All the time It's okay  man  Hard to say  There's no way that you  ought  to feel  if it's something that you've got past and can look on it as an unpleasant but time limited experience  that's a marvellous thing  Getting to that point does not  of course  diminish the seriousness of the crime itself   However  the society in which we live is so thoroughly vicious to men who have been raped that it's easy to imagine victims feeling that they have no option other than to be "all right" with this  Emotionlessness can be a coping strategy in such situations   May I ask what drew you to this subreddit  I might be wrong  but it seems to me that just finding out that this place exists took a bit of effort on your part  That would seem to indicate that it's still on your mind to some extent  Hi  That's awesome that you're interested in support groups  If this is the first time you are trying group therapy and you have any questions  don't hesitate to ask me because I've had a trillion hours of it  I hope you can benefit from support groups like I  and many others I personally know  have benefited   OK   are you familiar with psychologytoday com's support groups finder  You can search by your zip code or city  or nearby ones   Then look on the left sidebar to narrow down your search by what you want the group to focus on  There should be contact information  so you know who to email or call  Check out DBT   I have similar thoughts worries and myths and this therapy method has helped me a lot   Hi  My psychiatrists saved my life when they prescribed my medication  and that is not an exaggeration  Simply put  my mind and body do not function anywhere near 100  without my medicine    I'm on 225 mg of the generic version of the antidepressant of Effexor XR  and I'm on five milligrams of the generic version of the anti psychotic Abilify  I'm also on medication for hypothyroidism  but hypothyroidism developed waaaay after depression and anxiety  My results below are from my psychiatric medication  These are my experiences     I am no longer suicidal  I want to live  no more terrible headaches  much more energy  no more extreme fatigue  I sleep a regular amount instead of sleeping anywhere from fifteen to twenty hours a day  I don't want to self harm at all  no more brain fog  I can concentrate normally  my appetite has returned  I can actually leave my home  I am not stuck in bed  my hair has mostly grown back  being suicidal  depressed  and anxious put such a huge stress on my body that my most of my thinned and fell out   I can retain information that I read and hear  my memory is normal  I regained my appetite  my body doesn't feel like it weighs a million pounds anymore  no more body aches at all  I am no longer anywhere near being on the verge of having a panic attack  I am so much more calm  no more breakdowns  sex drive has returned to normal  no more crying spells  can tolerate a much higher level of stress without breaking down  I am not angry  I can feel all emotions again  I'm no longer numb  no more racing thoughts  no more constant feeling that the worst is going to happen     I haven't experienced a single side effect from my antidepressant at all  The only side effect I've experienced from the anti psychotic is increased hunger at higher doses  I'm on a lower dose now  so it's not an issue  I don't want to downplay the importance of my therapists though because they are also heroes   I mean this respectfully  but would it be possible to update your doctor on how you're doing when you get the chance  This doesn't necessarily mean that your medicine will be increased  but it's important to tell your doctor how you're doing  This is entirely your decision though  so no pressure from me   I got sick and and then told get back to work then got cranky sicker and was told to leave  Yeah I've never had the best experiences with trying to form relationships  I always assume I'm annoying or not important good enough to the person  I don't want to be in a relationship and force that person to be with me  I also don't want to show my aggressive jealous side It was terrifying for me is what I meant but you're absolutely right  It is what helped more than anything else  I literally stumbled onto it while digging through Reddit wasting time since my wife is at work  Realized my unanswered question and decided to ask  Hi  So first off don't worry about sounding unreasonable  I highly doubt anyone here will put you down or judge you    You're seeing a therapist  that's great  First piece of advice I tell anyone is to see a therapist and you're already on it  When it comes to medication you'll get a lot of different opinions but honestly for me it was always a temporary fix  new medication every year for 3 4 years  as they would just stop working  I actually was off medication when I started feeling better but that's just my personal experience    I also had OCD related to food  I couldn't eat the first part of whatever I looked at unless it was the left side of it  OCD is weird ay   and I would constantly throw stuff out but ya gotta eat  Try to find something if you can  easier said than done I know    With your parents I'm hesitant to comment on it because it's such a personal thing  I guess the best thing to say is help and support them if they deserve it but don't sacrifice your own health happiness    I really hope this helps and please feel free to PM me if you want to get into more details or if you have any questions    I'm glad I'm not the only one  Then I spend ages contemplating if I should delete it or not  Nevermind  he deleted his account not the comments   hah  yeah      i find that the less i think about my crippling mental illness  which isn't often but   the less i fuck up my actual life  What if you don't know what you want  Thank you for your support  I really appreciate it  Unfortunately I don't have the messages as they took place via snapchat    Currently on vilazodone 40 mg d plus gabapentin 3600 mg d plus clonazepam 1 mg about 1 2 times per week   This is the best I've been in a long time  Previously on citalopram  venlafaxine  and duloxetine and they all dulled my sexual appetites way too much  Vilazodone plus gabapentin is a reasonable compromise   Many people are going to need higher doses of paroxetine  Paxil  than you're on   Ideally  meds should decrease your anxiety like 80 90   Sitting by myself while my roommates have a great time with their plethora of friends and boyfriend  Cried a little and I don't feel like intruding on any of their fun  Who am I to butt in  This time last year I was making an awful choice to betray someone and karma got me as I sit here all alone thinking about how I've treated people and put myself in this lonely situation  Too anxious and awkward to go out    so sitting and watching Netflix with beer   thinking about whether or not I'll always be alone like this  God I hate the holidays and I can't wait for this to be over   Awww you've been doing great lately  don't let tonight get ya down  I think New Year's Eve is an easy trigger for us  you know  I stayed in and turned down invites because the thought of being in loud  huge crowds and driving on the roads when alcohol is popular tonight just   no  Not even if my wife was with me  she's my safe person  or if it was close to home  Sigh  Anyhow  this tends to be a wild night so  I think we can be gentle with ourselves   hugs   PS   I feel like all the celebrity losses in the last week or so has made my anxiety ramp up  Totally irrational  I know  Hopefully when the clock strikes midnight here  15 more minutes  I'll start to calm down a bit   Hi there  For me the road to recovery started with ERP and once I was able to limit or eliminate many of my compulsions  which took a while  I then focused on the anxious thoughts and obsessions  It's still something I struggle with on a daily  probably hourly  basis but I've gotten pretty good at letting the anxious thoughts just naturally pass through my mind  I first try to realize what I am thinking is irrational  I always always make a point of actually saying to myself "this thought is irrational"  and then I let the thought play it's course in my mind  rather than working myself up by trying to eliminate it  and it's usually gone pretty quickly  If the thought persists I do some deep breathing or go to find a distraction  exercise and movies being my go to distractions when I'm not at work   I don't mean to put these strategies in a way to make them sound simple or easy because they are not and a good therapist could probably describe them much better than I can   Don't undermine the work you've done  OCD and anxiety changes so coping mechanics need to change too sometimes  Keep your head up  I think all of us who have suffered from OCD and anxiety are mentally tough people even though sometimes it can feel like the opposite    I hope I didn't ramble too much and you can PM me whenever  Happy New Year    I get psychotic reactions if I'm not tired enough to sleep  and regardless I end up exhausted and depressed the next 2 days Volunteered to work 4 hrs early  My coworkers all were surprised that I came in early  Now I feel like a loser because they know nothing is at home for me  First  you need to find a psychiatrist who specializes in OCD    Second  you can find books and websites about ERP  It's a step by step process  Touch something dirty  Wait a bit longer than you normally would without washing  Increase the time that you wait each time  You're retraining your brain to be okay with being dirty and that nothing bad will happen    Finally  you also have to protect your skin to avoid infection  Maybe wear gloves  Even if you put on lotion and cotton gloves while you sleep  that would help  Look for hand creams that work even after hand washing  Use gentle soap  Don't use super hot water   You are most certainly entitled and deserving of help and support regarding these flashbacks regarding your ex  You are suffering secondary trauma which is not uncommon   I strongly suggest that you reconnect with your therapist or find a new trauma therapist that you are comfortable working with  Until you are able to cope with what you are struggling with  you really can't be much support to your ex  I also suggest that you consult with your therapist about how you might support your ex and take care of yourself at the same time    You can't be at your best supporting someone else while your own well being is suffering    Take good care of yourself  I know my thought was always "if they wanted to talk to me  they'd initiate a conversation " Got very lonely and loss a lot of friends in one year     Good luck in the new year  I think we all need it   First  let me say my heart goes out to you  Mental illness is no joke and can be very hard to deal with    Secondly if you have any thoughts at all about doing something reckless or hurting yourself please call a crisis hotline  You can google 211 in your area or just call 1 800 273 8255 if you're in the USA    I really hope you find a way to cushion the impact of this breakdown  Maybe call your therapist if you have one   Ha  yep  Got "invited" to a little shindig by two different people attending  but not by the hosts  Wouldn't go because they know me and I was like if they wanted me they would've invited me  Binge watched black mirror and cried a little instead  Fuck  I used to smoke 24 7 then it started giving me panic attacks so I quit for over three months  It didn't help very much  If I lived in a legal state I would try different types to see if it helped  I will say vaping wasn't as bad for me   I feel the exact same way as you do right now  I've been in this mood since Wednesday night  I saw my therapist on Wednesday afternoon and I'm too scared to even call her this soon  I want to tell her how I feel  but again I'm scared  If I tell her I want to put a bullet in my brain but I'm too scared to will I be hospitalized  I have all these thoughts running in my head constantly now  My mind is just constantly racing  I feel sad as fuck and then I'm angry because I feel like I have no reason to be so sad  I know if it gets to a point where I can't personally deal with it I have a few options and those are calling her  calling 911  or going to the hospital  I'm scared as hell at those options  I know these feelings will pass until next time  There is lots of us fighting this fight  Every day is a struggle  There's no right answer of what to do nothing makes it any better  You just have to ride it out and if it gets too bad to where you can't handle it you call for help or go to a hospital  It's scary as hell to think about but that's the best advice  Happy New Year  From one lurker to another  You should seek out counselling or a therapist   The first time I used it I felt calm and sleepy then pretty much nothing after that  I only tried two brands though and supposedly it takes two weeks of use to get the full effect  I found a small supplier I'm gonna order a different type and some skullcap tincture    I would say try it  I don't think it would make things worse for you  Definitely research it though   Happy new year  That is sound advice  but I feel the reason why it felt especially bad this time was it was from someone I felt should know me better  Now I worry that all I've been the entire time I've known said person is this "mansplanner " It's not someone I'm close with anymore  so was able to calm myself after a while  but it still bothered me  Thank you for the response  I am sorry you have this reaction   Your feelings of being betrayed and taken advantage of are valid  Many survivors feel this   Have you considered talking with a trauma therapist about all that you are feeling  A properly trained professional would understand your feelings and be able to help you process what you are dealing with  You feel SA when you change profile pics also    Hey can you link any of the podcasts  It's definitely something I'd want to atleast try someday   I actually feel like I've ended 2016 on a good note  Ok I didn't make it out to any huge parties but I forced myself to meet the friend group for a couple drinks  and even played a round of charades  before returning to my room while they went out   Not true  Just because you came to work early does not in any way shape or form make you a loser   Holidays suck  I can't help but get a little jealous when I see people on social media doing things  Going out and socializing  partying etc  While I'm stuck at home doing pretty much nothing except browsing the Internet  gaming  and using reddit  Heh  guess that ties into Internet usage  They'll be over soon though  Don't worry  Honestly you can't worry about what your doctor thinks  If something concerns you  go  I can attest to the power of a medical professional setting my mind at ease  You should also be up front that you suspect anxiety so they can treat that as well  if they aren't already  That's awesome  Ok is good  Have a happy new year    You too    Alcohol is a stimulant in low doses  I would not recommend it at all for anxiety  If you get a lot in your system it will become a depressant intoxicant   Thanks  Here's to another year of being scared shitless of everything but doing it anyways   Remember  there's no bravery without fear  keep it up  Receiving a text releases hormones that makes you feel good inside as it is like you're having a "success" moment    I forgot the name of the exact hormone   dopamine  but it is the same as when you're gambling  drinking  smoking  blablabla   So it is totaly normal to feel good when you receive text because it feels like you're winning as someone is talking to you at a random moment  It makes you feel important  This is why some people are addicted to recieving texts  As someone who drinks   a lot   to escape her OCD  which I'm perfectly aware is unhealthy   kind of   I still have my symptoms but I'm able to stay distracted and ignore them a lot more easily usually   If I don't keep myself distracted while drunk  however  I become hyper aware of my symptoms and get really depressed    congrats buddy  I always feel nauseous but have not thrown up in a long time as well  It's the small victories  I'm really hoping this is the case  Thank you for your perspective I wish friends would text me  But im a boring loser  so why would they  Thank you  Happy New Year  My advice would be to try other therapists  Although it might feel nice to feel almost like you're friends with your therapist it's better to have a therapist who can guide you through your issues   Maybe I'll start with genetics to test the waters  I'm generally skittish with opening up   Thank you for the advice  Happy New Year  You did it  Congrats     You sound like an interesting guy  and I'm glad you overcame your fear of posting to share yourself with us  Good luck with your therapy  This also applies to sports scores  If I doesn't go the way I envision  I could twitch in my eyes or other facial muscles  The numbers need to make sense    I know this sounds very odd  I just recently wrote a blog post that I think may help you  http   ariaesthete com married anxiety guide happily ever  Good luck in your endeavors   Thanks I'm going to schedule an appointment with an allergy specialist and see what's up  Thanks for the advice  i was talking to my counselor  and she told me to try changing things a little at a time  for example  if you normally wash your hands for 5 minutes  stop after 3  then as you become acclimatized to 3  slowly whittle your time down in that same manner until it's at a "socially acceptable"  awkward phrase  more like  a normal  healthy level     it shows you that ocd is not unchangeable and that you do have a say in how things go   your rituals do not have to be rigid and control you  this is how i dealt with my ocd in terms of handwashing for the most part Are you asking if you were raped by your mother's boyfriend  Or your friend  This is super relatable  I'm awful at replying to texts because I find the interaction exhausting  It's like  on one hand I prefer texting to face to face conversations but then part of me is like 'well we're not actually hanging out so its okay if I drop the conversation randomly as soon as I get tried of it '   I'm constantly at war with myself because I definitely need people to keep texting me so I know they don't hate me or whatever but then I also wish people would stop texting me so I could stop feeling like shit every time I drop a conversation  I hate this yeah     it's definitely a struggle but we'll all get through this  cheers to finding someone else who understands though  Is your post still up  Do you have a link to it or can you give me the gist of it    Also I'm not entirely sure what your question is  Are you asking why his comments got removed  I'm sorry that your meds aren't helping  and that you feel that your mother isn't taking you seriously  Are there any local youth mental health groups that you can contact  Not sure which country you are in so can't offer specific advice there  Also do you have a school counsellor or someone that you can talk to  You really need to try to open up more  as hard as that is  people cannot help if they don't know the true extent of what is happening  Also given that you have been given medication  it seems that you are being taking seriously  as your mother has taken you to a doctor and gotten you meds  Perhaps just talk to her again  wrote a letter  send an email  anything that makes it easier for you to tell her how bad you're feeling  It may be that she just doesn't know the extent of things  Also I don't think that anyone will look at you as a druggy and not prescribe medication   I got out for New Years and loved it   It was my first time out for a new years at all    I usually stay inside and do nothing  be we drank milkshakes and talked for hours  I had next to no anxiety besides driving home  I've resolved to get out more this year and hopefully I'll commit to the change    It's the small victories that count  happy new year  r anxiety   i'm sorry that this happened to you     when you say that it could've been worse  i hope you realise that you deserved way better than that  because nobody should have to deal with any of that    you're not to blame either  thanks for sharing   cheers     you're making progress and doing your best  and that's all that matters   all the best to you  I don't think this is silly at all  What do you want to happen  Do you want to be able to feel comfortable going out of your room when people are there  or are you fine the way you are  but just feel "stupid" for acting that way  Like what is the desired outcome here  I was  and unfortunately still am  in your exact situation  except I'm 24 and it's really bad   I'd say go see a psychologist  yes I know you said you don't want to but trust me I didn't either and I ended up really enjoying it   I went to a doctor recently and he put me on propranolol but I haven't seen much of a difference   At least not yet   I'm sorry this isn't a helpful comment  I always recommend everyone to try meditation because it's great for relaxing and calming yourself down  Good luck  There is no better way to dismiss someone than just slapping the SJW label  Any diagnosis takes time  there are so many mental illnesses that have overlapping symptoms  and it's not as simple as going to one appointment and coming out with a diagnosis  It takes a while and you need to stick with your doctor psychiatrist and work with them  be open and honest and give them some time to connect all the dots and figure things out    I think your changing personality is just a coping mechanism  and it helps to keep your anxiety levels down  Have you tried explaining any of this to your boyfriend   My mothers's boyfriend So your parents saw you running around in a panic  they called out to you  you didn't hear  and they let this go on for 30 minutes without chasing you down or getting close enough for you to hear them  This thought comes to mind basically whenever I see someone on social media posting about a party or something  Thank you for letting a lot of us know we are not alone   Same  I can see why you're stressed  But I think you should at least try to apply for jobs  don't assume that because you have no experience no one will be interested  everyone has to start somewhere  The bottom line here is that if you want to live in the same city as your partner  then you need to start applying for jobs  as overwhelming as you're finding that  I can assure you that burying your head in the sand and ending up with no job  living in a different city to your loved one will be a lot more stressful  Just think about what you want  you want to be near your partner  so you need to try and make that happen   Comedy Bang Bang is the best   It's gotten really weird and hard to get into   But I super recommend it  especially if you can do it from the start   It is really surprising just how much they never turn down an idea and how completely wacky things get sometimes   SPONTANEANATION is really good because they have a little joking interview with the guest  then improv working in things they talked about   They are both exactly my kind of goofy  wacky comedy  Don't be so hard on yourself  Those things aren't as simple as clicking your fingers and being a different person  It's a long process  and you shouldn't feel so disheartened  you have 364 days left to succeed   You didn't already blow it  Those are all wonderful resolutions  just try again tomorrow  Having a bad day doesn't mean it's the end  it just means you had a bad day and to try again tomorrow  "But every day is a bad day  " Yes yes   So work on that  what would improve your days  Need to calm yourself  Do deep breathing and meditation  then return to your task once you've calmed down   Smile at yourself in the bathroom mirror  trust me it helps   hey even laugh out loud  alone of course   go full on Tidus  props if you know FFX   You can also try the yoga pose Lifting the Sky  it's an amazing way to calm down    I hope I helped  chin up friend  you haven't already failed  you just slipped on some January ice and have stood back up  Thank you  When I wrote that I was just feeling so terrible and down and I'm really going to look into what you said here  Its just hard for me because even if a family member just knocks on my door and tells me dinner is ready or something I feel my heart beating rapidly and my throat closing up  Thanks though for real  End what   It could be a million things  It could be nothing  Are these "symptoms" always random  Do they appear when you're stressed or worried about something  Do they get worse when you notice them  I'm so proud of you  I have anxiety toward doctors and medical facilities  and I've had to do exactly what you did today  I know just how hard it can be  so please believe me when I say that I'm incredibly proud of you  When did this all start   Hey  Still thinking of you and sending my love  that's a good question  Ideally I want to be the kind of room mate that is social  has dinner with them every once in a while  but I also just   like to be on my own  It's so odd to me but it makes sense  The guilt comes from feeling like I have this obligation that since I live with them I need to hang out with them  be friends  etc   Relaxing  What's that  Never heard of it  Haha  Not possible for me   What meds did you get  Sorry to hear that  How does your anxiety manifest itself in your life   I'm sorry you're going through this  I can relate to a lot of what you're saying  Feel free to inbox me if you'd like to chat   Hmmm  Sort of  When I'm at work  where I should be stressed the most  it's almost always not there    But the most recent trigger was receiving a bad news  and my heart rate just went up and my head started feeling heavy  So yes  maybe stress bad news can be a cause   Lastly  yes  the more I pay attention to it  the worse it feels  Exercise usually helps  or sleeping I don't go to college  but I will obsessively plan every aspect of my life  I make plans and then I make plans for plans  It's just a coping mechanism   There are worse things out there to deal with anxiety  at least weed is only bad for your lungs  if you smoke it   It isn't corroding your liver like booze or frying your brain like benzos   Yep   heard it all before  "You know it's not real" "just stop thinking" "just make yourself stop" "stop pretending" "just relax" "pull toe head out of your ass"  I really wish people wouldn't be so narrow minded and judgmental just because they don't understand it   Happy new year  Im supposed to start at midnight but came in at 8pm  Thanks though  It definitely sounds like you could be experiencing some sort of anxiety  My advice would be to try and see your doctor  perhaps get a referral to a therapist  or even a CBT or DBT program  Hotlines are good too  as are subs like this where you can talk to people who understand  Also look mindfulness for anxiety  it may help you  Lastly  if you ever need someone to talk to  please don't hesitate to inbox me   Currently taking gabapentin   75mg in the morning and 150mg at night  during the first two weeks anxiety decr eased but a month later   I feel anxiety symptoms palpitations  the drug is working maybe at 70   I believe the decrease in efectivity it is due to tolerance buildup   yeah pretty much I don't think you were too sensitive at all  I think it's perfectly reasonable to be upset about the way he went about that  Saying he was "just being honest" is BS   he was being rude and abusive and if that's how he treats people who do him favours then he really doesn't deserve them    I hope you are feeling ok  Please don't be hard on yourself  Understood  For what it's worth  my suggestion would be to go with whatever seems to be working best for you  Sometimes things like this only come to the surface when people's lives are going well in other respects    when the psyche finally is assured that it's safe to address the matter  But some victims don't feel the need to address it at all  and as long as that doesn't involve the expenditure of large amounts of mental effort to keep the lid on things  it's as correct a response as any other  Lexapro really helps me  It at least takes the edge off  As mentioned below it does kill your libido though   Also  no good doctor would describe benzos long term  they're too addictive and the more you take  the more you need   i really appreciate you taking time to help me see that my way is apparently working  Thank you so much    Seventh grade was the start but it all started coming down just this year a few months ago to where I can't handle the constant feeling of terrible anxiety and wanting to throw up even if I'm just alone  Omg this is so weird      I thought I was really the only one who thought about stuff like this      like sometimes it's just a battle to just not think about it for fear that thinking about it will make it happen       I am really blown away by this  I lived with my in laws  and they ate dinner together every night at 5 30 as a family  I was used to living alone and eating alone  I hated going to make food when anyone was around  and even hated using the toilet  As soon as it started getting closer to dinner time  I would get more and more anxious  and when 5 30 came  I would feel awful  heart beating out of my chest  feeling sick and have red blotches all over my face and neck  my biggest anxiety sign   The last thing I wanted to do was eat  BUT I forced myself to go out there  I couldn't manage it every day  but I tried as much as I could  Eventually it got a little easier  but I'm not going to lie and tell you I was cured  Perhaps just start small  if you hear someone out in the kitchen  go out and get some water  look in the fridge  say hi  then go back to your room  Keep on doing it until eventually  hopefully  it is easier for you  Just little by little start interacting more  and hopefully you'll get more comfortable  If all else fails  do you think you could stand forcing yourself to eat a meal with them very now and then  I think you can definitely live a meaningful life as a recluse  if that's what you meant   You should adopt something that make it worthwhile at least though  an art  If anything being alone gives you a lot time to work on what you love most  It sounds like anxiety to me  And my guess is that you don't feel anxious when working exercising sleeping because you're distracted  So when you start to feel anxious  perhaps try distracting yourself with something  Or mindfulness meditation  It works for some people   What are your triggers  And did something specific happen in 7th grade to start it all  Sometimes knowing the root cause reasoning makes it easier to deal with  Once I figured out where mine came from  I found it easier to accept that I had it  and then didn't beat myself up about it so much   I totally understand this  Anxiety does seem like a huge bully  just like a horrible parrot siting on your shoulder whispering all these negative things and ruining my day  Have you tried any visualisation or meditation or anything to try and get rid of these feelings  Like some people imagine their anxieties as sticks floating down a river  or like waves carrying their anxieties out to sea  Other than that  have you seem your doctor  or a therapist  Do you take any medication  I suffer from health anxiety  yes  Googling certainly does not help  Have you seen a doctor about this  I don't really have triggers all that much but whenever somebody gets upset at me even in the slightest it normally triggers an inner dialogue with myself that escalates to then point of causing a panic attack  Most of the time though its just a constant feeling of heightened anxiety with spikes throughout the day  I guess in 7th grade is when I realized that my friends weren't the kind of people I liked  they aren't bad people its just I simply stopped liking them  I still am in contact and friendly with them just not friends  I do have a good group of friends now though  The past month though its been taken to a new level because I've been having hallucinations  I think the hardest part of this is growing up I've been constantly told by my mother that shit like depression  anxiety  and adhd are fake and made up so people can get drugs I actually believed that too until pretty recently when I've really started to question everything  Have you tried explaining your anxiety to your friends  And asking them to lay off you a little  Or instead of ignoring them and looking like a pussy  your words  how about just laughing it off   If by non stop you mean everyday or multiple times a day you are more than likely addicted  Benzodiazepines are intended for extremely short term or occasional use  Depending on your dosage and other factors they will cause those types of side effects which in the midst of a panic attack those side effects are totally worth it   Talk to your doctor  maybe see a therapist  A slow titrate off of them including additional anxiety medication and or therapy can help a lot   The mod answered your question perfectly  But I'd just like to say that I'd love to hear some of your writing if you'd like to share  Feel free to inbox me    Ah  kk   glad to hear it     Check out rainn org for how to support a friend and some information on laws  Also feel free to share it with your friend  They have a online chat and over the phone hotline   Panic disorder is characterised by sudden intense panic attacks   GAD is characterised by excessive  uncontrollable an often irrational worry  Can be with or without panic attacks    My SA is mild and I started in a call center on the phones talking to customers but was able to move into workforce analyst and now I work for home full time and rarely talk to anyone on the phone  I only have high school and learned everything on the job  Being able to figure out excel is what really got me ahead   Sounds like a normal 4 years of high school to me friend  Listen the best advice I can give you is to not give a Eff what others think or say about you and be passionate  Smile  Do that and things will line up and next thing you know your bonkers with a gal who shares your same passion or is drawn to yours   Ah ok   so that explains the whole druggy comment  I'm sorry that your mother says things like that  that definitely is not helpful and untrue    Can you give me an example of the inner dialogue that goes on inside your head  What would be some of the things that you're thinking   I hope you don't mind my questioning  I'm just trying to get a better understanding of what you're going through     If she doesnt want to tell her parents  then dont tell her parents  This is about taking control over her life  She might not want to deal with the shame of other people knowing  All I can say is probably just be there for her and do what she asks   Wow  that's great   So happy for you   Happy New Year  I don't have any specific resolutions or anything  I worked a lot this year on self care  trying to learn what good habits keep me feeling grounded and okay  learning not to overextend myself when things are going well  I think I'll just keep on with all of that     Ive been reading and this seems like the right thing to do  Thank you  at this point id just like to be prepared for in case this gets out and she wants to pursue this legally  Do you know where I can ask for that  Holy crap  yes  The holidays have made me emotionally overextended  and super frustrated with myself for being so limited  I missed out on an entire family celebration because the thought of driving to another state was too terrifying  I had to duck out on half of another one because being around all the people  especially the kids  had me crying uncontrollably    And it sucks  and it doesn't make any sense  I'm supposed to be able to trust that my family and friends won't hurt me  I'm supposed to enjoy spending time with them  And I try  And I know I'm very lucky to have a family that is mostly decent  But I just get overstimulated so easily      I appreciate the questioning its helps me to talk about things a lot  The inner dialogue is pretty much just me reminding myself that I'm a burden and trying to get myself to calm down but that makes it worse and I always tell myself I have two more years of this and then I can leave it all behind but everytime I see that I don't think I can handle two more years  Ah so is living with your mother what's causing this   Your girlfriend is wrong  That is definitely sexual assault  and you have every right to feel however you feel about it  I'm so sorry that it happened to you      I'm glad that you reached out  and went outside of your normal support network when it failed you  There are other resources as well   like rainn  that can be super helpful for figuring out how to respond  and at the very least dealing with the emotional aftermath  Talking to someone who believes you and understands can be immensely helpful  You deserve to be listened to   Works wonders for me  That being said  just 2 3 of a pill of the lowest dose knocks me cold in 30 min no problem  jesus man  I always kinda knew that is was my family and shit but like  it just hit me hella hard  I know what I need and I've known for a long time but fuck its hard to have to wait two years to get it Are there any other family members you could stay with  Or any local charities agencies that may help you moving away from your parents if they're causing you to be this unhappy anxious   Thanks for your reply    It isn't getting easier  and now I have to bottle it in because I just keep getting yelled at or abused if I say something to anybody    I have been doing everything in my power to get some money so I am not on the street in a few days time  I have not been eating or anything    I was never  ever like this I am so confused  every morning I just wake up in a daze because this is absolutely f   ed  I was just cut off so instantly   I keep having panic attacks every night  they are annoying  I am doing everything in my power so that I can remain happy but nothing is working and everything reminds me of my job   This is truly the worst I have been  whenever I fell down like this before I was able to pick myself up again    There has to be something wrong with me if this keeps happening right   I feel like I am dealing with this on my own  which I am and I really hate doing it I hate having to be miserable all the time   I have looked into all options and my best bet now is to work but for cash and I have to save but I just need the money to come in on the asap so I can get to a new place    I am panicking as I type    dude I have never been in a worse place than I was on that day and they changed me for the worst I cant even smile because theres nothing to be happy about i look like a stone    ah theres no point in explaining    i just dwell in circles until the next panic attack strike   i really would like this to end and be over Not panic attack but anxiety and abnormal agitation about things average people don't even care about  I'm not thinking about problems for hours to take myself into panic  but it comes by itself  I don't even realize sometimes that my body is in panic mode and my speaking starts to stutter    It can lead to the feeling you are in a prison in your own body which is not good but you are definitely not alone  should be easier to cure than mental problems  I find that chasing the workout high helped  So every sweat sesh came with its own incentive    Not so good   my friends totally blew me off so I ended up getting drunk and watching TV with my immediate family  Could be worse though I suppose  thank you  I'm going to talk to my doctor when I go get some their stuff checked out     I wish I could do that but I know I can't  Family is out of my options because I don't want to put that unfair pressure on them  I can't make a scene out of this its just not who or how I am  I guess I'm just fucked unless I can get a psychiatrist who knows how to help  Thank you for the help man  I'm just gonna have to pull through for two more years  It just sucks that my mother constantly guilts me for wanting to move away as soon as I'm 18 and done with highschool  My brother is 19 and still here and they have a relationship so I guess that cool  I feel like an ass for leaving but I know shes only trying to guilt me into not leaving to make herself feel better and to make sure she has control over me  Thats the thing with her  control  She digs through my meds and questions me about everything  Didn't take my entire bottle of Buspar once because it was break and I was only ever awake for one dose and she flipped shit on me for lying to her and being such a piece of shit whos manipulating her and then started to wake me up at 2 A M just to force me to swallow a pill that I'll had to take again the second I woke up again on my own   Aww  Thanks again so much  Feel free to message me anytime     Thank you  I'll take you up on your suggestion and check out rainn  However I think I have to have a long talk with my s o tomorrow about where to go from here  I appreciate the response at such a late hour   Would there truly be a huge difference if you didnt have SA  Some people are just inherently introverted by nature and seek to avoid people as much as they can get away with   I'm one of those select few so my severe SA doesen't bother me too much  There's probably some reason why this grossly unsafe or whatever  but what the heck  my Facebook is a public profile and most people can see most things on it  It's not exactly secret   This is me a couple of weeks ago  overcoming OCD agoraphobia issues by going out to a caf for a nice slice of cake  Six months ago I was pretty much housebound and couldn't make it past my front door without a panic attack  so it's nice to recover enough to relax a mile away from my house  for an hour  in a busy caf   https   www facebook com photo php fbid 10100115742934261 set a 548184129681 68090 223001922 type 3 theater What happened was sexual assault  and it was not your fault  You have every right to be upset and how you're feeling is totally understandable    I'm sorry your girlfriend and other friends reacted so poorly  I saw in another response that you intend to talk to your girlfriend tomorrow  If that conversation doesn't go well  it may indicate that this relationship could impede your recovery and may need to end    I know it's hard to reach out to other people after being dismissed by people you thought you could trust  but if you have any friends or family you could maybe talk to or lean on that could be helpful  You don't have to even tell them what happened if you don't want to  You could just tell them something happened that upset you and you could use a little extra love and support right now    RAINN is a great resource  Some other resources for men include  1in6 org  survivorsuk  based in the U K   and livingwell  based in Australia     You aren't alone  Take care of yourself   Hah  I wish my new years resolutions were as ''easy'' as this one   '  I'm afraid this year won't be better just by hoping that it will  Time to start making small changes and the big changes will come    happy new year and all the best for the future  Last year I decided that I needed to join some kind of fitness group so that I can force myself to be around others and hopefully make friends  I decided to join Crossfit and it has made such a positive change to my life  I am still socially anxious and don't get out much but CF has given me a reason to get out of the house  I've gotten over my eating disorder  I've gained confidence  I've gained strength  and I have actually made some friends   I tried things like netball and athletics clubs but I stopped going after about a month  The CF community is second to none   the environment is so encouraging  I would highly recommend you trying it   I am so much happier in myself purely because of CF   sigh    I worked at a restaurant for the past 4 years  most restaurants have the hostess or someone else wipe down the menus when it's "slow"  It passes time and is efficient  I've noticed it in other restaurants when it's slow they normally have a bottle near their stand and wipe those things down  This is hopefully the standard for all restaurants but some bosses employers are different  I also always washed my hands like so much during a shift  I always felt all gross and germy  Happy New Years   hope you find strength and guidance in 2017  Yup I hate touching all these things  But I carry around a little bottle of hand sanitizer  so I can touch them if I need to and just disinfect my hands afterwards   Honestly  it's hard for me to internalize that it's irrational to not want to touch these things  or to disinfect my hands after touching them   because these things ARE objectively dirty  they've been handled by so many random people  some of whom are sick  or who use the bathroom without washing their hands   and I've worked in enough service industry jobs to know this stuff rarely or never gets cleaned  I've been dealing with this type of thing for a few weeks now  my stomach just hasn't felt right lately and of course my anxiety likes to exploit that  I've been trying to take steps in the right direction and keep telling myself that I've been extremely anxious with everything and anything involving my health in the last few months and that this upset stomach is just being caused by anxiety  I don't think I have any reason to suspect anything serious  and again i just try my hardest to tell myself that my health anxiety has probably just made me more aware of what are probably normal bodily functions with the anxiety making more unsettled then normal  But it's tough you know  Things such as stomach cancer are scaring me and has given me my first panic attack in a while  I was honestly doing so well with the panic attacks before today  Ulcers also crossed my mind  Every sensation i fell in my stomach sends me into an anxious state  I've even started confusing hunger pains with reasons to worry  my appetite hasn't been the best lately  But I'll continue to try make myself believe its my anxiety until i have reason for concern  Unfortunately  anxiety is winning by a landslide   You're very welcome  In my experience you rarely know whether or not you're suffering unnecessarily until you've stopped suffering  Good luck and feel better soon  EMDR might help  It means imagining the stressful event and moving the eyes right and left  https   www youtube com watch v dzrZCSwLANo It's different for everyone  I've found that different combinations worked at different stages  The first med I tried was Zoloft which worked brilliantly until it didn't    I've also tried lexapro  Wellbutrin  agomelatine  also known as valdoxan   abilify  and probably more that I can't remember  all at different times   I came back to Zoloft after about a 10 year break and it's working very well    My advice to you is keep an open mind and be very honest about your side effects and symptoms   I wish you the best   Just saw this   Just my two cents about the creative outlet   It can hard to verbalize feelings sometimes  That being said  Talk therapy helps a lot  Therapists are professionally trained to guide you  and they'll work with your personal needs    Let me know if you have any questions with it  I've been in and out of talk therapy for 80  of my life  hello   your anxiety and concerns are definitely worth mentioning to the relevant person at your uni  this could be an academic registrar  welfare supervisor  accommodation manager or whatever the university has  so that they can bare your needs in mind when allocating rooms  They might not necessarily be able to guarantee anything  but they have a duty of care to students and given that it's still so early in the process there should be plenty of flexibility  like universities have to house people they accept in clearing and that doesn't happen until after a level results day   Also get in touch with your student union  again their quality reaaaaalllllyy varies from uni to uni but they will be able to give you really specific advice about what provisions your particular uni has    And finally when you get to uni I promise you'll be absolutely fine   it is super daunting for everyone and everyone feels at least a bit of anxiety at some point  You'll be amazed at how quickly you adapt to everything and the how strong your new friendships will be  Also don't forget that you definitely are not alone whilst you're studying   universities all have incredible networks of counselling services  welfare structures etc etc that will be wayyyyy beyond anything you had at school  I did loads of research about all this before I went away for first time  almost 3 years ago now omg  and I found it really reassuring to know exactly who I could turn to no matter what my problem was    That turned into a bit of a random waffle but I hope it helped   basically uni has the potential to be literally life changing in the most positive of ways if you approach it with the right information and mindset         Engaging in other OCD rituals  doing heroin  ingesting copious amounts of sedatives  and dropping heavy objects on one's head all have similar effects    It's useful to keep the focus on actions  not relieving feelings or thoughts  Trying to avoid those feelings thoughts is what OCD is all about  If you take drugs so you don't feel distressed  that can lead to practicing OCD even more because you don't see feel a problem    It doesn't sound like you're connecting the shots of alcohol with the OCD attack  Do you see them as helping you get out of it  Not causing it  If somebody said that their door checking ritual doesn't make them anxious in the morning  it helps them calm down  what would you think about that   If somebody got an injury while running in a race and then chugged a few shots of whisky and gotback in the race  Maybe they wouldn't feel the pain from the injury anymore  But they're doing the same thing that caused the injury  Whether they feel it or not is irrelevant  they're making it worse  They'll experience even more pain later    I would do the swimming again  When it comes to working out its best to do something you enjoy since you're more likely to stick with it  You can do it  You just have to force yourself to do it  Cause the self you are right now isn't never going have a day where you feel good enough to make new good habits  You have to force them to happen cause then in the journey you'll begin to feel better   If it really helps you should try the oil in the long term not sure about the dose and     doesn't damage your lungs and brain not sure about the 2  one  I developed mine  Growing up I was very out spoken  Then a series of traumatic things happened that made me take a back seat to my life  I had my SA ever since 8th grade   I couldn't even finish the half college cause of it and got disqusted by the jobs decent ones  with better salary than average jobs with diploma eastern EU   in a couple months  you got nothing to lose if you try  but if it's really bad then you need some kind of help  You took a small step  Keep taking those small steps and you will work your way out of this  I was were you are a few years ago  Got so worked up about posting online  I even found it hard to play online games as my  heart would start racing as I joined the game    It gets better 100  as long as you keep taking small steps   Happy New Year  Good on you for recognising who is at fault in this situation  I grew up in a similar environment and was brainwashed to believe it was my fault  It was very liberating to realise that the adults in my life had choices and were supposed to protect me   I applied because I knew it is where most people in IT start their careers  You learn a lot this way  I'm actually more comfortable face to face cause I feel I have more of a sense of control  But hopefully I can get used to this very soon lol  You are going through a tough time  I was there for 5 years  I sometimes look back and think 'what did I do for 5 years ' I barely functioned  lost a lot because of it  How did I get on the road to recovery  This is going to sound annoyingly simple but I just forced myself to 'do it ' I saw my choices as either remain a prisoner to SA and live a miserable life or face my fears and get back out there and make something happen  It really is that simple  It involves feeling uncomfortable  facing situations that brought about fear but the alternative  living in fear and avoiding everything  is much more scary to me   Two things that really helped me were mindfulness meditation and exercise  The meditation helped to calm all the harmful thoughts I had about myself and the exercise burned off adrenalin and cortisol and made me feel calmer    The only thing to do is put on your running shoes and workout  Do it today  What is the alternative  I guarantee after you work out you will feel 100 times better than if you avoid it for another day   Go on  Get it done   Edit for clarity  I still battle SA everyday and I still have bad days  I don't want OP to think I am saying it's easy  I know how hard it can feel sometimes  But no one can change it for you  You are in the driving seat  You can change  You will change  Everyone on here is dealing with anxiety  and thus  it's probably safe to assume that the people who reply do too  I know I've deleted mine in the past because I felt I exposed too much of myself  and despite that I might be helping someone  some "evil doer" might use my words against me  Grad school is hard  Anxiety can make grad school much  much harder  Being forced to drop out because you can't take it anymore can be devastating  Make sure you have a strong network of support  Why  You started by saying a hot chick was interested in you  and ended with that  What happened to make you feel that way  What a weird game it is huh  Thanks again    Mine developed for sure  Was about the most outgoing confident guy you could meet  In my early 30s I made some bad decisions  went through a traumatic experience and got myself stuck in a situation that was the final straw  I went from outgoing to paralysed with fear and doubts and couldn't even face my family   For me looking back a lot boiled down to how I felt about what I was doing with my life  When things fell apart career wise my confidence fell through the floor and things spiralled  Follow through with what  The girl  I don't know that this is really an anxiety probably or more of a nervousness shyness  Have you thought about maybe texting him  it writing him a letter  or something like that  Just because it's a new year doesn't mean things automatically change  it doesn't mean your problems magically go away  it's literally just the start of a new calendar year  it's just a new day  just as any other day is   Have you thought about seeking counselling to get things if your chest  rather than bottling them up  I made it onto the freeways today  Fighting with a long driving phobia I've slowly made it crawling to be able to drive around normal areas  that was hard but i've always avoided the freeways  Today I made it out onto them  I did 1 exit like 10 times  it was hard  I feel exhausted  but I hope it just gets easier from here  I'm not sure either  but since I have anxiety  diagnosed by a psychiatrist  not by me of course   I figured it also played a role  Maybe also what we call anxiety in french isn't exactly the same as in english   I've thought about this  but I feel like if I can't tell him face to face it's not right I don't deserve it  idk hard to explain and it might seem stupid  Anyways I just wanted to vent that out  thanks for the answer  If I'm busy when I'm drunk I'm good  Even symptom free  But once I'm alone like when I got home last night I was a mess  It almost seemed to double because I was drunk  I wanted to be sober really bad but obviously that isn't how it works lol    I normally end up focusing on my breathing then start to freak myself out  Then my symptoms increase a lot when I start panicking  Overall using drugs to mask OCD works personally but often makes things worse the next day for me  or after the party   Sometimes OCD still affects me when I'm drinking  sometimes it doesn't  It's a nice bonus if it doesn't    That said  I am starting to consider the theory that alcohol may make my OCD better at the time  but it may also mean the OCD is likely to be worse the following day  That sucks  it does  but life isn't all about getting chicks  I'm sure you have a lot more going for you  and a lot more to live for    Finally could meditate a bit with the guided relaxation from the FAQ after lost my motivation for it for months cause I'm pretty sure I got ripped off by the 400  "t    meditation"  I know absolutely nothing about these other drugs  but fwiw my cardiologist gave me propranolol  60mg 1x daily  to try to calm me down and control racing heartbeats  I haven't tried it yet since I'm kind of nervous to try any medication    Well actually I tried a 20mg pill of it once and it calmed me down but in this uncomfortable groggy kind of way  Hi all and Happy New Year with hope atleast   Answer to the question  not dreaming about my straight plan but doing it actually   I'm 26 from Hungary  everyone in my family got some kind of not extreme disorder  anxiety  depression  panic etc  Pretty sure I got some kind of GAD since I was 12 maybe  wasn't this bad at the beginning it was only in situations like when I had to speak in front of my classmates and ordering in restaurants even my speaking started to stutter   now from the moment I wake up until I try to sleep  it just comes without any long thinking and taking myself into panic  it's not panic attack but the feeling normal people got when they'll hear the most important news of their lifes and worse than that  feels like almost my open awakened mind is in solitary confinement  I can openly speak about it  searching for a therapist right now  sadly everyone I'm in contact with only worsens the situation  I've no idea how in all these years I not searched for this sub  I wasn't saying you didn't have anxiety  I'm obviously not qualified to say  No offence intended    You said he's shy too  so what if you both like each other  and you're both beating yourselves up for not telling each other  I think if someone gave me a letter poem text saying they liked me  and were a little shy to tell me face to face  I wouldn't think they didn't deserve me  I'd honestly be flattered that they pushed past their insecurities to tell me  I think you should go for it  Like you say  you both chose to spend New Years together instead of with anyone else  and I think that says a lot  Go for it  I'm sure you won't regret it  it could be the start of something awesome  And if nothing comes of it  at least you know and can move on  Good luck with what ever you choose    I have not changed my Profile pic from the last 4 years because of SA  Mediocre  Definitely not  that is awesome   Well done you  that's an achievement    I think it's definitely hard to do things once you've been disheartened  but definitely we should keep on trying  as you have   Why does it keep you up at night  Because you don't find that sort of existence fun  There are plenty that don't  my friend  I am with you on this one  I don't find that kind of life appealing either   How come  Hope you get better soon cause this sucks    Why wouldn't you be able to get medication and keep it hidden  You're 18  it's your body  your choice   Hey and good vibes all    I'm honestly pretty glad I discovered this as I'm in a dark place atm  I'm just turned 21  from New Zealand  really into life  sports  science  music  Generally really chill dude  super positive and smart  I was until I majorly fucked up  and decided to try lsd  which gave me a huge panic attack   went into er   I was diagnosed with GAD since as I feel constantly out of it and mentally restless  I mentally can barely cope with anything now and constantly have anxiety  Honestly don't know what's wrong with me  but feel like my mind is shattered  Peace all  atm i'm just trying to find things to stay positive about  e g  being alive  I don't think you are being over sensitive  I think everything in your post is relevant and spot on  I've only been using this sub for a few days now  but I can honestly say that this seems like the place when you can voice your opinions fears problems and not be judged  I feel like this is a safe zone  no judgment  labelling or laughing here   And I am sure they do  You said you have friends  this girl was interested in you  so surely she must have enjoyed your company  If you are worried about it speak to a counsellor or therapist for a proper diagnosis   It does sound like some kind of anxiety issue though  yes  Comgratz 2016 first year vomiting n stomach pain started for me  Look  I'm sure you have heaps to offer and lots of girls would love to get to know you  But as lonely as being single can be  relationships aren't the be all and end all  Have you tried dating  online or otherwise  That makes 3  Broken link  Aw no  I thought that one would go   Hmm  Maybe it's the Facebook privacy settings  Well anyhoo  Happy New Year to you  and I hope you too will enjoy using the prospect of delicious cake as a carrot on a stick to encourage you to overcome problems getting out and about  THE CAKE IS WORTH IT heh     Happy new year and congrats on taking the first steps towards improving your health   Doing it anyways  Even if it makes us look like a total social idiot   Hi  Ilnetaevre  Happy New Year  and congratulations on rocking that resolution  First steps are always really hard  so good on you for taking them  It's really great that you're working together with your doctor  too  and I can imagine that wasn't easy to begin with  either  Keep up the good work   Personally  I don't really know anything about modelling  but I'm sure there's a subreddit for it  And tons of them for video games  of course  Oh I misunderstood  I'm sorry  So you mean like wasting your time in life  Well I will say everyone worries about that  It's a big subject  Can you give us more context  What made you think about this topic  Yep  Find yourself some different friends  buddy  Depends on your age group  but you can find a lot of people into things other than drinking  getting high  getting laid  etc   I always think that looking at what you do for hobbies is the best place to start  A lot of times you can find clubs or meetups for those things locally and meet people there  Thank you so much   At least I'm not the only one ahahahah This was the year that I decided to avoid social media at all costs on both christmas and new years and it was the best decision I could have made  For the first time I could actually enjoy the situation and the people that were in front of me rather than comparing myself to what everybody else was doing   Well then how did you write this  Hiya  McDonalds employee of 2 years here   Obviously your Wendy's part spoke to me the most  Of course you felt shame at first  Society practically trains everyone to scoff at people who work jobs like that  But what I learned very  very quickly as someone who also had almost no work experience prior to McDonalds  is that the job teaches you healthy humility  resilience and the ability to work under pressure  IMO  these traits are extremely beneficial to someone with anxiety   What I mean by healthy humility is that you don't think low of or hate yourself  but rather respect for being able to work a job many others think themselves "too good" to do  Someone has to give these people their food every day  Someone has to clean the bathrooms  Someone has pick up trash off the roadways  Without them  it flat out  doesn't get done    I think you should try again  Maybe not at Wendy's but really at whatever job gives you the chance  Because if you stick with something and learn those traits  you'll become a respectable employee in time  I know exactly what it's like to show up to work at first and be terrible at your job and have managers belittle everything you do  Now  they're practically begging me not to go every time i announce a vacation   You haven't given yourself enough of a chance to declare yourself a bad worker  Give yourself a real chance to shine and make a living in life  I thought myself the same before I really decided I wasn't going to give up for a change  Put up with the crap that comes with the early days of a new job  and see if you can turn it around  I'm pretty certain that if someone like me can  you can too  I hope the same for you  I'm right there with you  Having a mini meltdown because of it as we speak     gotta love it   On my iPhone    And I certainly didn't indicate that any of this was rational  because it's clearly not  Also be careful the first time you try this for anxiety  I did this when I was 19  didn't know what type  and my heart started going 3 or 4 times a second  started freaking out so bad that streets seemed 100x as long as they were in reality    I've heard there are types that calm you down and types that hype you up  Personally I'm not a fan of this solution but if you consider it  please do your research before you end up in a panic attack   But I'm glad it helps you  OP      I am feeling better  thankfully  Nice quiet nite and home with hubby  I barely made it to 10pm  no ball drop for me  Did you make it  Ah yes doing good deeds in public i know how that feels when you have SA and feel some eyes looking at you  I have passed on doing some of those just because of the fear of awkwardness and having strangers looking at me  Try not to beat yourself too hard over this your family will let go of this incident pretty soon and you will have other chances to help others  If you get the occasion to be alone and you see some elderly person again i'd suggest that you go help that person even if you get the anxiety after you do it you will feel better about yourself i know this from own experience And besides there won't be too much convo either just "ah that's so sweet of you thank you young man" pretty much You just reply with "take care have a good day i'm glad i could help" and go to your business  Happy new year to you too    The thing is that I know they're not gossipping  My colleagues are all mature adults  not into emotional stuff or drama and they just do their job    It's more like I hear myself laugh with myself and my actions  but the 'evil inner voice' is using the sound of their voices  Does that make sense  I know it sounds weird but that's the only way I can explain it  No problem    It can happen to everyone  Like u folgaluna said  check out rainn org for how to support her  That being said  if she doesn't want to proceed with charges  or tell her parents  that's entirely up to her  I would support her and encourage her to tell them and to press charges  but I wouldn't pressure her  However  the sooner she presses charges the more likely she will win the case in my experience  Good luck  I was 'laid back' as well  but it was me avoiding all responsibility and thoughts of the future because of that feeling of anxiousness you get    When I was about to graduate  or start my own company  or make a big change I would be horribly stressed   I had to learn to recognize and deal with my anxiety in the good times to avoid getting really bad sometimes  You did a good thing by going at least you had some fun which is nice  I tell you one thing nobody cares on NYE about what you said and how you said it most likely a good part of the people that were there got drunk ate some food and then went to bed so don't beat yourself up over this  I know how it feels when you get home and over analyze but i wouldn't worry too much on special ocasions like this people have other things in their minds in those moments and even if you said something awkward they will forget it by the time they get up  Thanks for the suggestion  What's the difference between regular CBT and DBT  Can I do this by myself at home  I already see a therapist and we do some form of CBT and I don't want to change the therapy midway      Another year of being a kissless friendless virgin    Well  that's up to you  Thank you for the support  It's just nice to know that someone else understands  I think I get what you mean and that I'm going through the same thing  If I may ask  what kinds of thoughts are running through your head    Sometimes I feel like the world is spinning clockwise  when I'm just sitting in the couch at home  mostly when I have anxiety  The first time I thought I accidentally got drugs in my food or something  Is that similar to what you feel   i hope day 1 has already proved a success for you and that each day gets easier   Lots of people understand xx i think you said a really important thing   "consciously reaffirming that my symptoms are from anxiety"  ultimately  what "we" are all dealing with is anxiety      and that is what is happening to us  not symptoms of a heart attack  but a symptom of anxiety   Not sure if I actually hate humans  yes  yes  yes  i just stumbled across this sub after trying to find a cure to kick the anxiety in 2017  its very frustrating being the parent and child of your own brain  telling yourself youre going to be ok  verse telling yourself that everything bad is happening  exhausting  im with you for the rant  health anxiety is the worst   Well if they have SA it's probably the easiest to approach woman on Internet knowing she has the same problem  Dreaming of rescuing you  accepting you and all that hopeless stuff  A suggestion inspired by my therapist  Before you can get to any of those places  you have to know where they are   Make a list of the things you  would  be doing if anxiety were not getting in the way   These don't have to all be gigantic "find my soul mate" kind of things   One of the most mundane items on my list is to hire an electrician to get a range top microwave installed   Once you have the list perhaps you can identify one of the more 'doable' things at your current comfort level   Maybe there is a way to make some small progress there   Or discuss the list with your therapist or somebody else you trust  Sigourney Weaver plays an agoraphobic in the movie 'Copycat'  You did gud  Went better than expected  Next time you should get to pick a restaurant  Wait    Parents are always awkward  Uhm    10 hours into the new year  by East Coast US time  you have successfully completed your new years resolution  Now you can do nothing for 364 5 days   I went almost the whole night last night without having bad anxiety at my friends New Year's Eve party  I started to panic towards the end of the night but I was drunk enough to go to sleep  so I did   Pleasantly strange  oldschool cool  that's what they are  Makes you cool  100  I've developed such a routine in life due to anxiety and social anxiety that I go to work 40 hours a week and come home and hang with my family on weekends and weeknights  The thought of starting a relationship is hard because that means fornme breaking my routine when that's all I've known for about 5 years now   relatable  Happy new year   You sound like you're taking some solid steps into helping cure your anxiety in 2017   go you       Good job for posting here  Happy New Year   Can you see what has changed in the time when you went from being laid back to getting extremely stressed   You surroundings  your friends  your lifestyle  even food can have a tremendous effect on your thinking  which might have resulted in the shift of how you deal with things on a daily basis  congrats  really brave of you  Thanks for the advice man  I will start working on the inner voice as well i'm sick of being controlled and put down by it every time i want to get something done  I will look into electric stimulation as i have heard a lot of good things about it  Replaced the sugary stuff with fruit for some months now and i have lost a lot of weight Also i do bike alot when the weather is warm In my case the motivation is a mild acne and occasional breakouts that i have on my face which suck but they have somewhat disciplined me to eat healthier  Best of luck to you too  He understand that  he even knows that is maybe a coping mechanism  but he cant tolerates anymore  I understand  I only ask him for patience  but he doesn't have too much for me at this moment  so my relationship I like or not  are at the abyss at this moment Where do you live  To those with this delima let's do an experiment  Ask yourself what would you do if you was the boss of your own life  Write that question big  And Everytime you feel anxious or depress write it under that question  Eventually you will have a list of things you like to do if you were in control  That's step 1   Step 2 is asking yourself how will I get there from the first list  Step 3 is upon looking at each entry ask yourself is or was it will it be worth it   Well done man  the only posts I've made on here lasted about 2 minutes before I have to delete them   Thank you for the kind words    You were extremely lucky when you met your husband i am yet to meet the one but first i need to change my mindset indeed improve myself and then put myself out there more and be outgoing so i can have a chance  I would like a somewhat introverted girl like i am but it's hard to meet people that are alike because the introverted people are harder to find since they are more in "the back" making it more difficult to meet them  What I used to do was go to events where I knew nobody and just try to become comfortable with being uncomfortable  I know that sounds weird  so let me explain  I would go to a bar or club and just sit there alone and not try put unnecessary pressure on myself by needing to come across as "likeable" or "cool" or whatever  Just sitting or standing there alone and becoming aware of what thoughts and emotions are going through me  So when I felt uneasy    I noticed it and just allowed it to be there  The interesting thing is that after a while  when you allow the feeling of discomfort to be there    it no longer is discomfortable  And you will start to see that everyone  although they might come across as relaxed and comfortable  is far more occupied with afraid of how people are judging them  than with judging you  Once you are able to be ok with feeling that discomfort then it becomes much easier to connect with people  I think i have missed some good occasions when i've said no to people or certain events This year i will do my best to convince myself to get a job maybe an internship and go out more if i have the occasion  After i've developed SA it was hard to go out and try new things because i was supposed to get out of my "bubble" and i chose the easy way but as more time passes i'm getting disappointed at myself for not doing anything new and always having the "sleep university come home and stay at the PC sleep repeat"  You said you don't wanna touch phones    lol     same Yep i have realized that if i do something productive i do it for myself and i do believe that once i get to a certain point and i'm happy with my own being i will start becoming more positive and maybe then i will attract more people around me maybe even a SO  I was also thinking of starting doing some calisthenics daily as a way to get disciplined and get myself in the mood I know that once i start doing something productive it becomes a habit after a while the thing that is the hardest is just the starting point cause i have to convince myself to do it I'm planning to convince myself this year because i have wasted so much time that i have become a ghost and i'm starting to get sick of the boring life with no purpose that i'm leading right now  I have started reading a book on procrastination as that's my biggest problem which is caused by my SA It's called "Eat that frog" by Brain Tracy it has got some good ideas and principles that i want to apply  After i'm done with that i want to read some more books on SA included cause i know that reading about your issue does help  This happens nearly every time I drink  which is why I don't too much anymore  I always just try to remind myself that a couple days from now these fears will be long gone  it calms it a little bit  Don't say that get some help instead There are are things that can heal you be it therapists books meditation or medication  Instead of finding the courage to commit suicide why not find the courage to start making a change for the better     Take care of yourself dude  I get what you're saying i am too believing that you have to be in a shitty place to realize that you want to truly get out and become better Been like this for several years now i'm getting sick of it So i will really push myself to make a change  I have set some small goals and i will also write them on paper to remind myself every day when i wake up I have started eating healthier since last summer and i have seen the effects The next thing is to start taking small steps in working out  Well   I can't say that I've ever been good with Excel  What kind of call center do you work for though  I feel like that would be an interesting job  In some ways talking on the phone makes me just as anxious as talking to people face to face  But in other ways  it might be more manageable   So what if you are bisexual  lol  I see nothing wrong in it  even if you are straight  sometimes you can get a little "gay" lol     That's me at least  you can be straight  just a little more open minded  Thankyou Thanks for the advice i have looked into cross fit and i liked what i saw Seems like an interesting and interactive form of workout  I might give it a try if i find a decent gym that does CF  If i could make some friends as well at the gym like you did i'd have absolutely no problem with motivation  Glad to hear that it has made a positive change in your life best of luck to you and keep going     Have you talked to your boyfriend about your feelings  Thank god  Thank you for answering  D habe a nice day dude also thank mr skeltal for good bones and calcium Wish I had that feeling  Everytime I get a text it's the feeling of  "Oh great  now what " or "Who's asking for a favor now "  I'd much rather have a phone call anyways  Gets the conversation done in one minute of talking as opposed to five ten minutes of texting  Plus you avoid the whole "Did they get my text " feeling too  Thank you for the motivation I will definitely try meditation as i've been suggested so by multiple people including here  I have too grown sick of being a prisoner to SA and doubt so i have to adopt the mindset that getting out of my comfort zone is good for me and just do it After all nobody can do it for me as you said and i don't want to keep living a monotone life forever so hopefully this thought will be good enough to get me going  Good luck to you too  Stayed at home  ate pizza  hung out with My SO and our kitten  Also watched Magnificent 7  Perfect anti social night    You can develop SA indeed I too was outgoing and more confident when i was younger a kid basically  but after some negative experiences that made me doubt myself and lose my confidence i have  become trapped in this "bubble" for so long now that it has become a habit to stay in it and avoid any situation that forces me to get out of it  The more time passes the more you become engulfed in it and the monotone lifestyle of being socially anxious becomes something normal  I am a teacher  As you can imagine SA caused me to leave my job  After a few years I am teaching again  You can escape SA  The key is whether you really want to  Dig deep  accept that you will face some uncomfortable moments  take one day at a time  When you have a bad day just leave it behind and focus on the progress you have made   Good luck  Same here  I really want to try improv and hope that it will help with SA  I feel exactly the same way   This is so me  We must be the same person  p It could be nocebo effect   you assume the generic will be worse as it's cheaper not branded  so you feel a negative effect  I get what you're saying and Rowling's words have me some hope as well I am aware that i am currently stuck in a bad place but i do hope for the best in the coming year and that i will have the mindset to change for the better NYE and Christmas are somewhat normal days for me because i really don't do much except have a meal with my family and then stay at the computer or watch a movie but i do see alot of happy people around me that are happy with themselves in this time of year and it kinda makes me reflect on what i have done for myself therefore making me disappointed in myself because i have wasted so much time because of my anxiety I want to change that in 2017 so i can be happy with myself as well at the end of the year Christmas and NYE will still be normal days for me but hopefully with a positive reflection on my actions  I get this to an extreme with my boyfriend's family  If there's an occasion  I ask him not to say "Can Ash come " because they may feel pressured into saying yes  If they want me there  they'll say "Invite Ash if you like"  If I'm not invited without prompting  then I'll be very reluctant to go  four  Why  Why do you two feel that you have to come  Hello  Welcome here  You've done great by posting your feelings here  You are welcome to talk about anything here when your SA acts out and you want to vent out  You will always be accepted here  you are safe here     Lets try discussing to get you at ease and comfortable here  you don't have to answer if you don't feel like it    What are you studying in university  I'm studying software engineering and I'm currently doing an internship at a big AAA game company as a gameplay programmer  If you're learning C  just to learn more about other professions  I tip my hat to you  Programming isn't always easy  it has a steep learning curve at first  but it gets easier once you understand the jist  Do you like it   What kind of music are you writing  On what kind of instruments is it supposed to be played  I'm currently learning electric guitar  and it is fun as hell   What games do you play  Are you more of a console or PC gamer  I spend a lot of time gaming too  on PC   Have a great year  Make of 2017 the year you get what you want out of life    We have talked about it many times  He understands the fact that I don't like it but he asked me to bear with it once a year  Which I consider reasonable  I live in a country where every holiday means going out all the time  I just need the courage to do it   I keep telling myself this whenever I start romanticizing about how it might be nice to get into a relationship lol I understand how ERP can be done for compulsion  I can do that  But I couldn't understand how to do ERP with intrusive thoughts which don't lead to compulsions but just keep on repeating themselves  Any suggestion  I don't expect my problems to magically go away  I work very hard to try and overcome what I'm dealing with  it's more the symbology of New Years  the representation of a new beginning that I find upsetting  I do go to counseling  it has helped somewhat  but overall I'm not feeling any better   I took it last night  and was still up  tossing and turning  Hoping that tonight it works  I had eaten a lot before taking it  so maybe that affected the results   I know exactly what you mean  Just practice not reacting   Interesting I had plans with my family to go watch the new year fireworks  but they invited the neighbors over after supper and cancelled our plans  I tried to hide in the background  was told it was very rude  I tried to fit in and felt very uncomfortable all night  And eventually  I tried to sneak out to see the fireworks without anyone changing my initial plans and assert what I really wanted for me  and I only had an argument with my mother about being alone on NYE just for fireworks  but fuck    they change my plans all the time  How do you mean  Like not giving those thoughts attention  How can I practice that  They're in my head and if I just let those thoughts pass by  there are still hundreds of other negative thoughts that pass by continuously    So any tips are welcome Please don't take this as an attack  it isn't meant offensively  I'm quite sure I'd be in a similar position myself if my boyfriend broke up with me  Maybe I should listen to my own advice     It sounds as though you're using relationships as a crutch to deal with your own problems  Everyone has to have a crutch to get them through the bad times   religion  food  gaming  people  drink  drugs  again  this isn't an attack  people are also my crutch   Now obviously it's healthier to be reliant on a person rather than something harmful like alcohol food binging  But the problem with relationships is a lot of the time they aren't forever   and that can leave you vulnerable when your crutch is pulled from under you  I would perhaps recommend you find some coping strategies on your own  and get a little space from your partner for a while to ensure that  you can be ok on your own   I had a break from relationships for almost a year and began to rely on friendships instead  which can be a lot more stable   It also sounds like you may be putting too much on your boyfriend  Some people can't deal with mental health problems  and we as people suffering with them  shouldn't inflict anything on others they can't deal with  If you love your boyfriend  of course it would be hard to let him go  However  you should also want him to be happy and what's best for him   If after discussing his needs and your needs  you don't feel like they can be aligned or fulfilled   you may have to accept that at least at this point the relationship cannot continue  Not "never"  just  not now   Ask your boyfriend to write a list of qualities traits about you he thinks are 'you'   and how these change when you take on this new 'personality'  This way  you can focus on particular aspects next time you're in one of these social situations   Finally  even if you don't mean to  it is manipulative to use your suicidal thoughts to stop him from leaving you  If you are in crisis or feeling in any way suicidal  please ring the emergency number in your country or go to your nearest emergency department  Our illnesses can make us selfish but for those we really love the real us can shine through   I really hope you can talk through what needs to be talked through  and work things out  But please try to lessen your reliance on him  for your own sake   exercise  engage in a hobbyist group  join a church buy a Bible  or whatever religion you follow  I often wish I was religious so I could do this    go out with friends   do  something   Best wishes  2017 is  our year   be aware that they are just thoughts  but you are above them and can disregard them if you want to  with practice this works    Or if you can just put in some headphones in work and don't listen others  Just focus on the music instead     It's like a muscle  Gotta practice   You could try r legaladvice  but generally speaking the absolutely most important thing you can do is listen to her  support her and believe her   It is likely that when and if she tells people about what happened  they will treat her badly  and it's very important that her good friends counteract that  Welcome     It always amazes me how many of us are out there   I taught for a few years as well and even though I was not in the mental health profession or teaching that subject matter   it still became apparent that my students needed help in that area  Hey there   It is NOT okay that he did this to you   Being drunk and saying you don't care is not consent   Think about it this way   if you were there with a friend and you talked to them about sex and they were suicidal and said "I don't care"  what would you do   You'd get them a damn blanket and some tea   Not take advantage of them   Is it possible to talk to your boyfriend about this   You should not have to deal with this attacker in your home  Happy new year   Nope  I didn't make it either lol  I think I fell asleep around 11 00   I am going to visit some family later on today   Yeah that sounds like rape to me Just go into therapy  while talking with a psychologist you won't just do ERP  if they have a therapist degree well they must know a lot of therapy types and techniques that  s he will use for you  the one who works the best for you you will keep using  I also get these 'panic attacks without fear'  although they're rare compared to regular panic attacks   Sometimes I can be lying there shaking like a leaf  and suffering chest pain and palpitations  laughing awkwardly and apologising to my boyfriend because I don't really know what's happening   I've found they are dealt with in the same way quite effectively  being held and regulating my breathing  Congratulations  Best of luck for your two year streak  I ate healthier basically  More protein foods like chicken and turkey  more salads with low fat dressing  I've been considering therapy for a while for my depression  but with all this going on it's probably a good idea to just go for it  Everyone needs a crutch for their anxiety   whether its something damaging like drink  drugs of binge eating  or something 'safer' like friends  religion and hobbies  I'm glad you found something that helps to take the edge off   and hope you'll use this as a stepping stone rather than a conclusion   I don't want to sound like a nagging mother but for the sake of your health  I would try to find something less damaging you can transition to as a crutch  This could be a slow transition by all means  but I wouldn't want to rely on it in the long term  Best of luck  Make sure you eat  Taking antibiotics on an empty stomach is a bad idea  What I do if I am on antibiotics is kind of bury it with food  usually oatmeal is my go to  So I would eat about half of the bowl of oatmeal or whatever you choose to eat   take the meds and then finish the food so there's plenty in your stomach  otherwise the antibiotic will irritate your stomach  Good luck  you will be fine   One thing to try    disrupt your thoughts of stressing over what you said by getting out a piece of paper and writing down every single thing that went right  Every tiny little thing    You have already mentioned some    you actually went out even though you were anxious  you did well in moderating feelings of anxiety while you are at the event  you had a good time while you were there        etc    It sounds like you had some conversations   great  It sounds like you stayed there awhile too   awesome    Make as long of a list as you can of things that went well   Congratulate yourself   this took courage   Good job    My main goal for this year is going to a psychologist and opening up   What about you OP     Yay   congratulations on your little victory    I met my now long term partner on Tinder  and have a few friends from there too  As an anxious person I found the almost anonymity of it quite relaxing empowering  Try to keep as much personal info off your profile as possible  ie  don't connect your instagram    and you'll feel a lot more anonymous and hopefully a lot less anxious  Best of luck with your search  get a hobby that requires you to get stuff from outside  Like cooking    or start liking tattoos or piercings  So you'll have to got out and get them  I am a sufferer or anxiety and depression and I have to leave the house to atleast get new piercings   D Yea  right before bed is my scariest time  Somehow submitting to the loss of control that is sleep is terrifying  Thank you for asking    I've been giving this a lot of thought over the past few weeks leading up to 2017   I help people overcome social anxiety  so my goal this year is to help as many people as I can achieve real change in their lives  I know what works but figuring out the most effective ways to share this with people who need it in a way that they will believe in and actually try can be a challenge    I was super alone on NYE too  I felt a bit weird and sentimental st times but otherwise it was perfectly fine   Yep  I would have done the same thing until that was confirmed  Have a great day   Happy new year    And always remember your hygiene that'll help protect you from all sickness     It seems that she played me  She's blocked me on everything and hasn't responded to any of my messages  I'm just heartbroken  I really though we had something  Sounds like you're off to a really good start  Well done on the weight loss   The critical voice is irrational  so what I I'd was counter it with rational thoughts  It gets easier over time   I'm making good progress   bolted from my job in communications to a Master's programme abroad to sort myself out  It's an expensive but effective solution   For what it's worth  keep up the good work  Assuming like most of us  you don't have any reason to fear imminent death  and that this is just a general long term concern     yes  the concept of not existing is extremely terrifying to me  Somehow  many people especially as they get older come to peace with this    maybe they're just tired from life  or their religion gives them promises of afterlife  For the rest of us  I think we just willfully and naively ignore the looming tragic reality of death   otherwise we could not even get through the day  not function at all  because we'd know that this is all just hopeless    I also sometimes get that overwhelming feeling of insignificance  Usually it comes for me on long distance flights  in the middle of the night when everyone else is asleep  and we're flying over uninhabited ocean or the arctic  hours from any human civilization   Hey  Don't worry at all about vomiting from antibiotics  I hate taking them because no matter what with an empty stomach or full stomach I always get diarrhea from it but that's just me  I have a sensitive stomach  My words of advice  IF you get diarrhea  REMEMBER it is from the antibiotics because they kill the good bacteria as well  if you do get it  it will have NO correlation to stomach virus or throwing up  You will be absolutely 100  fine  Hey man  Wanna talk on messenger or iMessage    Also suffer a lot and wouldn't mind someone to talk to  Cheers I agree I have the same problem  Night time was worse for me and that's what prompted me to go on medication for my anxiety  What caused such an issue with medication  Maybe sit down and tell them the extent of your anxiety  I would be a zombie and never sleep without mine  It's your body  your decision  I'm sure they'd want you to be happy rather than miserable    I gave up alcohol  reduced caffeine  reduced fried food  reduced spicy food  reduced dessert  But I also tried to up my caloric intake because I was losing more weight than I wanted to  And I tried eating high protein breakfast  like eggs or yogurt  to give me a boost before work  Anyway none of this seemed to have any effect on my health anxiety   That's really  really kind of you  You're a great person for helping people with social anxiety  I honestly thought people like you wouldn't exist anymore in this society  Anyways  I hope you'll reach your goals  thank you     I have spent the last 6 New Years home alone with my family  and it's honestly the best  NYE celebrations are overrated and recovery is most important  Putting pressure on yourself to go out or feel that you're missing out just makes it worse  I'm so glad you didn't have anxiety about it this year  It's totally ok to spend New Years alone  It really is just another day   Wow  this sounds very professional  Everything in this song is so true  and I'm sure everyone on this sub can identify with it  Thank you for this wonderful piece of art  Which medication helped you  My doctors haven't suggested anything specific yet and I'm kind of nervous to go on any meds    Anxiety is a bitch  my last job lasted about 8 days before I left  I just couldn't get myself to deal with all the stress  But there's hope  I'm going to see my doctor this week to see what can be done  Have you tried getting help therapy  I wish I knew how to get help for this  Maybe talking about it with someone  maybe not ignoring it  maybe familiarizing ourselves with it more  Though I'm afraid that understanding the reality of it would actually trigger more anxiety  I wonder if sometimes being in denial actually protects us from anxiety   Thank you  There are many awesome people on this forum  I'm glad to hear you are taking steps to achieve your goals    hope you keep us informed about your progress  Very best of luck in the new year Thank you  It's comforting to know someone feels the same way  Flying is one of my triggers too   I usually try to calm down eventually  but sometimes this fear also manifests in complete obsession about death  Whenever there's a massive incident involving a lot of deaths  plane crashes for example   I'll spend hours and hours trawling through live feeds to read about morbid details  It's really sick       Edit  Ahh sorry still new to reddit so I deleted my comment by accident  It is not your fault that they are miserable  I'm sure it's very hard to live in that situation   unfortunately I don't have very good advices cause I ended up not visiting home for many many years after I was able to move out  But I also saw therapist which was a great help for me  Hang in there  i hope you find the answers you need   I do try to talk to my partner about it but he's one of Those "rational thinkers" that see it as normal part of life  and I'll get the "It's still far away so just live a good life" pep talk  Which isn't comforting at all when you're freaking out    I was thinking about seeing a psychologist   psychiatrist about it as well  although I feel kinda stupid going for something so minor when there's other people out there who have bigger problems than an existential crisis  You can outgrow it  When I was in high school the mere mention of the symptoms of any disease would give me panic attacks and I threw up on more than one occasion from worrying about illnesses I'd convinced myself I had   Now  I occasionally find myself worrying about something because I do have certain mild health problems that aren't identified  but it's just usually a passing thought and not something that I dwell on or panic over    One thing that helped me was treating my anxiety in general  I quit smoking  I quit drinking caffeine  I cut way back on drinking  started exercising again  and I eat much healthier now  These aren't cure alls  but I found the combination lowered my anxiety dramatically and helped me approach things more clearly  I also tried some medications that I didn't end up liking  but that can be an important part of getting better too that's worth trying  Of course if you can afford it therapy is also a great resource  but the above are things you can do immediately that can have a noticeable impact   I wish you luck in overcoming your health anxiety  and just remember that it IS possible  You don't have to suffer from this your whole life    Since there was an Askreddit thread about this not too long ago   I gotchu   http   imgur com a wzsQm    The one with the tape on my fingers was taken during finals week to help stop me pulling my hair out lol  Hi  Thank you so much for your response and kind advice  I really appreciate it and it's very helpful    I have tried little bits of yoga exercise and meditation  and you're right that when I tried them that it seemed to help a bit   I think I will try doing these things again with more regularity and consistency  I think I give up on them and get frustrated for some reason but will persevere    I will also keep the medication advice in mind too    thank you again for your response and for sharing your experience with anxiety and losing temper  I appreciate knowing I'm not the only one who struggles with this   I used to think 'i don't want to commit suicide  but I'd be fine with not waking up tomorrow so at least that way it's no one's fault that I died ' it's a permanent answer to a temporary problem   I say temporary because you can get help for these thoughts  I don't know where you are  but I'm the UK and I phoned a free crisis helpline and spoke to someone who has anxiety and they told me what they do to cope  and worked through ways of what I can do to distract myself from these thoughts  They also connected me with some more long term help  CBT  and it's a long road  but I no longer have these thoughts  That was about rambly but hope it helped even a tiny bit  I don't know how to thank you very much for your words  it hurts  like the truth does  but the reality is that at this moment take distance is a good strategy at this moment  you gave me wonderful ideas and a way to afront this along with the therapy  Thank you very much Excuse my presumption here  but how   Who are you   Why are you collecting information   If you're as professional as you say  why are you using a free surveymonkey survey   Why didn't you bother to correct spelling errors before posting   This feels super suspicious and skeevy   Responders beware   Edit  OP   This is the place  https   www reddit com r ptsd comments 55d6x1 survey thread surveys posted outside this thread  st IXEZ91E3 sh 2d672a23  you are supposed to post surveys along with  info about who you are   Freaking awesome  man   This is how it starts for you  It's only going to get easier and better to post from here  Then on to more exposure  It's wicked uncomfortable  and even terrifying  Way to be brave  Ride this wave of support onto the next and keep killin' it  Happy new year  I take Effexor but the medication that helps me at night is called remeron  it calms and causes sleepiness   I also take klonopin at night as well I think the phrase intrusive thoughts can help you here  Simply put  they are intrusive  unwanted  and thoughts  not actions   I had a very bad episode of anxiety and panic attacks months ago that had me fearing going near knives in fear is hurt someone including my kids  It was extremely unsettling  I also  around this time  visualized myself walking right into traffic  I absolutely love living and have a decent life  but these thoughts just came   Id say if they continue for more then a few months  seek professional help  There is nothing wrong with talking to someone  As a veteran of a war  pride aside  it's healthy to be open  When you normalize your situation  it becomes very easy to live with it    Be well  Lol when the fear of leaving is this immense  no hobby will make a person leave   Speaking of piercings  I pierced my own nose  properly and with a real hollow piercing needle  years ago while having a panic attack  I almost fainted but it was some strange temporary distraction  Well  I did complete opposite this time  Last new year's eve  I stayed home alone playing video games and it was one of my best NYE's ever  This time I went to a friend's party  I didn't really want to go but went anyway  I didn't feel comfortable at all  All the drunk "happy" people dancing  trying to make me dance also    I felt soo big relief when I left the party  On one hand I'm glad I went because I left my comfortable space but on the other hand I didn't enjoy myself   Keep reading  Keep learning  Try new things  Follow what you like doing  Keep an open mind   You're young with a lot of life ahead  I'm 27 and still can't answer those questions  but I have learned a ton from the decisions I have made   Keep living  Buspar IMO sucks and not even worth filling the prescription  Propranolol is def better but  also comes with possible side effects  In a nutshell propranolol physically stops you from having a panic attack but  mentally   any intrusive thoughts will still be there  If you suffer from anxiety but mainly suffer with physical symptoms racing heart  hyperventilating  etc  then I would def recommend it  If you suffer mentally as well   a different medication would be a better option   Thank you so much  I know you are right  My title itself should tell me something lol  Sometimes it feels like I just need someone to day it too me  I really appreciate the response thank you  It helps just knowing there are people who have gotten through it  Thank you    For some reason  people with long fingernails really bother me  I hate being touched by them  hearing them tap their nails  or seeing them put their nails against paper  They seem so dirty to me because I know germs can get trapped under there  It makes my little sister really self conscious about her fingernails  Sorry to hear  There sure is someone who is the one for you  Don't lose hope  I hope too   If you're hallucinating  do you think it's more than OCD   Money and jewelry  I physically shudder when I have no option but to touch those  Edit   And fake finger nails    I like this  The fact that you snapchatted your boobs and flirted doesn't matter  at all  when it comes to the seriousness and legitimacy of him sexually assaulting you  Whether you report it is entirely your decision  it can be very positive or very negative for people  so it's important that you make that decision on your own   If you're comfortable doing so then talking to your guidance counsellor and or philosophy teacher could be beneficial  it can help talking to someone that you trust    Your are not to blame in any way  You are not dirty  Someone did something horrible to you and the blame is entirely on him  Thank you  Same to you  I already have 2 kids with him and I can safely say his sociopathic nature was definitely learned  It all depends on how the child is raised  My kids are exceptionally well behaved and intelligent  while his kids with multiple other women are not  because their mothers were either absent or just as bad as him  It does suck to look at a kid and see the face of someone you hate  but I learned its something you need to tolerate as a mom  just like one of my kids has a big birthmark on her face  You don't love your kids based on how cute they are unless youre a jerk  so who their father is is on you not them  Thank you for not being judgmental about me having another baby because its nice to know not everyone values a babysit right to life based on how much money their mom has   deleted                     0 9268      What is this   https   pastebin com 64GuVi2F 71073  I'm the same way  I'm pretty self sufficient and need very little input from people  but it had helped with my issues  We can surely get lost in our own head  Thanks  by the way  what is TOCD  i've always thought i was the only one  I've seen so many things on this subreddit that i can strongly relate to but i still never expected for something like this to come up   on topic  it really helps me to learn stuff  by repeating it untill i completely understand something makes it easyer to remember stuff  but sometimes it can be really frustrating because i can't get myself to stop repeating something  I still see it as a positive aspect of my OCD though  What about a family  When you're already old  it'd be nice if there were people who'd be thankful for you being their parent  taking care of you  helping out    It did  thank you  I was lucky enough to avoid huge crowds besides being in the nightclub but I found a spot right under the air conditioner so that kept me sane lol  Wait  what's ERP  I'm knew to the Reddit and the OCD subreddit so I'm still learning lots of terms  I don't think so  I have a very vivid visual imagination as it is  I think this is just my worries coming into that  So are you actually seeing things or is it your brain trying to convince you you're seeing things even though you don't visually see it  I wish I had an answer for you  But you do have my sympathy  My boyfriend is the same way  His friends are all the people we went to high school with  Mostly people I didn't get along with or didn't know  They're pretty crude and just moronic  Even he has said he wants to move on and get new friends but still he sees them and wants me to see them too  I know how you feel   Hey  just wanted to chime in and say that I'm going through something similar  I was recently promoted to front desk manager at the hotel I work at and I'm absolutely cracking under the pressure  I'm not even functioning as well as I was before I was promoted  The only way I've been able to manage is by saying "fuck it" occasionally and ignoring my responsibilities  but I would not recommend this as it just makes everything harder in the long run   I really want to quit  but I too am friends with management and don't want to let them down  I'm particularly close with the person I directly report to and she stuck her neck out for me to get this position in the first place  I think that they like me enough to protect me for a while  but I don't think I have it in me to do this job the way it should be done   Sorry I don't have any advice for you  but at least we're not alone  My goal is to smile and greet people when I see them at work for 90  of the time  That sounds like schizophrenia and not OCD or some combination of the two  Idk what psychology your gf and that nurse are studying but it's very different than what I've learned   This is like textbook schizophrenia  Hallo  I hope you can benefit from your partial hospitalization program like I  and many others I personally know  have benefited from ours    My psychiatrist also prescribed Abilify to add on to my antidepressant  generic of Effexor XR  as an enhancer thingy when I was at my partial hospitalization program  He saved my life when he prescribed it  and that is not an exaggeration  My antidepressant was working really well for me  but then it was losing its effectiveness  in my case  So  Abilify was added  Adding it has made a huge difference in how I feel  and I wouldn't have made anywhere near as much progress without it    As far as side effects go  the only side effect I experienced was increased hunger at higher doses  I'm on five milligrams now  which I believe is a lower dose  so increased hunger hasn't been an issue  Sorry if it feels that way  But I want those who have PTSD to not be offended  It's like a biological imperative to be social  even though it's not really what I want  So weird  It always makes me feel worse  You answered exactly zero of my questions   If you expect to gain our trust  start by following the the subreddit guidelines  https   www reddit com r ptsd about in a browser  or click "   " in the top right of the main subreddit page from the mobile app  Thank you very much for your kind and supportive answer  I've read about "toxic shame" as you mentioned and it quite makes sense indeed  I've never taken any meds   I was reluctant to and wanted to be able to manage by myself but I guess I was a little to optimistic or naive  I just wish I didn't have to carry that "burden" anymore  To be clear I had "accepted" it and didnot see it as such while resurrecting but everything feels like an ongoing struggle whose positive results are quite fragile and easily shattered it seems  I'm sorry   it's my exhausted self talking  Hopefully it'll get better and easier  And I will try again and "gather myself around my faith for the light does the darkness most fear" as one of Jewel's song said   I've heard it years go and I don't even remember which it is but it stuck with me   Thank you again for your answer and I wish you a very beautiful  happy and healthy new year strewn with joyful moments and beautiful souls  Hugs  I don't actually see things  more like in my mind's eye  Yeah  I was worried it was schizophrenia too  but I don't think it is  The primary problem I'm having is the obsessive thoughts of the world ending followed by checking news to make sure everything is okay  which leads to more thoughts of the world ending     And I just wanted to ad that I don't know what DBT et CBT are but I'm going to look into it  A year and a half ago I went to a cognitive psychologist but after 4 months we hadn't started with the cognitive therapy yet although I clearly insisted on it and said I no longer wanted to "have to" tell my story again and again  I think it's totally useless and makes you a prisoner of your own past and I don't want that  So I stopped  I guess some psychologists do not understand that you've already had enough with your past and just want to move on and try to manage its consequences to try and build your own life   ie that was stolen from us for a while   Have you told anyone about your hallucinations  Because yes  what you just described could be OCD  however  that behavior WITH the hallucinations is schizophrenia not OCD  The hallucinations significantly change the diagnosis  People with OCD have delusions   like believing the world is going to end  but not hallucinations  Schitzophrenia has BOTH hallucinations and delusions   thank you so so much  I worried so much that my flirting somehow takes away the legitimacy of the assault  thank you  and I think I will go to my teachers when the break is over Thank you very much for your answer flyonawall  Your analogy is an eye opener   I guess I sometimes demand too much of myself  I think I've accepted what happened and how it affected me but not yet as "an irrevocable part of me"  if it means sometimes being to "paralyzed" to do what I want to do  I guess I need to deal with my current frustration about this  Thank you very much and a very happy and beautiful year to you and your loved ones  this is good advice I'm going to try it myself  thank you   Hi  Sorry to hear about your struggles  Give yourself a lot of credit for reaching out and wanting help   I will copy and paste a guide I wrote about how to find a good  affordable therapist in the US  One second  let me find it  I also recommend starting with a primary care physician to get a check up done and a blood test ordered  These things can help rule out any potential causes or factors contributing to the way you're feeling like thyroid issues  hormone imbalances  and vitamin deficiencies  Keep in mind that seeing a doctor doesn't automatically mean you'll need to take psychiatric medication  nothing wrong with that at all though  I'm on psych meds myself    I also mean this respectfully  but would seeing a therapist be an option  as well  A therapist who is a good match for you can provide support  give you a private place to express yourself  give objective feedback on your situation  help you move forward   if you have any questions  like what types of questions you would be asked by a professional  how to prepare for a first appointment  how first appointments usually go  or my personal experiences with professional help   then don't hesitate to ask me  Feel free to send a message anytime   I've told my GP  occupational health nurse and my counsellor  None of them has suggested schizophrenia  Plus I'm not having 'real' hallucinations  as in actually seeing things   it's more like in my minds eye  I've sort of been able to make things appear in my minds eye whenever I want to as well  Thank you  It gives new leads and tools to use  Sometimes I just want to live   "free"     Happy new year  OK  found it  Part 2                                              How to find an affordable therapist in the US     There is a well known website called psychologytoday com that has a therapist finder and psychiatrist finder to locate professionals in the US  Here are the steps    1  Search online for psychologytoday com's therapist finder  Search by your zip code or city  or nearby ones  in the search bar of psychologytoday's search engine thingy    2  If you have insurance  look on the left sidebar to filter your search results by your insurance provider  If you don't have insurance  look at the bottom of this post because I address this    3  Hopefully after selecting your insurance provider  a list of professionals will come up  Each professional's profile should have their picture  what they specialize in  price  contact information like an email address or phone number  etc  The information you'll find in each profile can help you find a professional who is a good match for you  It's a lot more useful than just randomly calling a name from a list  you know what I mean    4  Read through a few profiles and see whom you'd like to work with    5  Go ahead and contact a few therapists through email or by phone  I suggest contacting a few  just in case there is a waiting list  If you need help with what to say  then let me know and I can write up a quick example that you can tweak or use as is        If you have no bad insurance and or are in a tough financial spot      In the US  the key phrases you want to look for are   sliding scale   or   income based    which just mean that the professional will take your financial insurance situation into account and lower the price  People can even qualify for free help  depending on their situation  As far as finding professionals who charge on a sliding scale or provide income based services  remember when I said above to look on the left sidebar after you search by your zip code or city to filter by your insurance provider  Well  you can disregard that part  Instead  what will happen anyway is that after you hit enter when you put in your zip code or city  a list of professionals will come up anyway    Click on any profile and scroll down to the finances section  If it says sliding scale  yes  then you're in luck because the price can be negotiated and should be able to be lowered    Now you know where to look for professionals who charge on a sliding scale  If you have any questions about anything  don't hesitate to ask me  I wrote a lot and some may be unclear  Feel free to ask anything   In my experience  weed is very counter productive  It can reduce the anxiety in the moment  but leads to overthinking things and paranoid thoughts  And it also warps your sense of reality a bit  making things worse  That slightly different perspective is cool in the moment  but if you smoke too much  it can be harmful   I know a lot of people here are giving you a pass on this  but I've been through a similar path you have and in my experience  it's better to deal with things head on  and LEARN to deal with them head on  That will make you stronger in the long run  and allow you to deal with anxiety when it comes back  which it often does   That's also why I'm not a fan of medication for anxiety  Certainly not long term  You're simply silencing the symptoms without dealing with the underlying issue that's causing them in the first place  propranolol is great  as mentioned above  it prevents physical symptoms but that helps your thinking too  it's far easier for panicky thoughts to overwhelm you if your body is panicking too  it gets me through anxious situations pretty well    I would really like to make some friends at work and go on at least one date before the end of the year  Very interesting So you're not actually seeing blood coming out of doors   Intrusive thoughts were the worst part about my rough patch of anxiety last year  They really can be terrifying and take many forms  What I learned is that the more you force those thoughts away out of fear  the more you are validating them in your mind  And they just keep coming back stronger and more frequent  I read tons on the subject  and what eventually worked for me was learning to see those thoughts coming and simply acknowledge them as 'oh  intrusive thoughts'  but not judging them as good or bad  Takes practise  But learning that will make you stronger in the long run   Journaling is a very good way to get to the underlying issues  but also just to realize how absurd those thoughts really are  and that there's no evidence that you would ever actually do them  They are thoughts  not impulses  You are not feeling a compulsion to do them  In fact  you are probably horrified by them  That's a good thing  Once you write things down in an anxious moment  and read them again when you are feeling good  you realize how silly they are  And that eventually takes away their power over you   A few articles I saved that helped me back then  that might perhaps help you    http   theworrygames com 2016 02 anxiety scary intrusive thoughts story   http   www megsanity com article asp title Lies Your Brain Tells You Why We Have Scary Thoughts post 49 My first panic attack came on after a discussion about death with my step father  The fear hits me at night too  for which I take xanax  Obviously that isn't a long term solution so I only take it when it is absolutely necessary  My sister recommended this Alan Watts' video  which did help me some  You might give it a watch      https   www youtube com watch v M7KRgluYeps  I know that probably isn't the answer you're looking for  but I haven't found the answer yet either  Death is a very difficult and anxiety provoking topic for me to discuss and ponder   I've locked myself in our bathroom and I'm to the point where I'll do whatever I can to get better  I can't live like this anymore  I can't let it ruin my life  I refuse to let it fuck this up anymore than it already has  Thank you for helping me  With the holiday I'm going to try to make some calls tomorrow  depending if they're open or not  I'm really going to force myself to do this  I have no other option  I need help   Stands for exposure response therapy  it's a type of cognitive behavioral therapy that involves confronting an obsession  the thoughts  but refraining from compulsions  the rituals   It's very effective in treating OCD   Look   the stinking dead moose in the room is your high pressure status   School in another COUNTRY   I bet you and your folks have stratospheric performance expectations  right      Plus you living this jetset life  living abroad is stressful EVEN IF YOU ARE HAVING A GOOD TIME    So give yourself a hug and pat on the back   You are at a high pressure time of life  and actually handling it well    Right now   With antibiotics  you have to suck it up until they are finished  but make sure to cover the basics 'in extremis'   no caffeine  no alcohol  plenty of low intensity exercise   time by yourself  no screens   to decompress   listen to ASMR for soothing  breathing exercises or simple meditation  and recover from the toxic impact of antibiotics namely full spectrum vitamins and minerals   and a range of gut repair supplements or foods  especially pre and probiotics      Try magnesium for immediate relief of anxiety  it's worth a try    And know this   you WILL make it through   Good luck for 2017  No  not real blood  Just sort of a mental picture of it happening  That's good it's effective but it sounds torturous  I'd be so scared to do it  Ah so then it sounds like OCD  Yes  you don't have to nor need to forgive  It's entirely up to you and to how you really feel  What matters the most is not being eaten up by bitterness or letting your anger hurt you  Sometimes we can forgive and sometimes some actions are just plain unforgivable   As for your friend  sometimes people project onto others their experience and it's also sometimes a way for them to reassure themselves that what they did was the right thing  ie not to question the pain that light still linger inside   But as other posters mentioned  it's your experience and yours only and everyone should respect that  Take care  You're welcome  It is possible to improve  Severe depression and severe anxiety ruined my life for many years  I've turned my life around with professional help  and I personally know many others from different group therapy settings who have turned their lives around too  It can be done  Of course  I'm not downplaying your struggles at all though  I just want to highlight the fact that people can and do improve  I hope things work out for you  If anything comes up  feel free to message me  I'm sorry you've been struggling  and I hope things work out for you  Wow thank you so much  I really appreciate the advice and those articles  It's so true that they're just thoughts  They scare me but they have no real power over me  I've really really needed to hear that  Thank you so so much   You are lonely  isolated and depressed   Therapy will help enormously  but you should look to FRIENDS not a SO as your primary buffer against loneliness      Also  depression results often from unresolved anxiety or stress  so therapy should start to address that too    Plus guess what  Everyone is lonely sometimes  and everyone cries  You are normal  then  Oooh okay  Then that would be called an intrusive thought which is OCD  Those are not hallucinations  Hallucinations are when you think that's it's really happening because you SEE blood coming from the door  Another thing is most people who hallucinate do not realize they are hallucinating  They won't say "I'm hallucinating blood coming from doors" instead they will say "there is fucking blood coming out of that door  "  You're welcome  Good luck and be proud of yourself for making the decision to get better  This is a huge victory  I forced myself to go on the adventure of a life time in May  5 weeks volunteering in Sri Lanka and I only had three panic attack the entire time  I was so immensely proud of myself for going despite everything in my head screaming at me to stay   Thank you very much Ya it is  but it's completely worth it  Anxiety will be through the roof when trying to not do the compulsion but it will come down and you slowly train your brain to break away from the patterns of OCD Glad you like it  From the many years of battling anxiety and depression I've hated how society is on this fast train kind of lifestyle  And they expect you to be on the same train  Making you less in control of your life and more in their control  It never started dawning on me until I started asking myself the right questions  Maybe it's age but after it become so exhausting to keep up with societies demands I decided to just not care anymore  Stopped caring who I would effect either  This is my life and I'll walk it how I want to  And I stand tall while doing it  Not just for myself but also in a twisted way to mock everyone in this world that  Jobs and school aren't everything  and don't expose you to all the parts of the world  You may not have found your 'thing' yet  Try volunteer work   you may find you love helping people  and it could lead into a paid job   and has already been suggested  therapy  Good luck  Yeah  my Doctor called them hallucinations  but I'm guessing that was a mis labelling  I guess I can definitely relate to that kind of apathy towards the way we are treated  I've never been spiteful   I guess it's partly who I am and partly desenstization as was said  And it's kind of scary sometimes so beware because it an lead to not recognizing what's out of line  I'm currently struggling with putting "healthy boundaries"   sometimes it's insedious   Sometimes I sometimes joke that it kind of feels like having been lobotomized  But then fortunately I can tell myself  "wait a minute  do not forget what happened and draw a line"  Do you have a history of anxiety  Are you on any medications for anxiety panic attacks   If this is your GP then he probably doesn't know the correct terminology  Most medical doctors are not well versed in psychology  unfortunately  2017 New Year's resolutions  1  Work on getting my self confidence back  2  Stop comparing myself to others so much  3  Stop seeking validation from other people   4  Be more comfortable doing things by myself  5  Keep progressing and getting better at supervising at work   6  Don't put so much pressure on myself to find a girlfriend   7  Be open to and have new experiences   8  Don't worry or dwell on the past anymore  That's good  I'm planning on telling my loved ones to tell me I'm asking for reassurance when I am  Is this a kind of ERP  since I'm not getting the reassurance I want  I've just relapsed after 2 years without medication  and for a couple of months I was worse than I've ever been  I've vowed to try anything and everything  and do better than I did last time  Write down how I'm feeling  talk about the things that are actually bothering me in therapy instead of avoiding them  being honest with myself and others about WHY I feel the way I do  I actually regulate my breathing and engage in mindfulness colouring  Anything that last time I would have dismissed as hippie bull     I'm actually giving a go  I can't go back on meds so it's all I've got  I'm doing ok  and I know you can too   You can look at a relapse as a failure  and as a step back  or you can look at it as a chance to get EVEN better upon another recovery  I'm trying to think the latter  thats's all I've got right now  Glad I could help  I noticed reading about other people's experiences  that had made it to the other side  really helped me  It's just so tough while you're in it if you have no idea what to do about it  and feel like you're alone in it  You're not  Lots of people experience the same thing or have at some point in their lives  Most found a way out  and so will you     And you'll probably end up stronger than before as a result of facing that  What  Fuck that shit it's 2017  B  Seriously though that ridiculous  don't let it bring you down I sometimes have this happen  Almost like I'm really really cold and just shivering  Only problem is it happens regardless of temperature   I have a similar obsessions compulsion where I write every word I hear in cursive in my head and also trace it with my finger  like I'm writing it in the air  It sometimes gets shut off  I have no control over when it gets turned on  off   What happens if you resist the urge to write    I did ecstacy at a big festival last night  By the time it had worn off I realized I was still dancing my ass off and being very social  It helped show me my true self and I plan on trying to bring it out this year  If that's what you want hope for then by all means make a family  It's like a little society in itself  However not everyone wants can make one  especially due to SA   I agree with the NC  I've learnt the hard way and was in your situation not so long ago and actually it's a never ending circle except if you exfiltrate yourself from it  They ineed act civil at first but then it's to prepare for an even more violent shitstorm  And even when one doesn't feel the need to mend anything and that it's just out of compassion  from my experience it's useless and even quite dangerous for you  too much trauma and fragilty can emerge afterwards   Happy new year  We can all pull through this together  no matter how bad the anxiety is  theyre the ones with the problem  do they think youre psychic  Are you seeing a therapist  You might need exposure therapy to work through this fear     Go to the festival that I've already bought the tickets for  don't be a complete hermit and maybe even get a job  After forty five years of self loathing and perennial self harm thoughts  I finally found the help I needed   Yes  it does get better  It does take way too fucking long  imo   but the man I am today would be nearly unidentifiable to my children  both physically  I've lost nearly 100lbs from my peak and 50 since I last saw my girls  as well as being completely me  nearly symptom free  and recently described as the embodiment of don Miguel Ruiz call that we all love until we can help everyone   It gets massively better    Find your solution  The Four Agreements was life altering for me   once on the twisted road home  you will find more peace than you thought possible  even if you've never known it before  It sounds as if these irrational thoughts are brought on by larger markets or places where crowds of people are to be expected  It's probably uncommon for you to visit such places  making it overwhelming  With time  it'll become easier  It doesn't sound as if your Anxiety is preventing you from leaving the house or anything so just keep trying    Best of luck   Therapy has helped me immensely   It took a few tries to find the right person  but when I did  it was like I could finally start feeling myself make progress   My therapist knows me well enough to know how far to push me  when to stop the session and calm things down  and how to make sure I leave her with a smile   So I personally would say it's worthwhile   Having someone who I can just talk to helps a lot  Even though it's too late now   for the future I really suggest you take it slow and not overload yourself no matter the "reward" for doing so  I had A LOT of friends who took a ton of honors AP classes and though some did benefit from scholarships or college admissions  way more of them failed  were burnt out  and regretted it  I made a similar mistake I've always been a workaholic so I took two jobs this summer to work 65 hours a week and make     and a month in my anxiety hit me like a brick wall and now I don't even have a job  This is an extreme example but you get my point   As for right now I would seek some help  be it a guidance counselor or a therapist outside of school  I recommend anyone doing this  even more so people with anxiety issues  I would have been so much better if I did that while I was in HS  Good luck   Yeah  I realize now that in the long run it probably won't work out  Thanks for the help  I HIGHLY suggest checking out the book "The Imp of The Mind" by Lee Baer  He talks all about intrusive thoughts and gives some advice about them  I have OCD which makes the intrusive thoughts even more problematic and I was hospitalized for exactly the thoughts you had  I was scared I'd give into them even though they were totally against my character  Therapy and medication has helped a lot with this and you learn how to deal with them    Good luck  I can't resist it  it will keep coming back  I try to resist it and go to sleep one day  next morning I try to remember it  it's tiring  I can't even sleep sometimes because it need to be written  Well hey don't loose all motivation either  just take a step back and judge yourself fairly and DO NOT beat up on yourself whatever the outcome   Another member of the club here    Just trying to hang on This is actually common with your eyes closed when experiencing mono  I don't experience it much anymore but it all started when I started having extreme symptoms of mono when I was in 5th grade  Hospitalized for three days because of it   Not currently  I was considering doing CBT but I'm not sure how well I could handle it  What clandestine said  I'd also recommend getting out and doing something physical if you think you can manage that  I have had mainly "Pure O" OCD my entire life  It makes living painful  and unrelated struggles become fifteen times harder  I can't shut my mind off  I'm always seeking reassurance  always assuming the absolute worst  It gives me a short temper because the anxiety rises up like a volcano under stress   I can't have discussions with my friends and disagree with them on something because I feel like I'm inherently wrong  that I'm flawed  that the things I think and feel are not as valid as anyone else's  It's why I'm constantly seeking reassurance  If I don't feel like I'm "perfect" to someone  it gives me a lot of anxiety  I can't have different views than my friends because I feel like my friends are "tainted" if they feel differently about something I take personally  it messes with that feeling of having "perfection"   I can't take anything at face value  I have to scrutinize and analyze and turn it over and over in my head until my brain is numb  I don't know how other people are so laid back and can let things go  It's foreign to me  everything in my brain has to be in order  have a place  be controlled and perfect    I get intrusive thoughts too  I have a hard time with sexual things because I always suddenly picture something awful  But those things bother me less than the constant analyzing  I'm so exhausted that I went to a sleep disorder center and they thought I had narcolepsy  I don't  we found out  because my brain is so burned out    I can't think of what else to say right now  I've been to therapy and have practiced mindfulness techniques  I've been on every kind of OCD medication  I just want peace  I'm too tired to try and keep going   Yeah  Even I wish  there was someone or some sort of guidance to deal with anxiety at a young age  But I'm glad I understand it better now  I did the same  and while it would have been nice to have been invited to more places  I got like 1 half assed invitation   I wasn't upset about not doing anything NYE  It's more about having to tell people you did nothing  I don't want them to pity me  so I feel like I've gotta make something up  like when my parents ask what I did   That's exactly why I'm so scared of relationships    Yes  not giving into the compulsion  reassurance seeking  for example  is part of the ERP  but one thing that ERP involves is specific triggering of things  carefully chosen  so that you don't start with stuff too far advanced  it's entirely staggered so that you build up to the hard triggers  and then active resistance of the compulsions  So  it is a very active process  It is difficult  but achievable   like climbing a mountain  you go one step at a time  and you bring along the right supports  I think of it like going outside into the sun after having lived indoors for years   you'll get a bad sunburn fast  so you need to work up slowly to being able go to the beach  if you get my drift   I'm glad to hear that you're making your friends family part of the process by letting them know about reassurance seeking behaviour  Friends and family can be amazing allies in overcoming OCD  Good luck  Very true  I think it was the combination of a new place  lots of people crowded into one room  and the fact I was the only new person  Whatever  ill get over it  Thanks  Yeah  but i think that since I was new and don't stand out  they all probably thought I was understanding of their traditions Gone  A shame I only had one to give  Either way  I strongly suggest journaling to everyone  If you aren't already  google the benefits of journaling and gratitude journaling too  I used to get it on my right calf muscle  Everything's fine right now  I stopped worrying about the thought that something was wrong  the twitches disappeared  Hope it gets better for you   1  Making an appointment to see a therapist   2  Getting a job  Possibly starting with volunteer work  I want to do something where I can help people  like volunteering at a crisis hotline  3  Going to the gym more often  I'm buying a calendar from Target to track the days that I go to the gym  Maybe I'll put little stickers on the days that I go or do something nice for myself if I reach a certain number of days  The calendar app on my phone is nice  but I thought this would be more fun and stickers are cute    I've been weaning myself off of caffeine for the last week  I usually have 3 cup of coffee at home and a LG Iced coffee on the way to work  Now  one regular cup at home  and a LG Decaf Iced Coffee on the way to work Fuck it  Just do it  Are you me from a different timeline or something   A very similar thing happened to me yesterday   Me and some other guy I'm somewhat familiar with came quite a bit early to my friend's place to help with the food and just to have some fun before the party  Well  at least the evening wasn't all bad when it was just the three of us  I've actually had some decent time   Then the guests came  They were mostly people from my friend's uni so I hardly knew any of them   I clearly wasn't on the same page with anything that was going on  At first I just stood there brooding and having an occasional drink to numb the shitty feeling growing up inside  Eventually I started walking around the place and came across an empty bedroom  I sat there on the floor and then had the worst panic attack in my life   I was fucking petrified  shaking  my entire body felt numb and tingling like when your hand falls asleep  I couldn't stop crying and I could hardly breathe  This shit went on for more than an hour    At least no one saw what a train wreck of a human being I am   When finally I was semi functioning I said my goodbyes and crawled back home   I'm still feeling utterly miserable  Will it ever fucking end   Podcast's  or the like  I find those calm my nerves of the most  I don't have an answer  but your feelings are very normal    College is a waste as far as preparing people for the real world    You might be doing better than you think      I remember one thing when I had to manage other people   Your best people always believe they are failing  and your failing people always think they are doing great   My guess is you are really doing great and don't realize it     If you are like me  you can manage anxiety as long as you can work 40 hours a week  get sleep  eat  and exercise   If I work 50 hours I lose it   If your job always requires more than 40 hours  you may need to find another job   If you can work with your boss to get hours down to 40  I would consider staying    u have to question ur SA thoughts and ask why u expect certain things in certain situations  Like hearing peeps laugh n thinking they must be laughing at YOU specificly   One day i realized how ridiculous it was and how its all just self projection   I was in a climbing hall with some pals socializing I couldnt reach the top of a climbing tower so i jumped down to try again and just as soon as my feet touched the ground  i heared giggling from some chicks behind me a little further away and instantly thought they were laughing at me   In that moment i felt totally embarrased for basically nothing but unlike usual i didnt just accept the negativ SA thought but instead questioned it like   "why would they be laughing at me "  " how should i even know they are laughing about me "  then i looked around in the hall  everyone was in their own world concetrating on the their tower  which one to climb next  or just having fun joking  talking with others  And I realized nobody really cares if u fail or look retarded everyone is inside their world minding their business    And even if u fail and someone laughs  like u slip and almost fall in the middle of the bus and everyone sees and some ppl giggle laugh happend to me 2x in a week  you have to remind yourself how irrelevant that 10 max 30 sec scene was in your 100000  hours film called life  I've joked that I just need to buy a huge rv to be able to leave my little safety bubble  as my biggest agoraphobia triggers are lack of privacy in which to calm down and being away from my bathroom  Both of these could be eased a good bit by being able to head to the back of the rv to lay down  use the bathroom  turn on Netflix  put a cold washcloth on my neck  etc    But then I think about trying to maneuver a huge rv among traffic  in and out of parking  around corners  and I freak out even harder  So I'd need to be rich and hire a driver      No life being lived is wasted  ever  You'll get through this and who knows you could meet someone who has their own issues  most people do to some extent  you could be their rock despite your own illness   Have you considered therapy   I think that will be the only thing to be rid of the symptoms  stop interacting with people I only count failure as having not got past my front door  you fell at the last hurdle BUT you just vaulted 20 of them like a champ PLUS you used your feelings of failure  not actual failure  just feeling like you failed  disappointment  to get out again AND work on a plan that would lead you to hopefully be able to achieve what you wanted to do next time  Nowhere near a failure  Always nice to see people here face the fear of SA  This is my goal  Look at people and think about every single one of them with love   Even when I feel humiliated  angry  tired  hungry  frightened or ignored   Remember that they have no responsability for or power over my emotions  I just know that working on changing my attitude   every single day   will make it easier for me  And easier for other people to like me     Mine is more dedicated to my depression  To finally lose weight and become thin  I've been fat all my life  I've always dreamed of changing my profile picture to a thin me  No history and no medication  You have people  Id love to have people t share these feeling of anxiety with  Gotten sick 2nights in and told to leave work on the 2nd one and am fearing for my job when hopefully theres no reason to  A third of my friends are college graduates  a third college drop outs and a third married with kids  They all stress me out in diff ways but the ones who partied all the time gave me the most anxiety out of any friendships I've had  Mind you I hate substances  Had a great run with them and then just lost the desire to do them anymore  I'm the odd girl out having 1 glass of wine at dinner and feeling guilty about it  But I realized for me personally something changed in me  My goals  my morals  Somehow through my anxiety I persevered and made it to adult hood with my head on straight  Unfortunately straight on doesn't always mean ok  I don't go to house parties  I don't drink at the club  Music festivals used to be my life and now I'd rather save the money for other things  It took me a while to accept that I'm changing into an adult I never saw myself wanting to be  Hum drum boring and lame  But it helps my anxiety to just be me  Unapologetically just lame old me   Wow yes  very recognizable   But I can't say more without some more context  why you broke up  etc   Don't feel too bad  My brother's friend came round to our house once and sat on the cat  Poor guy was very embarrassed  cat was fine    I recommend reading The Happiness Trap  This book has been helpful for me  still trying to determine my purpose though  Thanks fkr the reply  I listen to quite a few podcasts but I'm always afraid to listen at night because if I fall asleep I'll lose my place    Got any favorites  particularly ones that it doesn't really matter if you doze off   This has nothing to do with traditions   If there was a chair that wasn't free for anyone to sit in  it should have been mentioned to you   That's all on them  As I walk down the street  I imagine all the terrible things that could happen to people happening  It's very vivid for me too  Any excursion outside plays through my head like a disaster movie  I also compulsively read news  and sometimes fixate on events that resonate with me in some way   The intrusive thoughts don't bother me anymore  The way I deal with them is maybe silly  but it works for me  I let them play through my head like a movie  but sort of back off in my head so it's all actually on a screen  Then I turn the screen off or just walk away  Sometimes it comes back  but I just turn it off again and try to distract myself   The compulsive news checking is harder  My anxiety that leads to it stems from other things besides intrusive thoughts  I also have Tourette's   and I haven't figured out how to stop the checking  But if you ever just want to talk to someone with similar problems  feel free to message me  I find writing to be helpful  journaling can be very underrated  Make sure to date them so can track your progress  for me personally  when i pick i dont feel any pain  no matter how deep i go because i get into a 'mode' and become fairly numb    But yes afterwards the spots do hurt and are sore if i touch them If it's something that's recurring and causing quality of life issues I'd recommend seeing your doctor and possibly getting a referral to a psychiatrist  On your own  you can look into the book Feeling Good by Dr  David Burns  It has some information on anxiety and mood disorders  as well as exercises and techniques  cognitive behavioral therapy  to deal with them  Other than that  speaking with a therapist is usually quite helpful  Even talking with a friend or journaling your anxieties and emotions helps ground your thoughts  making it easier to deal with the anxiety  Rooster teeth podcast as its mostly just them talking about random stuff or there life  or the stuff you should know podcast is also pretty nice  Also one that i forgot to add is audio books  they give my mind something to think about other then being anxious   If Prozac doesn't seem to be helping then  I highly recommend you talk to your doc  If it was a random incident then  that's perfectly normal  Medications like Prozac isn't a fix but  rather a band aid  Therapy would help aid in recovery  For many meds like Prozac won't stop panic attacks altogether but  will help minimize the amount of times they happen and the intensity of them   Check your PM  In order to start "owning" yourself and your mental health again  it is super important to get back on medication and finding therapy  I have gone through various forms of treatments  psychotherapy  general ralking  specialist rape counsellings   If i am honest  taking therapy is the best one to start with  expecially with a specialist service if you can find it  Its extremely therapeutic being able to express on the "secret" flashbacks  nightmares  trauma you have had  From there  when you are feeling a bit more comfortable with expressing things  Interventiom therapy is essential  Anxiety  management  CBT and perhaps addiction help  if relevant  can really beneficial   EMDR was the absolutely brilliant though  It got rid of a series of nightmares flasbacks  triggers in one session  So i highly rate that   Overall  yes things can get better  but you need to put the work in too  And you are putting that work in   Unfortunately the world wont reach out to help you  We are all too blinded by our own insecurities  But there is help out there  Just keep pushing for it  always   Sorry for the tangent  Best of luck too you xx    Also sorry for the spelling grammer mistakes  I hate my phone and fat fingers   Ugh  I'm so sorry you had to go through that  it's just the worst feeling in the world     What I came to realize after talking to some of my extroverted friends is that they're not even aware of how difficult and upsetting this can be for some of us  It's usually nothing personal  socializing comes so naturally to them that it doesn't occur to them someone is totally freaking out in the same situation   still feels really shitty  though    Thanks for replying  I hope your year turns out to be great despite its lousy start    You have people  No  I don't  I put a few typos in my essay that i sent to a few colleges and I still got in  They were well respected state schools  Unless it's seriously egregious  I wouldn't worry  I freaked about the same exact thing lmao   If you didnt get in it wasnt the essay  trust me on that  I would love to be comfortable on a dance floor  and particularly around women in that situation      Over the last year I've been really getting into techno and house music  which I find to be pure bliss in its own right  And I'm learning and collecting the necessary equipment to make it myself  and that's something I feel very confident about and would never think twice about if I was "good enough " if that makes sense  I mean I haven't even produced a whole song yet  but I don't have any serious doubts about my capacity for it and I'm super happy to know that 2017 will be the year I start releasing music for public consumption    But then on the flip side  I'm having a really tough time getting out of the anxiety loops I put myself into whenever I go to music events  For all of my musical ability  I have a disappointingly poor 0  natural talent with dancing  I've actively avoided dancing my entire life  but now all of a sudden  my love for EDM means it comes along with this horrible obligation  And it's like I hate myself when I see all these beautiful girls waiting for someone to dance with and I pretend not to notice and just withdraw from the situation  but I also fucking hate myself when I start dancing around people and they either actually laugh at me or I imagine that that must be what's happening  and I know that both regularly happen which makes it tricky   And it's weird because on one hand I have 0 interest in dancing so in theory it shouldn't matter to me that I can't do it  but on the other  I don't want to deprive myself of the amazing music and the opportunity to meet incredibly enticing women just because of my social anxiety   Tl Dr  I'm a remarkably bad dancer despite my musical interests normally associated with dancing  I want to learn how to dance and how to be comfortable while doing it  so that I'm not missing out on the great opportunities in my life Maybe that's the factor that will break the log jam for me being excessively self conscious  Thanks for sharing your experience How do you define "seriously egregious"  It's not like I just misspelled a word or something  I would say change in subject matter from what you were trying to say or just a metric shitton of typos all over the essay   If that's that case I would say to try and email call the admissions office and ask if you can change the essay  That's the plan for sure   deleted                     0 9904      What is this   https   pastebin com 64GuVi2F 70458  I take it that you've been reading online about side effects  Wellbutrin is fairly safe in general  No one here can accurately tell you how you will respond to it unless you try it out  Honestly the fear anxiety from "side effects" is worse than  any actual side effects you might experience in real life good chance you won't experience side effects at all not everyone does  just take it with good faith and see how it works out for you  If for whatever reason you have concerns while taking the medication  call your doc and explain what is going on   Again  define metric shitton  I have 4 in a 30 word essay  No idea how the hell they all slipped through  Very appropriate username     I am the same way    Huh  That happens to me sometimes  It feels like i have boobs  like a pressure on my chest and then i touch my chest to make sure I don't want boobs  Thankfully it's not as serious as my HOCD  Keep pushing yourself bro  best of luck    Like literally 2 3 typos in every sentence   Mind if you try and describe some of the typos  I've been going through your post history and i made the same sort of errors in my essay that I sent to a few schools  missing words  replacing words with totally different ones  etc  As long as you think it gets the message across  you're fine  Calm down  and if you're really that worried call or email your universities tomorrow and see if they will accept another one  As others have said  if you didn't get in  it definitely wasn't becasue of some typos  They  won't throw away a student's body of work due to a few typos  Yes  and my dad is a doctor so I'm fairly well versed in things like that  I took the first 100mg today  nothing to report except for I feel like I'm on speed  Thank you very much for your response  I understand what you mean by managing working hours   Honestly  I would not even mind working the long hours if I at least knew what I was doing half the time during those hours  The biggest part of my supposed anxiety and dredd comes from the inherent contradiction that I am floundering and scraping by without really knowing what I am doing truly  I know that's what learning on the job is for  but I feel there is never enough time for that to happen properly for my learning pace   Therefore I fear my work  fear I am doing something wrong  and keep putting it off because I don't think I even have the capabilities to do it appropriately    But I guess if everyone had the capabilities right away  the job wouldn't be a professional career job   I think I may just not be interested or passionate in the subject material I am dealing with to motivate me to do self learning on my own time   Well first things first  you and I certainly won't be here to experience this  neither will your children or your grandchildren or even their children  Second of all  think how far science has progressed over the last few years  It's insane  Sure there are still terrible diseases in the world that we haven't found the cure to  but think how far science could come by the time you and I are in our 60s or 70s  I'm assuming you're not that old  Haha  Perhaps we may find a way to "save the world" or even find a new planet with similar conditions as Earth and we move there  I think Prof  Stephen Hawking said something like "For humanity to carry on  we would need to find a new planet" and humans are great when faced with adversity  If we all came together  all the smartest minds come together to figure out how to save the human race  bare in mind this will be years and years away   and I wouldn't be surprised if ideas are already been thrown around haha  But perhaps there is technology that hasn't been invented yet that could help  I mean if you were to say to someone in the 80s that everyone will walk around with small telephones that can connect you with everyone in the world  I mean that's crazy  But here we are  here I am talking to you   So try not to worry  no offence but it's out of your hands and out of my hands  Focus on yourself and what you can control  It's really hard to explain people who don't understand the feeling  Makes it feel even worse   Yeah  I wrote the sentance "The challenges can about virtually subject" when I was trying to say "The challenges ca   be   about virtually   any   subject "  The most minor one here  I said "other players works" instead of work  just a small issue not too worried about that one   And then I said "I love the intellectual native of these round" as opposed to   nature     I appreciate your support  Really  Oh yeah Wellbutrin does have a super a stimulating feeling for many  I also felt the same when I first took it  I didn't take it for depression anxiety but for ADD  There's other options better suited for depression than just taking Wellbutrin alone  Wellbutrin is often used in conjunction with other anti depressants  Wellbutrin is often prescribed to help combat the lethargic feeling from AD's    helps with loss of libido also caused by AD's   My goals are to wake up early  be grateful for everyday  acknowledge negative thoughts and know that they wont get me  and change the way I look at interacting with people and work on enjoying it   Depression   Seriously  I never felt truly happy ever till I got on medication  I'm less affected by it when I'm drunk  But  when the alcohol wears off  there is hell to pay   it just seems so dumb  like nothing really means anything to anyone anymore  i'll be moving out in a year so i'll be sure to do that asap  for now though i live in a small town with not much to do and not many people to meet  I went through something that's somewhat similar  What I ended up finding out is that she was so stressed at her new job and she was stressed at home  So she would shut down sexually and emotionally  So I took it upon myself to make sure she's at the very least not as stressed when she's home  I cleaned daily  cooked  made sure we had everything stocked like food cleaning stuff and I got her to join me on some light exercise like walks and body weight exercises  I also tried to get her to talk about what stressed her out about the work day  I basically made sure she can come home and just relax as much as possible and do little as possible  I also took a step back with the sexual stuff    After a while she was feeling much better  Her intimacy also came back and it was better than ever  Plus I got her into exercising so she's also healthier now   i'm just starting to grow up  still have more than a year till i move out though  side note  are you a writer  you seem like you'd be a good writer  And this might cheer you up  I love this song    https   youtu be buqtdpuZxvk In a nutshell when you let anxiety consume you  you're basically fighting yourself  Sad to say there is no easy fix  One useful thing that I do is to practice mindfulness  If you take a step back and think about it  Panic can make you believe the world is gonna come crumbling down but  count how many times all your worries and fears actually came true  If you're like me   i can't count any because none of what's going on in my head has actually happened  You got this and you can pass your drivers test  Most of my neighbors don't know me  and I think the ones who do are busy watching television etc       There were some dogs which barked  but they seem to be indoors for the colder weather     I suppose if you have transportation  you might be able to go to a park  and walk something more scenic  with strangers    Are meds really that worth it  I'm depressed too   Thank you so much    How do you stop yourself repanicking after mindfullness  Or do the effects last a long time for you  I've been trying to cut off caffeine but I'm really addicted to soda since my junior year of high school  Send help  Sophmore in college  So glad you posted this because I feel like I need help   I spent New Years alone  I was in the house with my grandparents  but still  I didnt have an SO  And being on Facebook  Instagram seeing everyone with their SOs having a great night and 3 of my best friends all in relationships and me single  its tough  I always find this time of the year hard when I see everyone with someone and me alone   Im soon to be 29 too and the thought of being single when Im 30 is not nice  I just want to be with someone and be happy  I do have options but  Im not attracted to the options I do have otherwise Id just settle and be with them   Can anyone help  Thanks  Oh  good  glad you were able to talk with a college counselor  You are probably not the first student she's had with anxiety depression  I agree that taking fewer classes is wise  you don't want to overload yourself with credits  especially your first semester back  That's exciting   So happy for you    I hope you continue to improve  Right  This isn't a new topic for me lol   I do know that I enjoy stimulants  rave music  and feeling comfortable around other people  so it's kinda crazy I haven't tried it yet Me too  Spent NYE sober for this reason  This is something that you need to deal with first before you get back with her or jump straight back into a relationship  Otherwise youre just going to keep self sabotaging your own happiness and why  For what   I felt like this and I wish I could say this is how I made it stop but I guess its different for everyone  For me  she was my world  my number one priority  but to her  I was just some guy she was dating  So I invested more than she did  Eventually I started caring less and less  focusing on myself  Seeing my friends and keeping busy  Thats the key I think  keeping yourself busy and seeing friends   family  When youre alone doing nothing  thats when your mind wanders and its never a good thing  at least in my experience   So go to the gym  be the best version of yourself possible  Learn a new language  read a book  take up a sport  find a new hobby  Something anything   But also  seek help  I started talking to a therapist and some of the stuff he suggested to me really has helped  I also saw my doctor who gave me some anti depressants to help    The help is out there  you just need to take advantage of it and dont let your negative thoughts about your past relationship or who you are as a person define you  Its all a lie  youre an amazing  beautiful person who does deserve her and someone even better   150  yes  Once you find the right one you will feel 10 000  better  I feel so much more clear  mood swings don't happen often  I'm not over sleeping  I don't sit on the couch or lay in bed all day most days  I don't lose interest in things all the time  I can feel my happiness  I can simply feel myself be happy without the foggy ness making me feel less  The day I realized my medication kicked in I cried because my emotions weren't dulled down being forced into the gray area I felt pure happiness for the first time probably in my life and I was just so happy  Your thoughts and emotions are stronger than anything else  It seems hard which trust me    I know that it is  but the moment you don't let panic set in and practice mindfulness   it's long term effects can last forever  Seems crazy to think that you control panic right  I thought so at first  Something my therapist told me and I believe in it now   the more energy you put into something panic  the stronger it'll become  The thing that keeps a panic attack going is sometimes also due to your breathing  the whole cliche of deep breaths and control your breathing does in fact have meaning   I'm 35 and for what it's worth i'm in the aame boat   Every time there's a holiday i'm reminded of all the fun others get to have with one another and how alone and hopeless i always felt since i was a boy   If it's any comfort you have a 12 year head start on me and i didnt have all the online communities to reach out to for support back then   Meetup is great  Tinder only makes me feel depressed and more worthless   When going to a meetup ask yourself why it is tou're really going   Is it out of desperation or are you pursuing something that will help you grow   ie  learning a new skill or playing a game that will be engaging  etc  Don't let it get you too down  I know it's not easy  I was made fun of by my whole family growing up  I learned not to trust people  if my family is like this what are normal people like  I isolated myself and got deeper into my SA    I talk to my family a few times a year  you're not alone     I've tried Effexor XR and unfortunately it caused a lot of stomach upset  But thanks for sharing  Life tends to be living life on edge  I suffer from Generalised Anxiety Disorder  so life tends to feel exhausting    You know that feeling when you miss a step or you lean too far back in your chair  Imagine that  having that little mini heart attack out of the blue every day  The constant worrying and "What if " You physically feel tense because of this constant worrying  you feel tired and fatigued    Other than the grey skies and rain  anxiety brings  there are few moments of peace and you truly appreciate those moments in life  Moments you can relax  even if those moments are very short and not as frequent as you like   So  over a long term  anxiety does feel as if a little gremlin is sat on your shoulder waiting to strike  But you become familiar to the cycles of anxiety and depression  slowly get better at controlling it  There are days where anxiety does overwhelm you with a combination with depression  Overall  life feels as if you're falling  but it just takes a few moments to realise you're firmly stood on the ground     We are all special  Nobody should allow an illness or a disease to define them as a person  Your personality  your character defines you as a person   Youre low at the moment which is understandable but you need to snap out of it  This way of thinking isnt helping  its feeding negative thoughts which can be dangerous   Im guessing your British since youre studying at a university  Im British too  if you ever want to chat  hit me up  But seek help  I saw my GP and they referred me to a therapist  CBT which is helping and also anti depressants  Im not sure if you can take them given your situation  But do you take any meds for your problems  If not  go see your doctor to sort you some out    Also  diet is key  if youre eating bad then that wont help your illness  the better you eat  the better youll feel  I know  its hard  believe me  but after the first couple days itll be easier to do   I think also  since its a new year you need a game plan  Focus on yourself and progress within yourself  what would you like to do  Would you like to get in a relationship  Then start thinking about ideas of how you want to do that  theres someone for everyone despite your situation   Do you want a new job or a new hobby  Have a think about what interests you    And dont be afraid to reach out to friends and family  they love you  they care about you and thats what theyre there for  Thats what friends are for  Dont worry  youll have their back one day      I want to try Lexapro again  but the last time I tried it  I never made it through the side effects  My stomach is very sensitive with the SSRIs  and I'm not sure how to combat that   EDIT  I've tried ADs  which i'm on now   I take remeron  but it doesn't seem to do anything for my anxiety  The only reason i'm on it still is because without it I wouldn't have an appetite   SSRIs  SNRIs  Anti psychotics and Mood Stabilizers  I'm going to give it a go and hopefully won't mess up on Tuesday  You've saved me  You're not a pedophile if you are repulsed by the thoughts  They are unwanted  They do not  turn you on    This is really common with OCD  just look online   Thank you so much for your thoughtful reply  It means a lot that people spend time helping those in need  even on Reddit   Your story makes a lot of sense  and actually sounds a bit like my own  I get what you're saying about fixing myself first  and I know that has to be a priority right now It's just so hard because I'm a fixer so I want things to just get better  I know you are right though  there needs to be a series of events  I need to learn from patterns of behavior in the past   You gave some really solid advice  and I will say that I'm talking to a therapist and I'm back on medication  Toward the end of each day I'm usually feeling way more confident about myself  but it's like the clock resets every night and I wake up in the morning with no motivation because it doesn't feel like I'm working towards anything significant  Have you experienced this too   Replace it with seltzer water with fruit  That's what I did  Soda is ridiculously bad for you and your anxiety  I noticed huge improvements when I cut it   I guess I need someone to reassure me  This is not what you need  You already know the truth  seeking reassurance just strengthens the cycle of worrying  As I would love to be off the benzos  I unfortunately can't get off them until my pdoc finds a medicine that will work for me    OCD 101   intrusive thought       anxiety         validates fear         repeat   The thoughts will not stop at the beginning  that's beyond your control  You need to train the metaphysical side of you to not give a fuck and not confirm your obsession  You're brain will feel tense and your muscles will spasm because it feels so odd not to respond  But you'll gradually build your tolerance and in a week  you'll be astonished by the evolution of your mind  It's not complicated  It's precisely how people normal people respond to intrusive thoughts  and how you respond to topics impartial to your OCD   For example  you see an extremely attractive guy at the market  You probably imagine him naked and going at it next to the frozen pizza  But that's absurd  it's obviously not going to happen hahaha  So you think of the most rational response to get his attention  if you're on the prowl   start a conversation  initiate eye contact  etc  But what if you were afraid that it was going to happen  Convinced that you guys will start fucking right then and there  and that people would see or you'd get arrested  Hopefully  from your perspective  that'd be a little extreme   But unfortunately  that's exactly what's happening in your circumstance  You're thinking about a man not in the room  whom you've ended intimacy with  and have had a enough time to process the depression  But yet you are convincing yourself that you can't let go  Of course  it feels like you need to  But it's merely an illusion of the intrusive thoughts you fuel with anxiety    you got this  Anxiety has a list of "symptoms" rapid heart rate  lump in throat feeling  numb tingling feeling in arm legs face and head  difficulty talking  slurring  dizziness  cold feeling   hot flashes and the list just goes on and on  Although ALS is a serious issue   if you're prone to anxiety  the likelihood of it being ALS is slim to non existent  If you truly believe you might have ALS  set up an appt to have a talk with your doc  IMO I wouldnt suggest going down that road because  again  if you're prone to anxiety testing for something like ALS is pricey with no insurance  If you have insurance then take full advantage of it  A simple yet effective test that I was given was to take a simple test dose of a benzodiazepine  If will almost instantly help stop any physical feelings as well as mental "symptoms" of anxiety  If it doesn't then it would be a good idea to make an appt with a doc   I'm starting CBT this month and I'm super excited to see how it helps  I've heard a ton of good things from people on here and friends who have done it  This year I'm going to be less passive about my anxieties and push more to take control rather than be controlled  Yeah  quite tempted to see a doc about it  But even now  that I've calmed down a bit and have looked at the ALS incidence rate I kind of realise now that it was likely anxiety as I don't have any of the symptoms at the moment  But thanks  Hi  Thank you for such a long and thoughtful reply     I am not taking any medications for my anxiety  I also have a phobia of medication  or more specifically  having an allergic reaction to medications   I tried Cipralex in the summer  but possibly  had a reaction  The doctors said it's impossible to know if it was a real reaction or just my anxiety  but to stop the meds just in case      I am on a medication for my acid reflux  which usually does help  I also have really bad IBS   it runs in my family  Ugh    Right now I just ate a few pieces of vegetarian sushi for dinner and I'm already freaking out  It's like as soon as it gets dark  I can't function anymore  It really helps knowing that other people have gone through something similar  and have improved   I also feel like nausea vomiting is worse than death  I also have contemplated death during especially bad bouts of nausea  I'm so frustrated right now  Sometimes yes  Not sure why either  I know your pain  My husband has been trying to find me one because I would never get around to doing it  I hate talking on the phone  surprise surprise   But I've had a hard time finding someone whose hours work for me and that I also feel comfortable with  On a positive note  I have had two counsellors in the past that I absolutely LOVED  One when I was younger and living with my parents  and another one my husband and I went to last year when we lived in a different city   Think about the freedom it'll give you  No more asking for rides  taking the bus  Just the whole independence a DL can give you  Well worth the panic it can cause  Even if you don't have a car  a DL is the stepping stone  That's another thing I personally do   weigh out the cons and pros of situations  Even if you fail   you tried and failed  Not trying is the worst thing because  you won't know what could've happened  Doesn't only apply for a DL but life in general  If you know how to drive and studied   a DL test will be a small but huge victory  Im a fixer too  I like to problem solve and like to be in control a lot of the times  I feel quite vulnerable when Im not  But the fact of the matter is  you and I cant solve all the problems  we can only solve our own that affect us  if its someone else who has the problem  then its up to them  we cant do anything  it sucks  but its life  And if we were all the same then itd be boring   What you can fix is the things that are bothering you  the problems that arise in your relationships  your anxiety  the feeling that youre not good enough for someone  Ive felt like that but the only way to get over it is by improving yourself  working on yourself OR just fake it until you make it  Every morning when you get up say a little mantra to yourself  a long the lines of Im a confident  funny  sexy guy  or something  Just fake it until you make it   For example  Ive felt like Im not good enough and I realise what I need to do to feel myself again and to love myself is get back in shape  Lose the weight so that I see myself as being attractive to others  that I love myself and then everything else will fall into place because it just radiates off you  So for me  if I get in shape Ill have a better chance of meeting a girl and being in a relationship with someone Im attracted to  Ill feel more confident meeting new people  for example  when I go for an interview  Im wanting to switch careers this year  and my overall health and mood will be good you know  All from losing weight and being healthy   Mornings are rough for me too  I wake up with no plans for the day   Im currently off work for holiday  I work in the restaurant industry  We take holidays when we can get them  So Im kicking it at home  with no real plans  no one to see  it sucks  But  I say ok  so I need to go to the gym  I need to be super healthy on my diet today  I need to look for a new job  I need to sort this out at my bank  I need to do this to my car  I need to sell this or I need to read this book  Or even  I want to talk to this friend today  see this family member today  Its all about having little productive things or stuff to look forward to   Youre not alone man  So dont worry ok  Were all in the same boat  at least Im in the boat with you where are we sailing to      Have you ever heard of relationship ocd   Reddit has a subreddit called ROCD     it kind of sounds like what you might be going through Lurker but made an account just to say I relate to this so much  You aren't alone and your obsessive thoughts are NOT you    I suffer from similar OCD almost exactly like you  that's the nature of this illness  When these thoughts come  as hard it is to get out of your head  try to tell yourself that "my OCD is making me feel or think   "  not "you"  It helps separate yourself from the OCD  Also try to focus on something else  I try to tell myself "id like to move on to something else now   "   Really tho I know I'm not what I think too and know I'm not some sick person  neither are you  The intrusive thoughts can be horrible sometimes  and certain people can really trigger it after those thoughts manifest    but remember that you aren't your thoughts and you know deep down you know yourself  I hope I explained this okay I am in the same boat as you with all this  so just giving you some advice I learned from friends and therapy  Stay strong and remember you don't need reassurance from anyone  I can completely relate to always wanting that tho haha story of my life  and separate yourself from the OCD the best you can   Mainly  I want to build my confidence  I've been feeling pretty motivated for the last week  I'm going out for some drinks with co workers wednesday night  and I'm gunna try to approach people at the bar  and just have conversations with them  Maybe i'll get lucky  and actually meet someone i click with  Take a few steps back   Ask yourself why you feel like you've failed at such a young age  Many people get kicked out of school but can still manage in life with the right attitude  Your mum sounds like she is just trying to help you out  so at least thank her for that but in this instance it sounds like it didn't work and that's just part of trying   nothing wrong with it at all  Figure out what it is in life that you enjoy doing and spending time on and shape it into a hobby and perhaps a job or career  For example if you like movies  look at working at a cinema  If you like sport  a sport store  My point is  once you fix your attitude to something and realise that you can indeed overcome your anxieties you'll be on your way to making good decisions and improvements   take it from someone who knows   All the best    This  It's not a real thing  Just an ad hominem used by confused feminists  If it'll give you peace of mind then see your doc about it   won't hurt to ask  The things that anxiety can manifest itself into is   to me   insane  I've been battling anxiety panic for years and even to this day I somehow exp new symptoms because  of it  But at the end of the day I am prone to anxiety and I always keep that in mind  Maybe write down what you're doing when it happens  maybe you can somehow figure out what exactly is triggering those sensations for you   Don't feel bad about ranting  its a tough disease and people for the most part don't understand how you feel   You most likely have nothing  but if it turns out you did you would have it cured before you notice any symptoms  There are pills that quickly kill ringworm    Also keep in mind that two members of your family currently have this  are they freaking out like you  Probably not because they know its curable   Accept the fact that the fear of this will be with you until you can talk to a doctor about it  Fear is your enemy not the facts  The facts before you are not particularly concerning but your illness is making it worse   Distraction will only give you temporary relief    accept the fact that you have fear and breathe your fear in  Remain calm through fear   Then breathe out the fear  Try this for a half hour at least  just accepting your fear and accepting that it won't go away for a little while  Its also not going to kill you   Remind yourself that it takes a tough person to overcome OCD and don't feel shame for it   Cheers buddy  If you're up for it  apologise to them but then also explain that you didn't know and that no one told you anything about it  You can't be expected to "just know" that's what is done  If you do that you acknowledge you did something that offended them  but you also stand up for yourself and that deserves respect  If they still don't like that  then they are the ones with the problem not you   1  I'm going to therapy this year  I was given medication a few weeks ago but I haven't taken it yet   2  I aim to make some actual friends at work  Or at least be able to speak to them without freaking out and over analysing everything they say   3  I'm determined to stop punishing myself and re living embarrassing moments over and over again  That doesn't sound like something a stupid guy would do  More like a very good guy     Sounds like you're fixated on the issue and so over thinking it   I think you know this  though  so you're headed the right direction    It depends on what you were doing and the guy  Some are oblivious  Way to be    I really want to do something similar but for 12 months in china  Vietnam or Cambodia  The anxiety thing is a challenge  but I'm hoping I can overcome it  I've definitely been in your shoes  and have now reached a point in my life where I have great friends whom I love  so there's hope  One thing to remember is that many people  even those who are very outgoing  go through periods where they feel alone and like meeting people is difficult  Try to remember that this is just your situation right now  and it doesn't define who you are or who you'll always be  I have OCD too   was in law school and I had a final exam  which I wasn't prepared for  took 20 pages of notes and once I got there I realized I was only allowed one page of notes  So I had to pick which one of the 20 pages was most important to me and throw away the rest   Got a B  still   Your anxiety is your only enemy  you will miss some questions but the only people who fail exams for the most part are the people who really don't care  You're clearly not one of those people   Just take one question at a time and you will be good I'm sure of it How are you on your own  Do you like spending time by yourself   I agree  La Croix is a good substitute  Still fizzy and has some flavor   I'd like to emphasize the importance of contacting your insurance to ensure that they will cover visits with whichever specific provider you choose  There is always a small possibility that online info is out of date or wrong and if you talk to an insurance rep  make sure to take down their name  and they tell you that they participate with the provider you choose  then you shouldn't be liable for more than just your copay  I guess it's not incredibly likely that psychologytoday's insurance information is wrong  but contacting your insurance directly is always the most secure way to go     Yeah it can be a weird weird thing lol  thanks for the advice Ugh I'm sorry  that really sucks  Honestly I think the only thing that helps is talking to people about it that understand your plight   I have the exact same thing   Perfectly fine all day  doing things   As soon as the sun drops  I get caught in negative thought loops about my life death and have a existential dread   I have been this way about two years now  but   It does get better   Now I can go days weeks without having a bout of fear   I hate it  but doing something that requires focus like competitive gaming helps me ignore the fear until I'm tired enough to fall asleep   Sorry if I can't give any help  but just talking about it will usually help     Just know that you aren't alone   Most people are just too stupid to realize they're going to die   They live in a haze just wondering around   Enjoying things   Lol   Go see a therapist   Try CBT   It might help   It helped me with the physical symptoms of anxiety starting into a panic attack  The short answer is Yes  The long answer is that although yes  it does make it worse  it's not something that you need to beat yourself up for every time you get the urge  You are going to seek reassurance and its ok that you have failed in the past  You are going to fail again in the future   I have tried medication and consistent exercise  exercise is better for my anxiety IMO but also meditation is very important to prevent reassurance seeking as well as anxiety  I strongly suggest you watch this link below as meditation is not a new age idea that you have to be buddha to perform  It is just a focus on being in the moment which can prevent pain in all of us   https   www youtube com watch v fXmG1x1ih1U  best of luck to you   remember to strive for constant improvement and forgive yourself when you fall short  I bought a set of adjustable weights for like  50  I can close the curtain and no one can see me    also I can play my own music    yahhhhhhh gyms give me panic attacks too Hello   I just finished posting also with some of the same symptoms  I completely understand the fear of heart problems  I have no solution  or advice really  But I saw this post 5 seconds after I posted mine    You're not alone   You could try counting to four billion and see how hard that is  Or you could compare how far we have come in 10 000 years of civilisation and imagine how long ago we'd likely have left the planet in four billion years time  We've effectively only used up 0 00025  of our civilisation time so far  and we can already drive remote vehicles around on Mars  and have identified hundreds of other potentially habitable planets  Just curious  why can't you move to Nebraska  I saw you post on another anxiety thread too  Are you a therapist  Or someone who has overcome SA  Just curious     Thank you for the great tip   I'm really sorry but I don't have a solution  but I can relate  I like to describe it as the angel and devil on the shoulders senario  The Angel is your rational  calm voice and the devil the panicking  irrational idiot that always seems to manage to drown out the angel  I have pretty much all day  every day  A constant civil war in my head  But it's mainly in concern with my heart flutters and skipped beats  Desperately trying to convince myself that it's just an anxiety flare up  I'm not going into heart failure  It's physically  emotionally and mentally exhausting   The only way I manage to keep it from becoming another terrified trip to ER  is to repeat what the doctor said the last time I was there 'you have lovely  strong rhythm from all four heart valves  and your bloods and ECGs are beautifully normal'  Doesn't stop the palpitations but it stops me from going 180 into pure panic  It's horrible though cos I have my two young children in bed right now  and that little devils voice keeps whispering 'yes but what if they doctors missed something and you die in your sleep  and the kids find you in the morning'   I'm sorry you're going through this  I wouldn't wish it on anyone xx Horror movie setting    I relate to that     Panic attacks  anything related to trauma    It is something very serious  and should not be dismissed  or be made fun of  or anything like that     hit the gym  or go out and meet someone else   you can make it all disappear tonight if you wanted  all you have to do is trust yourself and speak to a new person   hugsssss   "     "     "   yah i get that Thanks for taking the time to reply  I'm just sat up in bed right now trying to ignore the heart flutters  watching ghost hunters and doing some crochet  I feel like I'm silently fighting with this  so I don't end up falling apart again and taking myself back to the hospital  I hope you're ok and also finding some solace from my post xx yeah a little  im better at identifying it and going "oh I should calm myself down before it happens" now than I was before I responded surprisingly well to Anafranil  I did terrible on Luvox  which was also supposed to be the best     There are plenty of things to try  Some swear on Zoloft  Others loved Paxil  You have options  Maybe a med to augment yoyr current one   Hi carriebooper   You don't mention how old you are now  but I'm a little concerned at how much detail you included here   This is as safe a forum as we can make it  but it is public and we cannot stop others from reading through your experience with reasons other than to help and support you  I just want to make sure you understand that   That said  I am so very impressed with you for being able to write all this out   Some people go many years without being able to talk about what happened to them and this is a first step for you in healing   How are you feeling now having written it all out   I'm very sorry for what the guard did to you   I hope you know now that there was  nothing  legal or necessary about how he handled it   That was rape and abuse and  if you reported it  would carry a severe penalty for him   And anything you felt or experienced during what he did is very normal and nothing to feel ashamed of     This is not your responsibility  but if you are able to report him  you may be preventing him from doing this to many other little girls and saving them from what you are going through   I really recommend you think about going into some therapy with someone trained in sexual assault recovery   If you aren't sure about that  we can talk more about what that might be like   I'm glad you found us here and trusted this space with your very personal story   Please let us know how we can help you   Keep writing and ask any questions you have   All my best  not at all  if i'm alone for even a couple hours i get really sad  What about  this do you find funny  I do my best everyday to touch as little  as possible when I leave my house  Lysol wipes are a godsend   I was with my boyfriend's family and his friends for NYE  but it was super isolating because this past year has been really bad for me and my anxiety  especially when it comes to friendships  and just coming off from a very quiet birthday   Social obligations are so tough  and having social media doesn't help when so many people around you are seemingly loved so much more  I put way too much pressure on myself when it comes to interacting with others or making plans  It just upsets me and I don't feel any kind of happiness  even when during times when I'm actually seeing people  This is the blessing and curse of the anxious  we are so vigilant we want to protect Earth for billions of years       I have had the same fear  I have two kids  and I'm sure one day they will have kids  etc  and I think  will there be some awful time where some of my descendants can't live on Earth  How awful  what if I were living that right now  We're hypersensitive and put ourselves into the future   But let me tell you something  the time scale on which that will occur is so large that humans in the year 5 000 000 000  assuming there ARE humans then  will be unrecognizable to us today  If humans have survived that long  they will have figured out things we literally can't even imagine today  That may give you hope  not fear   Think about what humans from the 1500s would think of us today  great terrors have come  but great successes have as well  You  by your ancestors' survival of countless disasters  plagues  wars  injustices  are a miracle  Those ancestors didn't give up    So those humans in the year 2057  or 2141  or 252525  will wonder about us in "prehistory"  here in 2017  and may thank you for being vigilant about them   It may help you to think about Earth's distant past  and be amazed at how far life has come on Earth  so long as it doesn't stress you out   Instead of looking forward  look back  as New Year's custom dictates    I used to study astrophysics  so I find the distant future of the universe fascinating   Thanks  I'm feeling better now because in hindsight I do think I was justified   Heh      you lasted longer than I did   I went out by myself around 9   Stayed at the bar for 7 minutes until i started panicking  then went home and spent the rest of the night alone as i listened to fireworks and cheers outside my window   However stupid it was at least you said stuff  That's not at all a little thing   Congratulations  hugs  and Happy New Year   Thank you for sharing this   So many others here need to see that there are lights at the end of what sometimes feels like an endless tunnel   I'm very happy for you  Read this and have a few thoughts   1  You are not gay   2  You are also really bad at picking up social queues  Has this been something you have struggled with your whole life  If so it's something that you may want to think about   people with low confidence levels about certain things and or problems with social queues are more likely to be "used" than others  My guess is that the gay guy you are talking about thought your low confidence levels about women were a sign that you are unsure about your sexuality  this is not the case  Because you are not gay   3  HOCD is tough to deal with  it's one of the few types of OCD I have not personally experienced but I have heard others talk about it and you should not feel ashamed to have this problem in your life  It will go away  maybe not anytime very soon  but it will go away  You will need to work on it until it does   4  You are not "naive" or "passively submissive"  You have anxiety and it affects your decisions  You are also not objectively "nicer" than others even if you think you are and even if you are "nicer"  that's not really a good thing for you  You don't have to be an asshole or a misogynist to stop thinking about yourself this way  but as soon as you stop talking to yourself about how "nice" you are  you'll stop feeling "submissive" to others  You wouldn't be a homophobe in this situation to call this guy a sick fuck and tell him off  But you didn't do that and that's ok  because you learned from that and you won't do that again in the future   5  Homosexuality is not a light switch that you switch on and off  If you were gay you would be totally sure of it by now  Gay people know theyre gay by the time theyre 8  You're not gay even if you don't have a lot of experience with women   6  Watch this video   https   www youtube com watch v HZm4B4foybM t 2692s there are many things you can learn from this guy Leo  He's a life changer and his advice applies to everyone with any anxieties or insecurities or imperfections  The path to success in life  whether its relationships  or money  or strength  is the same   do what's difficult to do and continuously work toward self improvement  You don't want to be "used" by others you want to be empowered yourself  Nobody out there in the world will teach you that  they all have their own motivations and things they want from you  In the case of the fruitcake you were friends with  he wanted to see you naked   7  You're obviously attractive enough that a gay guy who looks good is attracted to you   this means that once you overcome your confidence issues  women will be more attracted to you as well  As you get older people will care less about how "social" you have been in the past   they care about how you see yourself  how you carry yourself  and how successful you believe you can be  You can be all of those things I can tell by reading what you have written  you may not see that now but in time and with dedication to self improvement you will   8  I'm not gay  I have a beautiful wife  I see other men all the time and have thoughts about the fact that they are attractive  So you have eyeballs  I also believe I am a nice person  But you know what  the world doesn't care  Once you find the girl that's right for you she will care that you are nice  but that's not going to help you at all on a first date   You're young and you have many successful days ahead of you   remember to focus on yourself and when you get negative thoughts  HOCD  POCD  ROCD  health anxiety  whatever comes your way  remember that you are not your worries and you will overcome them     If you have had a bad cold that can cause diarrhea  Post nasal drip  Mix that with cranberry juice and IBS and it's a recipe for disaster    Let me tell you  the week between Christmas and New Years has been hell on my guts  Stomach bug isn't likely since we have only left the house once and that was 4 days ago  But man oh man  Cookies and chocolate and spinach dip  Sometimes the holidays just make you feel like garbage   I have never ever had vomiting from an antibiotic  Maybe some intestinal issues but never throwing up   Thanks  it has been 1 year and 7 months  so it has taken awhile to get here  If sharing helps anyone even a little then I'm glad I did   Hi chickfactoring   It's really difficult to say to one person who's been through what you have what is "normal "  I often tell my clients that normal is exactly what you are going through because that is what's normal for you   We move into and out of feeling the impact of what happened to us over time   Sometimes it's so intense we can't bear it  sometimes it feels like nothing at all   I hesitate to say that what you are experiencing is a form of dissociation  which is when we are so disconnected from feeling that we think of what happened as though it was another person or we feel disconnected from ourselves now   It's possible that if you've spent time thinking about and writing about what happened to you  that you have gained some emotional distance from it   That's the ultimate goal of therapy  not to have the events disappear from your mind  but to be able to see them as a bad thing that happened that no longer affects your life today   So  yes  it's very normal   I suppose the question then becomes what  kind  of normal is it for were you are now   I hope this wasn't a confusing answer   It's sometimes so hard to make sense of our feelings as we move through the trauma   I can say this  you have nothing to feel guilty about  but it's also okay that you feel that way   All my best  That feeling of high alert is called hyperawareness  You are using the term "triggered" properly   Given how distressed you feel about what is happening  I encourage you to speak with your parents  if they are understanding about your diagnosis  about getting professional help  If that's not an option  take a look at a book called Healing Trauma  There's some good trauma reading if you do a little searching on Google   Edit  added missing word Also if anyone doesn't know  green tea is naturally has caffeine in it  I think it actually has more than regular coffee   Sounds like you may be physically dependent which is slightly different to addicted  It's still something you want to get help for   Yeah it's decaff not uncaff  There's a process to remove caffeine but they can't take it all out   Echoing everything  u tigalicious and  u TongaGirl wrote     You have every right to feel violated   I'm sorry your girlfriend isn't taking this seriously  and she should know that her not supporting you can affect your relationship   I typically recommend this guide to men who are struggling on how to support a woman they care about who was abused  but it may have some helpful information for her to better understand what you are going through   http   www capefearpsych org documents Rape mensguide pdf  For you  I would strongly recommend checking out the  r mengetrapedtoo which is a forum just like this one  specifically for men   All my best  Hi throwaway   You are being a really good friend during a very difficult time for her  so thank you for being there for her     As others here have written  what you  can  do is present her with options and be open to talking about them with her   What you  can't  do is make a decision for her  unless she is at some immediate risk of harm or injury   If you keep your focus on her being safe and supporting the decisions she makes  you will be on the right track   RAINN org is an excellent resource if she just needs to talk   She could also post here and receive ideas and feedback from us in a safe  supportive way   Something I'm going to recommend for you is this guide  http   www capefearpsych org documents Rape mensguide pdf  It's written for men to help them support a loved one or friend through rape   It's not long and will give you some direction on how to best support her   I also recommend you post to  r secondary survivors   It's a forum  similar to this one  but especially for loved ones of a rape victim versus the victim themselves   All my best  I would strongly support this decision as well   A lot of what you need to deal with is your emotional response to all of this   We can give you some guidance and feedback about how to handle some of these feelings and ideas about what to do  but the more in depth work really needs to happen with a psychotherapist trained in trauma sexual assault    Yes thanks for bringing that up  I caught a lot of flack over there actually because of how much my behavior spiraled out of controll  I was addicted to the dopamine reward of looking at nsfw subs  and even snapchatted 2 girls knowing they'd send me inappropriate photos  It was never about the people  just the thrill  I came clean of course and it entered into us breaking up  but she knows I wasn't being myself at all  and has forgiven me for that behavior as I work towards being my best self  Since the break up though I have been dealing with intrusive thoughts and obsessive rumination  so definitely characteristics of OCD type thinking  At ROCD though only one person replied and called me a shitty person  This is super common with anxiety  It is difficult to challenge yourself when you are already assuming the worst outcome  Two methods have always worked for me   1  Complete small tasks everyday  For starters make your bed  eat breakfast  tidy up  Write these down on a piece of paper  Cross them off as you complete them  Then continue on your day  After awhile these tasks will raise your self confidence and energy  at least it has always helped me   I always try to do atomething different once a week  I went to a hockey game that I was invited to 2 hours before hand  That was terrifying  but I did it  I went and broke it up  I created little tasks like get to the car  drive to stadium  meet friends  watch game  drive home  relax    2  Exposure therapy really worked for me  I'm currently an international student and customs and visa process stuff always made me anxious  I broke that by going to the immigration office to apply for student permit instead of online so I can experience it and go against it  It's not the best way cuz as you said  it can go either way  When it comes to social aspects  I recommend going out to dinner with a friend  Talk to the waiter or waitress  they WANT to talk to you to try and get a better tip  They are perfect options for working on talking to others and meeting new people  If you get overwhelmed  just walk away and go to the washroom and take a breathe and try again    It is a process and that is the worst part as time never seems to be on your side  I can tell you that over time  it gets better  When I look back 5 or 10 years  my anxiety was much worse  It's much better now  I'm on my phone so I can't get too much details  Feel free to pm me if you have questions or anything  Always glad to help  Also sorry if grammar is bad  phone    Medications are different for everyone  I personally have taken a number of medications  Zoloft  Prozac  Effexor  Luvox  even Klonopin at one point which I would highly not recommend over the long run   None have worked as well as consistent exercise  meditation  and refraining from abusing substances such as Marijuana and Alcohol   But no  not everyone responds well to Anafranil  and even if you did respond well to it there is no magic pill to cure OCD   the only cure is healthy habits  mindfulness patience  and acceptance  For some  medication can help  even help greatly  but I have yet to see someone with OCD who has been cured by medication and medication alone   I found during the times when I took medication that I expected to have the medication do the work for me  and as a result did not do the tough mental work of confronting my illness head on  I am not suggesting that this is true for everyone or even most people  but I think there is a temptation for anyone with a mental illness to think that one medication is the right one for them and will solve their problems   I recommend meditating for 20 minutes per day  even if you don't see the value in it for a long time  I am six months in and the first three months felt like a total waste of time  but I am glad I continued  Here is a very helpful link that has changed my life   https   www youtube com watch v fXmG1x1ih1U t 7s I have the same thing  a nice souvenir from an abusive relationship   Since coming out of the relationship its actually gotten worse  I also feel your pain of people not understanding  I stopped dating a guy after he raised his voice at me because I couldnt see him in the same way anymore  He wasnt angry at me  he was angry at someone else and venting at me  so he didnt understand why I left  But I just cant take being shouted at  Its so bad now that I start getting shaky when anyone is annoyed at me  Im hoping itll get better as I move on and learn that abusive relationships are not the norm  Yep I'm definitely hitting the gym and going out and meeting people and it helps  But my unconscious mind is still messed up about the previous girl   Example  I was having sex with a random hookup and couldn't get hard because of the anxiety  not performance anxiety but my general breakup anxiety  Not wrong  but not right either  He is having struggles with talking to people which is a symptom of SA  He means that his SA is stopping him from talking to the girl and wants to know how not to freeze like he does   No need to be rude  Maybe you and she should see a therapist or a counselor  If the anxiety isn't affecting other areas of her life  she doesn't need medication  which makes things simpler   It's true  Also  for those who don't know  mild roast coffee has more caffeine than dark roast   Pure caffeine   mild roast   medium roast   dark roast   decaf I feel like mines the opposite and no matter how much water I drink my mouth is still dry   Right on  good to know there are more people going through the same types of thought process  It's funny you should bring up vulnerability though  because lack of willingness to show that and shame for my actions were causing my anxiety to go out of control  You've probably seen it  but this is an amazing TED talk on it  https   www youtube com watch v iCvmsMzlF7o  Damn thank you so much for the words of encouragement  I've heard that a couple times but it's so hard to put into practice  How do you motivate yourself when you feel like your not libing a life for many good reasons  I'm in a city where I have only one good friend  and my work is great but a little reptetive at times lately  You're right though  Just being the person I know I can be though I think will bring me so much happiness  The idea of loving yourself is so so important too  so you hit the nail on the head there  Not only will working out make you more confident though  but it's also a great endorphin boost   I'm glad to hear that setting small goals for yourself each day is working out well for you  That's something that's going to be absolutely essential for me to do in order to not feel completely alone in my city  Onwards an upwards I suppose   Ha I'm so happy to hear that you're in this boat  I'm less likely to feel like sinking it knowing that you'd go down with me    I will say that I laid it all on the line today with her via email  Told her that I have to work on myself  but would love to think we can have a future together still  I know how much I have to focus on myself first  but over the past 4 weeks i've been able to really come into a sense of clearness about my behavior patterns  just wanted her to know how dedicated I am I guess  Definitely made me feel extremely vulnerable though  Just out of interest  as you sound like an expert journaller and I'm only really just starting out   what would you say are the best things to talk about in a journal  Questions to ask yourself etc  Do you journal when you're feeling bad  or reflect on it afterwards   I've had mixed results journaling whilst anxious compared to afterwards  Usually my journalling is really productive while anxious  and all my thoughts are racing in my head  However  when I'm in an irritable anxious state my journalling is unproductive  I don't find journalling while ok productive as I can't recreate the feelings and thoughts I had previously to note them down  Sounds like classic symptoms of anxiety   I would suggest a combination of medication  under the care of a psychiatrist that specializes in anxiety and not a regular dr   and CBT  cognitive based therapy    Managing anxiety is partially a skill you have to learn   It will never go away but you can learn how to deal effectively   You need to think of this like managing a long term disease like diabetes and not something you 'fix'      Hey again   I was wondering about how long Trintellex or Effexor's bad effects lasted  I took Cymbalta more than 48 hours ago and I still feel pretty bad  At this point I'm trying to figure out whether it's a medication reaction or whether I'm just sick  Hi again  would you mind if I asked how long your reaction to Prozac lasted  It's been more than 48 hours since I took Cymbalta and I'm still feeling sick  At this point I'm trying to figure out whether it's a medication reaction or whether I'm just sick  I really wish i got the benefit of journaling that other people get  When I was seeing a therapist I spent as much time I could journaling  I filled up 3 80pg notebooks in as many months  and all my therapist had to say was something along the lines of     Sounds like you have a good handle on what your issues are  Keep up the good work   I didn't get anything profound out of it  nothing added by my therapist  So it seemed like a waste of paper  I'm sorry about your situation OP  I'm not sure I can be of much help  I only ever respond negatively to sexual touch because I'm self conscious of how I look or if I can perform sexually  due to anxiety   I can see this being something I might have to deal with myself though in the future so I will wish you the best and keep an eye on this thread  Agreeing with everything  u FreeOppression wrote     You are going through a traumatic re victimization of what happened to you  but now through the images of her assault  as you imagine it   This has caused your anxiety to come to the surface full force   The good news is that because you have already been through this  your recovery time should be much faster   You know how to get through this  you just need the professional support to do it   I realize you want to be there for her  but having one person in the world to rely on isn't the best prescription for healing   I would encourage you to encourage her to talk her therapist about what happened to her   My guess is that if her therapist knows something about trauma  they are probably already aware that there is something she isn't saying  that would make their treatment much more fruitful   As long as you are her only support  it's more difficult for her to move forward   Keep talking and writing   All my best  Sometimes it takes a long time to find meds that work for you   I've been on roughly 50 medications over the course of 15 years and it wasn't until last year that we found ones that really work for me   You just have to keep trying   So to answer your question  no  two particular meds not working for you does not mean you're out of luck   There are lots and lots of medications out there and they all affect people differently    Yep  happens to me  too  I'm very aware of any sensation in my mouth or throat  I blame emetophobia  How much you love your kids has so much more to do with their quality of life than how much money you  or any parent  have   Your kids will be blessed with many things throughout their life and I'm sure you can teach them to notice   I'm not religious  but I like to think that "Solomon in all his glory"  part of a Bible verse comparing his clothing to the lilies of the field  I don't remember where it is  didn't know the comforts of the most basic modern household like indoor plumbing for toilets and hot showers and heat controlled by a thermostat   If children have modern comforts  and  the unconditional love of a good parent  they're doing better than 99 9  of humans that ever lived  Thanks for the response  I understand what you're saying but I don't feel as though this is just a period or a phase that I'm in  this is how almost my entire life has been so far  How did you change things in your own life  I feel the same way  And people being angry at me makes me afraid of them  I actually get the opposite of this  When I find something new I get   REALLY REALLY   obsessed with it for a while  Like Ive ruined a relationship by moving too fast  I know EVERY song by a band within a week of discovering they exist I find that this fades over time  and Im not sure if its anything to do with anxiety  or if anyone else feels the same  Yes Also the bus  It's a nightmare and i only use it for 10 minutes a day I can't touch anything there Please check out codependent   Google it   This might or might not be Your problem but it is worth looking into as Your problem is relationship based   There are 12 Step programs to help deal with codependence   I think Melanie Beattie is the name of the author that has written several good books on the topic  The book that clandestine12 mentioned is an awesome recommendation    As you have no doubt noticed  trying not to think about the situation doesn't really work that well    Codependence is a problem I deal with too  It is not fun but it can be managed and there is a way out of the torment   Good luck   I get the same way  as a side effect of growing in a household with constant yelling  It's now been 14 years since I've moved out and I still get panic attacks around people yelling  even if not directed at me   The best I can advise is to distance yourself from people like that  I think the biggest thing you need to do is stop practicing the compulsion  Let yourself think about his name  It's going to cause you anxiety  But the more you try not to think his name and give into those compulsions the more you feed your OCD and the stronger it becomes  Don't think of thinking of your ex as the problem  think of the problem is your OCD  It doesn't matter whether or not it's normal to be thinking about your ex at this point or not  You got this  These are a few tips I give to loved ones who want to support and be there for someone who is just opening up about their abuse    Listening with an open mind and a heart full of love to what they need to say in the way they need to say it    Using encouraging and supportive phrases so they know you are safe to talk to     Do not question or judge what he says   If parts don't make sense or you have your own emotional reaction  keep that to yourself until you can make sense of it   The focus is on his needs  not on your understanding    For a man to speak with another man about sexual abuse can raise fears that they will be judged on their masculinity   "Real men defend themselves " and other sorts of nonsense   Be aware he may have these fears and do your best to let him know that he is being brave now by talking about this   Simply opening up to you and being listened to and loved will do him a world of good in moving forward in healing    Encourage him to see a therapist who specializes in the trauma of sexual abuse  especially if they have experience working with males    Depending on what he says  you  could  raise the idea of reporting his abuser   Especially as it's a good bet that your brother wasn't the only kid he did this to   It's your brother's choice  but it's an option he may not have considered   Those are some basics   If you stick to those  you'll be on a good track to helping him   It's okay to cry with him and for him  but not for "your poor brother" out of pity   He's had the strength to make it through til now   And now he's reaching out   Give him a strong hand   This guide is written for men to support women through a rape sexual assault  but will have some good tips for you as well   Take a look  http   www capefearpsych org documents Rape mensguide pdf   Keep asking questions and writing here   If your brother would like some online help as well  he could post to  r mengetrapedtoo   They are a forum similar to this one  especially designed for men   All my best  I am so sorry this has happened to you  I understand how horrid you must be feeling  Remember that this is NOT your fault at all  no matter how drunk you are or who you chose to sleep with   what that man did is absolutely wrong on all levels  Can I ask if you have gone to get a rape kit done  or have thought about it  If you don't want to go ahead with prosecution right now  you can still get a rape kit done and then decide later  or never  to go to the police with it   If you are in the UK I can help with this and let you know what to expect   Sending my love to you  You sound so much like me  Im pretty much the same in my relationship  The first thing I can say is that checking his texts will only make you worse  you dont mention him ever being unfaithful  so Im not sure you can justify sifting through his messages  Please try to stop this as youll want to keep doing it  and its not healthy  sometimes its better just to not know  The other thing thats helped me is keeping a journal  I keep it on Google Drive and share it with my boyfriend  Then he can look at it and read my worries and insecurities  without me actually having to muster up the courage and talk to him about it  My only rules are that Ill never complain about him on there so he cant respond  thats unhealthy  and that he can bring up anything in person hes read on there and well talk about it  It means I can feel like Im getting stuff off my chest without venting to him and pushing him away putting pressure on him   Id be happy to talk more about it  as I always worry Im pretty much the only girlfriend in the world that acts like this   Here are some of my goals that I want to achieve  1  Get a different job  2  Be less depressed  3  Don't be so worried about what others might think of me 4  Realize that its just panic attacks and to stop thinking that something is really wrong with me  5  Last year I finally actually got the confidence to ask a girl out so this year I want to continue not giving up and improve my social anxiety   Have you gone to therapy  You CAN have the things you want  it will just take a shit ton of work   Thank you for being a good friend to her  Your love and willingness to ask others for advice is very admirable  Have you talked to her about getting a rape kit done  She can always have it stored at the facility  and never involve the authorities if she doesnt want to  but it gives her the option to persue at a later point if she chooses to   Same here  They don't even have to be yelling at me  Just a raised voice  My earliest memory of this was hearing my dad yell at the TV downstairs when football was on  Made my heart stop   I had pretty much the same problem  My mum found out about my anxiety 2 years ago and denied it existed until a couple of months ago when she saw it first hand  There is a wonderful video on TheMighty about High Functioning Anxiety which may be useful to show her  Otherwise  I recommend confiding your worries when you've had a crap day to her  My mum started to recognise patterns in her own and my dad's thinking  and that may have been what changed her mind  It may take her a while   she's your mum so she likes to think she knows you  It might be hard for her to accept she doesn't know you as well as she thinks she does  but I think she will come round  I really hope she does  This comes down to your philosophy as a parent   Do you believe it is worth telling "white lies" to your child to protect them allow them to enjoy childhood or do you believe they deserve an honest account of the world  even if it doesn't include every detail     I became a certified foster parent and after lots of thinking  the foster parent classes ask you to delve into yourself for a lot of answers to things you might never hopefully never have to use   I chose the latter   This question is one of the more simple questions and something every parent is going to deal with  so it is good to know your answer before you have difficult conversations   This even comes down to simple things like whether your kids believe in Santa and it is okay to have the first answer for certain circumstances and the second answer for others     From what you wrote and my philosophy  I would tell a six year old something like this  "I know you liked        but he can't see us anymore   It might be hard for you to understand  but he made a big mistake   He acted like he was going to hurt me  which is very serious   Because he acted like he was going to hurt me  he isn't allowed to see us any more   It doesn't mean that he doesn't love us  but he didn't know how to consistently show that he loves us   I know you love me   You know that I love you   We aren't going to be separated because we won't hurt each other  so I don't want you to worry   If you have any questions or want to talk about this  I'm here for you   If you don't have a question today  but think of one later  you can ask me when you think of it   Is that okay   Is there anything you want to ask or say " Have you tried talking to a doctor  I think that's your best option  I've never heard of CBT  Thank you for responding  I'm looking into it now    Hi blue   Our sexual orientation or "preference" is a spectrum  but it is also fairly hard wired into who we are at birth   That's as much as we know about the genetics of it now   Possibly future research will teach us more   However  most of human history shows us that people  given a healthy  supportive outlet for expression  express their sexual orientation the same way throughout their lives     I'm not saying all that to change anything you're saying  just to put it in context   Certainly  there are people who "become aware" that they are gay later in life  but that's typically due to an attempt to conform to societal standards before that   All of that to say that what  is  more usual  is that when we've been through a sexual trauma  it can cause us  at a very deep level  to rethink how to avoid that trauma   In the case of sexual assault  an obvious way becomes to avoid becoming involved with someone of the gender that hurt us   It's not at all unusual for women to avoid being with men for some period of time after their assault  and for some  especially without therapy to work through the trauma  they stick with that decision for a long time     That's where the "could I be a lesbian " or "would I be willing to try a lesbian relationship " questions can come up     The chemical changes trauma causes can shift us absolutely  but they are typically shifting us away from whatever hurt us   Not changing our fundamental personality or orientation   My guess is that as you continue to work through what happened to you  you will slowly find yourself considering relationships with men again   Safe  caring men who you can have trust in   None of this is to say that you couldn't explore dating women to see how far these new feelings go   But from what you wrote  I get the strong impression that you are looking for safe relationships  not a sexual one with a woman   Does this make sense    I am so sorry this has happened to you  Just reading your post gives me anxiety   Drs in general give me anxiety and having to have an appointment for my meds makes me so anxious  I wish they would understand that if a person is taking anxiety meds then they should just give them a freakin refill  You can't just stop those meds cold turkey  Again  I am so sorry for you  I hope it gets worked out as soon as possible   I had this crazy manager at work pull me into a stockroom  slam the door  and scream in my face for like 5 minutes  I walked out crying and had a full blown episode for the rest of my shift  Took me 45 mins to stop crying   SSRI withdrawals are no joke     Usually they taper you off    I know I'm oblivious  Most times I assume flirting is just them being nice  not them showing interest   I'll comfort you    I've had that same feeling throughout my whole life  People yelling and then I get real nervous and unsteady and the anxiety skyrockets through the roof  then I am suddenly quiet and think I am worthless piece of shit that can't do anything correctly and I just want to cry and end up getting suicidal thoughts    Run on sentance much  I know how you feel  It is a terrible terrible feeling that no one should have to deal with    I'm 25 M and feel like such a pussy when this happens    Time is your friend  You can't make it come any faster and you can't slow it down  It sucks  I know it's not the answer you want to hear but it's what will get you through the day    I've made some pretty irrational decisions from incidents stemming from people getting pissed at me  yelling included     I'm here for you  mainly because it's comforting knowing that there is someone out there that feels the same way as me  Finding this community was one of the biggest steps forward of understanding why I am the way I am  Message if you'd like  I will do my best to respond promptly   You are definitely not alone  Anxiety attacks are awful  I often feel like no one understands how I feel  I don't know if you are religious at all  but I find that repeating a scripture calms me down  If you aren't  repeating anything that you find comforting might help   I know it's not a space  but i bring items that I usually have in that safe space  Sometimes it's my stuffed turtle i can hug in the car  or i have this little kitty stuffie my sister gifted me i can hold in my pocket so no one notices  This necklace i wear all the time with a rose quartz crystal used in crystal healing for love and especially self love  and although I don't believe too much in crystal healing I believe in the placebo of it  Really anything you can think of  you could bring  A lot of the time i'll bring crochet projects i'm working on for my safe space like a blanket for my bedroom  keeps my mind focused and centred on my room and the feelings it gives me  Sending happy thoughts and love   Is there a video  generally  as low self esteem and extreme lack of confidence    The same thing happens with me  I've had to constantly remind myself that people aren't mad at me and that yelling is often a way for people to express themselves  I feel lost when my SO is angry or upset about something totally outside of me  He might be grumpy or be explaining his situation to me and raising his voice out of frustration with the situation  not angry with me at all  but I always feel small  Sometimes I can't be as supportive or as good of a listener because I'm dealing with my own feeling of being scared like a child again  I'm getting better at reminding myself things don't always revolve around me and that I don't have to choose to be scared or offended by other's frustration   Bro this kind of happened to me one time when i was meetin a bunch of girls with my friend at a bar and when i sat down in an empty chair  one girl was like "someones sitting there" i replied "well why tf is nobody sitting here then"  Activated my anger more than my anxiety but my anxiety wouldnt let me express my anger  Eventually the girl said she was just kidding but id never even met her so i thought it was kind of weird shed do that joke  But anyways  i can relate to your feeling Fuck it whenever I see someone in Heely's I wish they made a comeback What  u komorebi731 wrote is excellent advice    Including the high five to roommate  another from me    What your abuser is displaying are  very  typical stalker behaviors   He can't get through to you  so now he's trying another avenue close to you   I don't find it "weird " that he found her  I find it highly suspicious and completely deliberate on his part   This is intentional behavior designed to create fear in you and to get to you   There should be no communication from anyone  except as was suggested a clear "leave me and my friends alone "  One time   I would also suggest asking your family or other friends who knew him to let you know if he attempts to contact them   Save all messages from your roommate and yourself  if you still have them   If it continues at all  go to the police  show them the messages  and request a restraining order with a no digital contact clause     I don't say this to scare you  but to protect you   Often people do not take these situations seriously until something more intrusive happens     Definitely talk with your therapist about it   You are not overreacting   Keep writing and asking questions if we can be more helpful   All my best  People who are angry are often just mad at themselves just walk away I've taken 3 pills each of the last 3 days  I work night shift  50mg    Definitely been stressed  even so  the last 3 days have been some of the best sleep I've had in awhile  I'm getting 5 7 hours as opposed to 4 5   I usually wake up every hour or two  the first day I still did that  but I was able to fall back asleep in just a minute or two  Still felt panicked when I woke up  but WAY less    The last 2 days however I slept the whole time  haven't done that in months   In general my depression seems better  didn't expect that  especially after only 3 days  maybe it's just from better sleep  My anxiety is MUCH better  that was the biggest factor    I read in several places where people called it a miracle drug  best thing ever for their situation  which sounded like mine  I wouldn't go that far with it  but it has definitely met my expectations  and takes the edge off just enough for me to function normally again    I would say for some with major depressive disorder  like me  that's also got some anxiety and sleep trouble  this so by far the best thing I've had  When I stopped Effexor for the second time  I took St  John's Wort  B Complex  Aleve  Fish Oil  and lots of Green Tea  It helped a lot I think   If you want advice  use this opportunity to notice how even though  there was a negative result  you are still you   your value hasn't gone down  etc  and you're still alive  etc    If you just want someone to talk to  I'm sorry you had a shitty new years and that that happened  I broke cultural traditions a lot on accident when I lived abroad and was dating someone there  it is so anxiety inducing and even shameful sometimes  you're not trying to offend anyone but it's like it'll happen regardless of what you do  It sounds like it's more so their fault for not letting you know  I hope the rest of your year is better  It's a symptom of anxiety  Happens to me all the time   It's not that uncommon for people with OCD to ruminate on unwanted images  which just causes them more distress  That happened to me where I would ruminate on the thought of the person I was in love with having sex with someone  It may sound like heartbreak  but OCD obsessiveness definitely contributed  I would think about it almost all the time  and it always made me feel panicked and sick   I don't know if this will help in your situation  but what helped me was warping the image in my head into something else  When I would picture them having sex  I would make the hair on my friend longer  change his facial features  and then give him some crazy name that would make me laugh  This way  since it turned into someone else having sex  it didn't bother me  It's hard for me to say because my doctor had me start on a smaller dose of Lexapro and increase it a bit each day as I was lessening the Effexor  So  I felt bad for two     days until I started feeling more stabilized due to the Lexapro  Effexor has a shorter half life compared to Lexapro  so I would hope it is not too long for you  I was only on it three weeks  though  I've read stories online from people who have been on it a long time and felt bad coming off it  As survivors we tend to minimize what we experienced  I don't know for certain but it may be a way of coping   If the same had happened to your sister or friend  would you minimize it  Maybe spend some time thinking about what you would say to someone if they came to you to share the same situation of abuse   Sexual abuse doesn't have to be violent  He coerced you into complying by threatening to kill himself if you didn't comply  He did not have your voluntary permission to engage in sexual acts  That is what makes his behavior sexual assault   He also tried to convince you that engaging in these acts would be good for your anorexia  Not physical force but definitely coercion   I wish you the best with your psychotherapy  Continue to take good care of yourself  Hi MintGiraffe   Welcome to the forum   Thank you for introducing yourself and telling us about your background   I'm the lead mod for  rapecounseling and also a mod for  rape   It's always great to have more support here  especially someone with your background and understanding of the complexities of sexual trauma   In the states  we call what you do an "advocate " but it sounds like you have more training and education than a standard advocate here   An advocate here goes through a 40 80 hr training  depending on the work they will be doing  either in person support  hotline work  med exam support  or additional domestic violence intervention   If you're open to it  what I'd recommend outside of your post  is simply to read through the posts and comment as needed given their situation   I wish I had more time to devote to this  which is why it's so appreciated and amazing when people step forward to help   Happy New Year   And feel free to ask me anything you'd like about the forums   All my best  Good advice Good news  went to the ER and they refilled my meds no problem  Even the lady who checked me in said "Honey  I understand and  I'm grateful for my medication" and then squeezed my hand  Her compassion filled me with strength to keep fighting this awful illness  I'm at the pharmacy now  Thank you for your kind words  though I'm sorry I caused you anxiety  There's hope for us  never forget that  I wish you a well controlled  symptom New Year    Look up the affects of overdose for your medication  I'd recommend waiting for your appointment but if you're going to do it anyway you should understand the risks  I'm pretty similar  When I was talking to the gen doc's therapist  I explained how I had tried to get myself to do exposure  but it often backfired  She made a point that made me stop completely  "yes  exposure is a great way to get over anxiety  but you sometimes have to be prepped to do it  You haven't been seeing a therapist  and so you're just throwing yourself to the wind without understanding what steps you should be taking " It really opened my eyes that for someone like me  who is a planner  I can't just throw myself into situations I don't understand haven't discussed with someone who better understands  I still do slight exposure exercises  but I don't do something new without  well  planning  I talk to my therapist  I research common ways to manage the situation you're going into  etc  Don't think that exposure is the only way  If it's not working out for you and making it worse  then you need to not do it  It's okay  there are tons of other ways to go  cbt works wonders for me   I think the biggest thing I have learned in my life is that happiness isn't about becoming a better version of yourself or necessarily changing who you are  it's about looking at yourself without judgement  really getting to know yourself  and being comfortable in your own skin  Us people with SA are notoriously bad about negative self talk  Self compassion is one of the most rewarding habits you can practice  And that's the other thing  It's all a practice  Everyday you have to love yourself  every day you have to tell yourself you are worth it  and everyday you have to remind yourself to just go do that thing you want to do  Don't think about it  don't try to do it  DO IT  If your brain kicks in with "but what if " Tell it to shut up  and just do the things that make you feel good  Your brain will always win and keep you down if you let it  So just tell it to shut up for a while  Sorry meant Cognative behavioral therapy   Brain fart Good for you  I have anxiety about posting on Facebook but on Reddit I'm fine I've had moments where I'd bottleneck because I had so much I wanted to do  what usually happens is you do something that motivates you to do another thing  So I'd say the first two things would be a license and drinking  Smoking is harder of course  If you get your license you have a better chance to get a job  Get a job  and slowly come off of smoking    And I wouldn't consider what was said shortcomings  You having this attitude towards wanting to change is much more then most people have when in a rut  Someone in my life is stuck in a rut and they have no drive or desire to change     A lot of baby steps can equal a mile  Take your time and take bites out of what you want to do  Thank you so much  This is really helpful to read  and validating  and reassuring  and comforting  You take care too   We met playing an online game  we stayed up all night talking  then spent the next ten months talking everyday  We tried to just talk every second day but it wasn't enough  We met in person and it was basically perfect  Don't get me wrong  I was so insanely nervous before I met him that I curled up in a ball and called my best friend out of a meeting  I drank an apple cider in the shower and had a full scale anxiety attack during dinner  But it went away  And then it was just gone   I went on some dates  not a lot  I was always too shy  If it started getting close with a guy I would usually make fun of him or find another way to push him away  Just to stop the panic  I would like to know others' thoughts on this as well  It's something I've been considering  I've been afraid to try because it makes the thoughts more "real" in some sense  Like  they're out there on a page  virtual or otherwise   But I'm going through a real rough patch right now and I could use the help that journaling may be able to provide  I guess I'm just restating what was already said  If you have a bit of spare cash  should be about  150 500 ish dollars depending on how good of a bike you want   you could get an exercise bike  I love mine  It's a Schwinn  It works amazing  but that brand is pretty expensive  got it at a clearance price though which was pretty great   It does have loads of settings though  and resistance levels that shift at the push of a button   Exercise bikes are amazing   you don't have to go outside  so no worries about running into people or  if you're like me and your throat can't handle the cold air  you won't have throat pains  They're also a lot easier on your joints  because they don't have to carry your full weight  I have joint issues so even at a normal weight mine aren't friendly to long walks or running   Another great thing about exercise bikes is that you can do other things to keep your mind off the 'burn' of the workout  Want to watch TV  Want to play games  You can  Bring out that handheld or console and go to town  I biked over 11 miles today because the new Pokemon game distracted me  That's way more than i've done in a LONG time  normally I go for 2 5 miles about 3x week    I would also recommend a small set of weights  I have 5 lb weights because whatever health issue I have makes it so I can't really handle much more than that without my joints feeling like they're being pulled apart       But they do make me feel better  I'm also planning on getting a stress ball  to try to strengthen my finger joints   If you don't have money to buy things  all is not lost  Dance is free  as is yoga  and much more  You could try looking up exercise routines on Youtube  Great advice  Thanks for posting that  Wow  congratulations  You definitely should be proud     Yes  All I'm thinking about is how I used to go to wild New Years parties have fun  flirt with girls  be relaxed  All of this seems impossible to me now and I'm just alone Me  Yes    For me  it comes from a traumatic childhood  I try to remind myself that I'm a grown up now  and I can keep myself safe  Also  I won't hesitate to completely cut off someone who makes me feel unsafe in every way I can  Whether that's blocking a dickhead on FB or shutting off emotionally from a coworker  etc   That's sucks man   hi  thanks for your concern which i did consider but i needed so badly to finally let it out of me that i went ahead   i can always not log on if somebody tries to bother me   i do know the whole thing was bullshit now of course  but i'm not sure about therapy just yet   i do feel a little better so far   very selfishly  i haven't tried to report what happened because having everyone in my life know about it is just not something i can consider as a possibility   which i also feel pretty shitty about  You say it could have been worse  but there aren't too many worse things than a "friend" threatening to kill themselves if you don't do what they want   That is a violent form of blackmail with an insidious twist to it   He may not have directed the actual violence at you  but he did threaten you with violence   Towards himself   And then tried to say that it was for your good   This is an extremely manipulative and horrible way to treat someone you say you care about   He used your vulnerabilities against you   It's very little different from how adults will manipulate children in grooming them for sex   Not that you are a child  but that this was his approach demonstrates clearly he had no interest in your well being   He was willing to torture you emotionally so that he could get what he wanted sexually     It was violent and abusive   Just in a way that made you doubt yourself   Which makes it harder to pin down and more confusing than if he just hit you   This is why emotional and psychological abuse are often harder to recover from than straight physical abuse   I hope this helps you to re contextualize what he did   It's one thing for us to contemplate hurting ourselves and another entirely to be made to feel responsible for someone else's life   Good luck on your narrative   I use those often with my clients and they are very helpful in getting your experience down where you can better see it   All my best  Good on you for taking that step  I'm proud and I hope one day too I can go to the movies without having Anxiety    Nice job  Do you feel like you could take on other classes now   I think you should definitely do it  Not only would it help you  but it would also most likely aid in breaking barriers  and maybe someone you have on facebook sees your post and decides to post about their experiences with anxiety as well  Keeping the lines of communication and breaking the stigma is one of many things we as a collective need to work on  and even small things like posting on facebook about it helps  albeit on a smaller scale than you'd imagine   Either way it still makes a difference  I take benzodiazepines as needed for anxiety  It works for me  I have mostly good days  but sometimes I have a string of bad days where a low dose  usually 0 5 1 MG  helps me function  I have concerns about taking an every day maintenance medication  stems from my abusive mother  she was prescribed Prozac and made me take her prescription as a child with some negative side effects  so feeling like I have control over the dosing stopping the medication when I want is best  I've read posts where people act like you take benzos once and you're hardcore addicted  but that is not my experience  I take them every day for 2 7 days  then not for 10 15 days  etc    I was nervous about talking to my doctor  but when I finally did  it was SO routine to him  He didn't judge me or make me feel bad  I felt very empowered by finally admitting I needed some help  Along with that  a vigorous exercise routine and mindfulness practices help me manage my anxiety   I'm too embarrassed to say this at therapy  I'm bad at it  I don't want people knowing things about me lke this I personally found the beta blocker propranolol helpful  Traditional psych meds have never worked for my OCD anxiety  I ran out of other options and in the hospital  the psychiatrists asked if I wanted to try something different  I didn't have anything else to do  so I agreed  Best decision I've made   I suggest getting into therapy with a therapist who specializes in sexual trauma  A great workbook that helped me a lot is Resurrection After Rape by Matt Atkinson  If you ever need someone to talk to  I'm here for you  You can get through this   Thank you  I believe in you  Baby steps    A fellow shadow lurker I can second this  lol I am pretty sensitive to people's anger as well  Not just yelling  but when I sense someone getting upset or frustrated it bothers me so much and I get all worked up  I catch myself reacting to anger before I even process what I am doing sometimes   For example  one day my boyfriend got the car stuck in snow while we were driving  and he loudly and angrily said a single swear word  I immediately started telling him it was okay and not to get upset  but then started processing and realized it's totally okay to get upset in that situation  It really made me think about the way I react to things and start working on that with cognitive behaviour therapy  Do NOT just taking them  It can shock your brain  and my doctor told me that it's "the equivalent of throwing your brain off a bridge "   You have to taper  Slow and steady    Trust me  I did that and it was the worst thing that I could've done   If 2016 taught me one thing  it's that I'm not capable of being happy on my own  I simply don't possess the right skills to be able to live a fulfilling and successful life  it's unfortunate but it's just the way I turned out  thanks mom and dad  I need someone something to hold my hand and walk me through the dark  because apparently I'm blind   2017 goals   1  Talk to a psychiatrist psychologist therapist whateverist to finally confront my shit  including SA of course  depression  self esteem image issues  what's causing me to self harm  and  possibly  unresolved childhood traumas    2  Go back on SSRIs  3  Drink more  I know this is a very terrible solution that will most definitely turn me into an alcoholic  but I don't know if I can or want to stop  Even just a drink or two works wonders for me and turns night into day  not necessarily in regards to how I act but mainly how I feel  Not even at the point of being drunk  just "mellowed out " just something to take the edge off  and it is a very sharp edge   The danger here is that once I start drinking  once I realize how good I feel  I just want more  I just figure "if it makes me feel increasingly awesome  why not keep going " and it's amazing at first feeling completely at ease and confident and attractive like a normal person  but before I know it I'm on my knees in the bathroom at 4am throwing up in the toilet and waking up the next morning in my clothes with a headache and upset stomach feeling this horrible mix of guilt and shame and disappointment in myself  then I do it again a week later  I just need to learn how to drink socially and in moderation   This is on point  Exactly how it goes  Grr How often does it happen for you  I actually am doing fantastic on Luvox   I definitely agree that it takes time to find the right "fit "  Everyone's brain is different  You shouldn't be embarrassed  You can't help that you have OCD  but you can help the degree to which it affects your life  Trust me  therapists have heard much weirder  I know it may seem embarrassing but once you get it out there and start getting help you'll be glad you did     I have a PRN medication hydroxizine  And trazadone was prescribed but I didn't care to start it  Hi  Sorry to hear about your struggles and your friend  I hope your friend is doing okay    I mean this respectfully  but can you update your psychiatrist when you get the chance  Do your best and be as proactive as you can be  You don't have to wait until your next appointment to tell your psychiatrist how you're doing  You can call and leave a message  or you can write a note and drop it off at their office  Fuck them for not letting you know  Also fuck them again for paying attention to something so trivial as if it makes any difference where someone sits  I feel the same way  Whenever someone is mad at me it's all I can think about  I actually can't focus on anything else   They know about my OCD and stuff but the drawing is embarrassing because I'm really bad at it What do you mean update him  Also my friend is doing well     Both are excellent  I have been taking buspar for past 3 months and generally feel less anxious and am a fan  It can make me feel a little dizzy at times but is manageable  I have been taking propranolol for large speaking engagements and or big meetings for the past 25 years  The pre speaking jitters are virtually gone  Love it and recommend to everyone I know  Good luck   I gotta save this to post on it  I'm in that exact same boat   The buddy system is the best way to learn to deal with anxiety   without someone dragging you along you wouldn't go    I get very nauseous if people are yelling near me in an angry or upset way   Like my body physically can't deal with or process shouting     The first time I remember it happening was when I was playing soccer as a kid and a coach started yelling at the referee   I ran off the field because I thought I was going to vomit  Haha start small   r bodyweightfitness   you can start exercising 5 minutes a day on the floor   Start with hollow holds and planks   Anytime  And that sucks    I don't use my snap chat  but I do know that the pictures or whatever gets sent disappears after a little while  but is there any way at all possible to somehow retrieve them or no   The biggest thing I did for my anxiety was learn how to control my emotions    Part of my problem was an illness that resulted in low Testosterone which had me crying for a year and a half   After figuring that out I realized its possible to control which helped me try out different things   Yes  If you don't do it you will have to live with thinking about what might happen  That could build and build into more fantasies and dreams every time you think about her   If you ask her out and are turned down at least you can start moving on to better or different opportunities faster  Oh my god  this happens to me also  I don't have a solution per se  but I just wanted to say that you are not alone  Something that somewhat helps for me is channeling my emotions into an activity  Personally  I pick up a guitar and start to play chords and just mess around  as I find it helps to put my mind on something else  I'm  far  from good  but just playing puts me in a better mindset  as I feel I have control over something for a moment   On thank god this happens to someone else  I thought I was crazy   I also support this 100   It took me years and years of going to see my psychiatrist  but I am finally learning how to cope with my own abuse  It never hurts to talk to someone     Repeating things to myself does not help   It does help   You don't have an inner core   all of the thoughts are under your control   The problem is figuring out how to do it and sticking with it   It took me a year of smiling at myself in the mirror and saying I love you to see positive changes   For example one problem I had was seeing a knife and imagining myself killing people around me   It was exactly like a fear of heights to me   I was afraid it would just happen like falling does   After the 'I love you's to myself these just melted away   I stopped being scared by the thoughts and they stopped occurring   Yes I have it often when I am anxious  It is really my first indicator   It sucks but it does help  it enables me to enter a sort of "I don't give a fuck" mode that provides a well needed relief  Often when I drink I think to myself "this is how 'normal' people usually are  huh  pretty neat" I'm glad your friend is doing well    Consider telling your psychiatrist exactly what you wrote in your original post  You expressed yourself very well and provided important information that can help him help you  Don't know whether or not its normal  but I experience the same sort of automatic response when someone shows interest in me sexually  was sexually abused growing up for years   Through talk therapy and dbt and cbt therapies  this happens less often  And when it does happen  I can sometimes work through it  Its not full proof  but is much easier and im headed in a good direction  I would recommend those therapies  could help you as well  I wish you luck  Absolutely  Hi friend  I am incredibly sorry with hearing your story  That's heart breaking especially for your son to have gone through such a tramatic event  And to be pushed away by your family is sickening   I want to say  as a veteran  I think having both versions of PTSD together is healthy  I say this mainly not to overshadow your experience  but I think mental health in the health system lacks big time for sufferers like yourself  My wife experienced accute PTSD after seeing a man die  whom I tried to save from a heart attack   He subsequently died of his illness but she has had major anxiety since   I think your PTSD is something much more severe and in need of special care then myself as someone who seen people killed  You deserve the best care and support    Thank you for sharing your story and I think all of us who suffer drama should stand for better care across the board  Try  listening to guided meditation  they have some specifically for falling asleep  Ideas      Earplugs  I have some earplugs that I got at a grocery store that are less noise canceling than others  It kinda just turns the volume down  I can still hear but it's not as loud  I wear them to sleep  still hear my alarm  or to the gym for fitness classes with loud music      Solo movie dates  It's hard to know how to manage situations when you have the added social pressure of being around other people  Maybe if there's a  1 theater in your area  you could try out going to a movie on your own   I actually really like doing this    Maybe large headphones so people don't talk to you would be an easier idea  I think the sweatshirt tent may attract more attention than hide you  With headphones it you would blend in more and people would just assume you are trying to enjoy your tunes and leave you alone  I can't help but tune into the yelling  It's all I've known for a long time  I'm happy my parents are older and more docile now  we feel more like a family  hopefully that's all the therapy I need  I actually brought my headphones with me and had music playing on my phone for emergencies  And I was alone    thank you for the suggestions  I experience this as feeling like the person I'm speaking to  and it's usually when I'm talking to someone else  starts to shrink or feel further and further away   Quality contribution  thanks I LOVE seltzer water with frozen berries  It takes a while to get used to the lack of sugar if you're really addicted to it  I also do low carb so it's not an issue for me  but it's actually so refreshing and completely curbs my craving for a soda   But was the Chinese food good  Now I want some  I think I have the fixings for fried rice now that I think of it  Maybe later this week I will go get some Mongolian beef  Or are these so called "microsaccades"  also same  YAYS    That's great  Where did you go to  Did you enjoy yourself   I don't always enjoy myself when I go out but getting there and am able to do so now more and more  it's awesome      I don't see anything you did as wrong in the least bit  and I definitely do not think you are a bad person because of this at all   What you are describing does not strike me as bad in the least bit   Try your best not to ruminate  believe me I know how difficult it can be   We can both do this    it worked for me This happens to me when I'm extremely anxious People can't be that stupid to think that when you're on the verge of bawling your eyes out  you're in a fury of rage  In other words  they're poking fun at you  insisting you're angry  are they you  How do they know what you feel    invalidating you and your experiences  provoking you  and they're not the kind of people who want to talk  with  you   There's an acronym for this  JADE  Justify  Argue  Defend  Explain  Don't do it  Don't JADE yourself to with people like this  Instead  greyrock them and talk through this with someone who actually cares    When talking to someone who actually cares  just be honest  They'd be smart enough to understand  This absolutely makes sense to me  and I felt the same way all day night yesterday  I never remember feeling this way before when I was younger and would spend New Years with my parents and little brother  but now that I'm older and of drinking age I feel like there's so much pressure to be out with friends and drinking and having fun    but that's just not me  I'm thankful my boyfriend is the same way    It kinda reminds me of the How I Met Your Mother episode about New Years and how overrated and exhausting it is trying to have the  best New Years ever  and it just ends up being a huge  exhaustive failure    Don't worry about what other people are doing and posting  you are not them and you shouldn't compare yourself to others    remember  everything looks perfect from the outside looking in  but that is rarely ever the case   Yeah  you summed it up perfectly  I avoid parties because I just  can't  enjoy myself  When I do try and socialize  it is just so forced and awkward and I cringe when I look back at the times when I wanted to appear like an extrovert  I'm sad when I look at pictures of a party that I missed  but I also get disheartened when I'm at a party in which I feel out of place  It's a vicious cycle   Tell us more    Wow what a bunch of dickheads  This happens to me too  I was also sexually abused early in life and was raped repeatedly by my first long term boyfriend  which I thought was normal because my mom told me that it was all I was good for  That relationship ended about 4 years ago and yep I still feel this  I'm in therapy and it has really helped  but on bad days I still catch myself thinking these things    It's not just you and therapy helps  As long as you have a good therapist  of course  No    Thanks  I think the holiday season and not having much to do has exacerbated the frequency of my panic attacks  I'm going to look into new hobbies though  similar to how you keep yourself busy with competitive gaming    Regarding other people    I just don't get it when everyone is so calm about death  It makes me want to violently shake them out of it    Sometimes at night I lie under the covers and try to imagine what death feels while being absolutely still  It's terrifying but I can't stop this form of self inflicted torture     draws back to my morbid curiosity of death  while still being paralysed by the fear of it   yes  yes  yes it gets better   when it is becoming too much  that is exactly when you have to deal with it   if the idea of directly addressing your memories is overwhelming to you  there are therapy options that focus on building coping skills without having to verbally re live your specific traumas   i thought that my world would be full of triggers forever  but it is not   time help heals   the fact that you are aware of patterns in your mood and options for addressing them means you have made substantial progress already toward recovery   don't turn back  it gets brighter just around the bend   godspeed to you  happy new year  Thanks for your reply  I wrote the post last night during one of my attacks and was really comforted this morning to read the responses  I hope that one day I'll magically grow to accept it  but the more I love life  the more terrified I am of losing it    A couple months ago while overseas I visited a graveyard in a historical site and it really hit me hard  Seeing those tombstones dated hundreds of years ago  people buried in family plots  neglected graves  It just made me feel really empty    It wouldn't be so bad if we knew for sure that there was something after life  I'm just scared that my whole life means nothing in the grand scheme of things    I'm jealous that life will carry on without me  and that I'll miss out on amazing new inventions and experiences   definitely consider getting back on meds and seeing a therapist   totally worth it   its like asking if it's worth using crutches while you have a broken leg  or asking if its worth it to have insulin as a diabetic    part of PTSD can be paranoia of others and fear of being vulnerable   this is especially true if someone has taken advantage of you   part of the healing process is being able to open up to healthy people and build new trust and connections   one of the best ways to prevent PTSD is to give people community and support after trauma   it also has the potential to rebuild your confidence and mental health moving forward  100  can relate  I was once fired for crying uncontrollably after a jerkhole boss berated me for asking for help on a task at work I was being trained on  I try to accept as part of me and work with it  Don't shut down  at least for me  that can worsen the panic attacks  Ask for help  and if the first person you ask doesn't help you keep at it  I also try engaging all my five senses and reminding myself I'm safe   You are not alone  you are not damaged goods  you have many good qualities and your illness does not define you  You are worthy and you are loved  What medication are you taking     Thank you very much for your response  it is very helpful and sounds about right  But unfortunately  whilst she had a therapist counsellor in the past  she felt uncomfortable talking about this incident  and as such  didn't discuss what happened at all  I have advised her a few times to try speaking to someone  even just her doctor  when she feels able to  not being pushy or too frequent  just suggesting it here and there  even before she told me about this incident   but she continues to feel uncomfortable doing so   Of course I don't know exactly what goes on in her mind  but she's generally quite a quiet person  and tends to internalise or ignore a lot of her feelings instead of dealing with them in a more active manner  She also recently applied for a job in the military and is afraid that being diagnosed with depression or PTSD means she will be exempt from this career path  Well  there's only one way to find out  which is to get that blood test  And if you do indeed have diabetes  you'll be much better off if you get on a treatment plan rather than remaining undiagnosed  I know it sucks and is nerve wracking  but plenty of people have diabetes and live a perfectly normal life  Also maybe you'll get lucky and it is just your anxiety after all   I appreciate your response  and as much as I like to be open minded about different techniques  I fail to grasp this particular method  feel skeptical of it for myself  and am unsure about how to use it successfully  I also found the linked content unhelpful  Any advice  CT   Thank you so much for this thoughtful  sincere response  It's especially helpful to hear it from a therapist  and especially given the kind of work that you do with trauma survivors  My current therapist also is very well versed in trauma  and has done speeches on his hypnosis work with trauma survivors  and it has always been reassuring to see his depth of knowledge and sensitivity within that discourse  for my care's sake  Is it possible for me to stay in touch with you some how in case I have similar questions or have these spontaneous self doubt melt downs  My therapist is on vacation for the holidays        Thanks again  Sertraline 100mg Visited Grandma and went to a new park by her place  It was a nice outing  I'll speak from my experience  I was depressed and rather numb as well when I sought help  Therapy helped  significantly  although my therapist eventually determined he could not do any more for me and referred me to a psychiatrist  Therapy did not change my subconscious  it helped me manage my thoughts and develop behavioral strategies  My therapist and I talked in detail about irrational thoughts  why I have them  and how to challenge them  I think it's also important that therapy didn't end with the office visits  it was something I had and have to apply daily  It can be a lot of work sometimes    On the relationship front  my therapist helped me to keep perspective on what my family was observing in me  I resented their comments and reactions a lot less  and this helped me not to give spiteful responses  It also helped me work through my resentment towards friends for daring to ask me to go out and do something  I am calmer in knowing it's okay to say no sometimes and I can think more rationally about accepting invitations and pushing myself  I stuck with the therapist I initially saw  so I can't really help on finding the right one  I just liked him and his manner    Therapy is expensive  I can't deny that  I'm in the US with high deductible health insurance  using a health savings account helps  How I viewed it was I was paying for more than just the hour  but all the time I was using what I'd learned    Good luck  you can figure this out  Hmm i take 50mg and ive missed doses before  didnt notice any side effects tho   But maybe wait for more responses as your dose is higher than mine    Cant you call ur doc   Thank you for your comment  The service I accessed in the past was just intended for use up to 12 months after an incident  and whilst I have been trying to access therapy for various reasons through the NHS for over the last year  it still seems elusive  hidden behind constant waiting lists and referrals  And unfortunately I don't have the money to afford a private therapist for now  This particular aspect of my situation is killing me   I really appreciate and agree with what you are saying though  particularly that whilst I am like this  it is hard to create a safe  strong  supporting environment for us both  That said  I feel that when she has issues she wishes to discuss with me  my head seems to clear suddenly and everything else fades away  like I go into protective mode and my tunnel vision towards helping her swings into action  Therefore  I think I have a fairly good success rate for helping her when she is upset and needs help  it's just everything around these occasions that is worse right now    Thank you very much  Maybe acceptance is the step to a better fortune  You have to be really careful with edibles  I've had great success with them  but have also wrecked myself  It was actually a huge contributing factor to my POCD breakdown  I would imagine it is largely strain dependent  I CAN'T do sativas  The deep thinking makes my OCD go out of control and that was with a hybrid  I don't want to know what a full sativa would do  I've had pretty good luck with indicas although once I was in an OCD breakdown they made it worse as well   All that to say  be really careful with any drugs if you have OCD   Very well said   I've heard Cymbalta  Duloxetine  is helpful at higher doses  I think what we're seeing here is there are many options that may work best for you  Try not to get frustrated and keep working toward better days  Type 2 diabetes can be effectively eliminated reversed at your age just by losing the weight and eating appropriately  It's not too late to change your life  regardless of how your results come back  I have heard that it is extremely difficult to get a job at Costco outside of hiring events when they open new stores   Even then they are very selective about who they hire   People seem to stay at Costco forever   There are multiple people who have worked at the Costco near me since the store opened    in 1989   Others have been there 5  10 or 15 years   That is unheard of in retail in my view  You're very welcome   You can reach me here  in PM if you want   I typically check in at least daily  though it may be every other day when things are busy for me   If you don't hear back from me quickly  it's not that I'm ignoring you  I'm just not on  You my be able to access services through the RAINN website if you live in the states  They have a 1 800 number  a online forum and can refer you to a trauma therapist in your community whose services are free   I hope that you and your gf find the support that you both need  They are jerks  I've noticed that most the time time when anxiety is triggered it because people are being jerks  I just ignore them Fuck those people  OP  If they'll yell at a new person for breaking an unwritten and uncommunicated rule  they aren't worth the effort  Please make sure you DO NOT turn to drugs to deal with this    It gets better  I promise  Don't let meth ruin your life like it has mine    Good luck my friend    Love u and happy new year Green tea definitely has caffeine  but much less than regular coffee   The  abbreviated  hierarchy of most to least caffeine is  coffee  black tea  green tea  decaf coffee  Hey  for a moment i tought you were my gf  cause i know thats how she exactly feels about my anxiety relationship    Just be there for him  dont try to do anything  Everytime i get panic attacks and my gf starts asking are u okay u want some water u want to go outside or starts holding my hand  it just makes it worse for me    The reason for this is because it makes me more nervous and anxious  While im trying to fight my racing thoughts and convincing my brain that nothing is happening  i just really need silence    I sometimes feel like a dick because i always throw her off and she gets mad and then i feel like shit  but deep down i know shes just trying to help me cause she worries about me    I already talked to her and told her that i really appreciate her help but the best thing she can do for me while me having anxiety attack is to just be there and pretend nothing is happening  dont stare at me like im having a stroke  if ineed help or feel that its getting out of hand ill tell her   I suppose I have something on the flipside  so to speak   I have PTSD in part from severe emotional abuse from three different exes  in the same manner   It makes me basically incapable of feeling loved or wanted or attractive  Likewise  whenever I see or interact with a girl I find attractive  I get an awful  sick feeling in my stomach   I dunno   it's just like I feel so repulsive because of how callously I've been treated in the last  When I was about your age I was thinking the same thing     I had my first kiss at 21   I went on my first date when I was 27   Every date I've had since then has been increasingly easier     I've still yet to have a relationship but I know it's going to happen   I just keep trying   My brother once told me it's just a numbers game     I understand the comfort of acceptance  but I don't recommend it  I have not attempted a GED  but I know of some people that have  They all passed and from what I remember them saying  it wasn't too bad   On the topic of your mom  that sounds like a tough situation  One thing I have had to grasp about my own family is that everyone is doing the best they can within their own frame of mind   It sounds like your mom is HUGE on maintaining appearances  Probably because she was raised in the same way from her own family so she doesn't really know any other way to live  Society also preaches about maintaining appearances too   On the other hand  you have suffered a lot over the years and you know that maintaining appearances is not important to you  You need to figure out what is though   For me  I like making people laugh  I have connected with a smallish sized online community on twitter with other like minded people that like to do comedy  I'm in chat rooms with them and feel welcome in most of em  They help me to feel connected   You need to learn more about who you are and what you like  Also  don't be afraid to push through some of the fear  Like taking baby steps outside to help push against the agoraphobia   Keep reading about the condition online and learn from those that have succeeded in achieving independent living with agoraphobia   Take all my advice with a grain of salt  Also  talk to a school counselor too at your local community college  The are pretty cheap and help others even if you don't go to school there  This would be my choice of life if I didn't feel empty and thinking about the fun I used to have  I think people need friends Absolutely   And regardless of the outcome take pride in yourself for having the courage to do it and the maturity to accept the answer if you're rejected   Much better to be straightforward than to covertly try to be her friend and months later spring it on her that you never wanted to just be her friend to begin with     Or better yet  go ask out a bunch of random girls first   You'll likely get turned down a lot   But you'll get some practice in and will learn to deal with rejection   So when it comes time to ask out a girl you really do like you'll be more confident   And nothing is more attractive than confidence  You need to do this with a plan from your doctor   If you were feeling worse with the medication  they could try another   I'm tapering off 20mg of lexapro right now as well  I didn't like the lethargy and other side effects  and my dr made a plan of 20mg every day and 10mg every third day  for a month   Next month  20 mg one day 10 mg the next  for a month   Then 10 mg every day for a month   You can't just make up your own program that lasts three days or you'll have these withdrawal effects   You are welcome    Yes I work with people to help them overcome social anxiety  I wasn't saying that you did expect them to magically disappear  I was simply saying that that is going to happen just because 1 day turns in to another  and that these things take work    I understand the symbolism of the new year  and I'm sure you won't be alone in your thinking  But you still have 363 days left in 2017 to make progress    I actually only found I got use from counselling for the day I had the counselling  there are 7 days in a week and I was only feeling better for 1 of them  Also in the end we ended up just going round in circles  Have you heard of considered CBT DBT   I know a lot of people who learn some great chomping methods through that   Yay  That's fantastic  You should be proud  the stuff that feels impossible can be so worthwhile  I hope that is not the case  I was recently in a similar situation  But  on the bright side  a shelter may be able to refer you to resources to help with mental health  You ARE going to be ok  Hang in there  I used to be fine with angry people  but now I'm customer service damaged and either panic or completely shut down  I don't understand why adults think that throwing tantrums is acceptable  Wow    you sound exactly like my boyfriend  Thank you for the advice    it can be so hard to get in someone's head who has anxiety when you don't have it yourself  I promise your girlfriend  and me  just want to make our boyfriends feel better  I've experienced this in different situations  My body is there but my mind is somewhere completely different  like somebody said  this happens when I'm really anxious about something and then it leads me to zone out of things and generally become completely unaware of my surroundings  After a long talk and explaining to my S O what specifically went down last night  I feel like we are on the same page and she apologized for her comments        After going through  the sources you all provided  mulling them over  cleaning and re cleaning the same things over and over and just giving time for everything to settle and process  I still feel pissed but knowing that there is a support group for this  someone to hear this out and give feedback on where to turn is just relieving  You have no idea how wonderful you all are  Thank you very much  It's weird for me to sit and stew on a certain thing and not just move on  I think I may be able to with the help that was provided  General Tso's is another favorite of mine  Esp when they don't make it too sweet   I saw a bird I have not seen before  a Townsend Warbler  I really want to go back and see what other birds I can find down by the river that I don't normally see  I completely understand how you feel  I've been suffering from anxiety panic for 5 years now and I get palpitations and my heart races  sometimes feels like my heart is just going to stop and I will die  I felt better once I found this thread  Thank you  but unfortunately I live in the UK  and any similar services don't seem to be as widespread or particularly useful  and are particularly few and far between for male support  I haven't found anything helpful online thus far  But thank you for the recommendation  and your support  It is truly appreciated  I tried a new medication  even though I very much did not want to  I then either got sick or had a bad reaction to the medication  I'm emetophobic  so that's just loads of fun   I would usually spend all of my time pacing outside because it soothes me and because I have a superstition that I won't vomit if I'm outdoors   Instead  I have mostly stayed in bed and tried to take care of myself  Often those who do not respond to an SSRI at a low dose do not see improvement with a higher dose  That being said  theoretically  a dose change from 20mg to 30mg is safe  This is not medical advice to change your dose without your doctor's permission  You may want to see your doctor regarding a change in medication  If you call in you may be able to see your doctor sooner   Medications in the same family as paxil  escitalopram lexapro and sertraline zoloft have been proven to be more safe and more efficacious for the treatment of depression and anxiety  Cipriani  2009   Yup worst case you can take meds and lose weight and self manage  Lots of people live that way  Tapering is done over weeks or months  not days  To your body  you essentially quit cold turkey  No problem     It can be hard but it gets better  just remember to have some patience  4yrs with your bf its a lot time so its worth it     if your bf hasn't gotten any medical help  he should  It has helped me tremendously   Yeah  one minute I'm relaxed then I start thinking of what might happen or how my voice will sound  then I'm fully tensed up a second later and my heart starts beating profoundly  This is me when I'm put on the spot  I don't if you meant if we were to be relaxing in our home then start thinking about SA  Side effects of missing sertraline would be uncomfortable  but not life threatening  Starting back on a higher dose of sertraline once it has cleared your body will amplify all the side effects you may have had when you started it    namely lightheadedness  again  uncomfortable but not necessarily life threatening  This of course is not medical advice  and your doctor will probably have someone covering for them while they are on vacation  2 thoughts      1  Why dismiss drugs AND therapy    2  I suppose it would depend on the tic There might be side effects to increasing the dose  which might in turn not make anything much better  You should really talk to your Doctor beforehand unless it was discussed earlier  Being happier and making people around me happy I have a correlation between my anxiety and temperature  the cold causes anxiety and when I'm anxious I get cold  The cold always feels like it's radiating from inside of me though  and it causes my rib cage to vibrate  and if it goes on long enough my teeth and hands will start chattering and shaking   I think it's best to  instead of trying to learn how to handle each individual side effect that your anxiety causes and feeling overwhelmed that there's just so many symptoms to deal with  first off just try and focus on calming your mind and putting yourself into calm environments  Then it would probably be a good idea to start getting down to the root of the issue  talk to a psychiatrist or someone to work on how to combat your anxiety rather than your anxiety's symptoms  I'm sort of open minded about drugs  hard to explain  but therapy would be completely humiliating   Facial motor tics mainly  this is like an exact mirror image of me  the reason why i got on reddit today was to make a post about it to clear my head and get some advice  i don't know how to stop fixating on these things  the physical manifestations seem so real and god forbid i get sick or have a headache it's just downhill from their  i know this isn't advice  but it helps me to know that i'm not the only one going through this  i hope it helps you  My friend bikes  it works well for him  Augmentation is very common in the treatment of mood disorders when a patient sees a partial response to a medication like Zoloft  but still would benefit from further medical therapy  Abilify is a very common agent used for augmentation  Possibly  however only a professional can diagnose you    Since this concerns you I'd strongly suggest requesting a referral through your primary care physician   Please don't do what I did  avoided getting help until my symptoms led me to consider a life threatening action     I am living proof that things can get better   IF you ask for help   Best of luck to you  If you bring SA as an excuse then your "not wanting" is not genuine but actually a coping mechanism  Like the fox and the sour grapes  I'll throw in my two cents  I totally get why you would say you'd want to drink more  It's simple  alcohol is an effective anxiolytic drug and mood lifter   My suggestion would be to learn how to use small to moderate amounts alcohol as a tool to feel more comfortable  Try to plan a fun night doing something you enjoy that you would usually drink heavily for  but instead of doing the usual  get two beers  one at a time  and slowly sip them over a couple hours  That way you can train yourself to see the benefits of smaller doses and improved clarity  My favorite nights of drinking have all been less than 5 drinks  many of them one or two    But don't knowingly take on a crutch  especially not one so incredibly toxic  Not to be too morbid but my sister died at 27 because she got comfortable with using massive amounts of vodka day in and day out to help her cope with her anxieties and depression  There are much better suited drugs available if you do need daily assistence  Remember also that alcohol is one of the few drugs that going cold turkey on can cause death  so at the very least find a way to stop yourself from making it even a small daily habit   Edit  another drinking tip  most people think alcohol kicks in immediately or within a minute or two  The onset might happen that quickly  but the actual effects on the body and brain have a latency of 15 to 20 minutes  Binge drinking is really a risk because you can have an excessive volume of liquor  assume you're fine because you feel warm and happy 5 minutes later  then try to chase the feeling by doubling how much liquor you've drunk all before the negative effects of overdoing it with the first drink kick in  So by drinking less concentrated alcohol more slowly  you can have more fun while keeping you and everyone else around you safe Always happens to me when I have a cold  I tend to get a stomach ache and pretty often  diarrhea   especially if I've been coughing a lot or have a runny stuffy nose  Don't worry  you already know you have a cold and those symptoms don't go hand in hand  You're not sick with anything but the little cold  Don't let it worry you   Mid 20s too  I wish i could say something to make u feel better but i cant  because i feel exactly the same  I think " Unmanageable" is a word that perfectly describes my anxiety  I am in therapy but had not made any progress about this issue so im really considering medication  I can only tell you that i understand u and i really wish one day we all can overcome this  yes definitely  I feel like I'm watching myself in a movie or something    Well  don't let your mind race too far ahead  Deal with one thing at a time  Maybe you don't have it  And if you do  yes it might suck  but you'll figure out how to be fine  I bet your parents will be sympathetic and understanding rather than blaming you   Yep same here   I'm the same when someone is yelling angrily  I hate angry tones  It's upsets my anxiety and my heart starts racing   Hopefully telling your doctor about it will be a huge relief and he can help you deal with it  That's awesome and brave and so hard to do  but it'll be worth it I'm the same way  but I just kinda shut down and have a full blown episode  Married  and I left the abuse 4 years ago  My husband understands  but he does have a quick temper so this happens nearly daily      This sounds fine to me I doubt your friend even noticed honestly  It sucks  but finding the right med is all about trial and error  as everyone responds differently  You have to try the new med  wait a few weeks and see if it works  then get off that  possibly withdraw and try a new med for a few weeks  It's very time consuming and frustrating if you're not feeling any better  So at least you get some relief with the benzos   I hope you find something long term soon  I am the same way because of my childhood too  I avoid doing anything to make people angry is mostly means I just avoid them lol   Oh I'm sorry to hear that  Have you seen a doctor counsellor at all  Do you can you speak about it with your friends   family  I feel the same  I don't think I'm ever gonna change tbh  I have been dealing with severe health anxiety since around the age of 12  currently 23y   It comes and goes in waves  and as of now I'm experiencing it rather severely  For me  therapy has been vital  I have an appointment with a new therapist in two weeks  and I've been waiting to go for over a month  It's been getting to the point where I've been unsure if I can make it that long   Coping wise  stay off google  Try your best to not focus in on every little twinge and pain  This has been difficult for me  I need to take my own advice  Find a therapist  if you have health insurance see what that will cover  If you are in university  most colleges offer counseling for very little if not completely free  It's a bit more complicated than your understanding  but yes  you can  effectively  reverse diabetes if you lose the weight and be healthy  That doesn't mean that it won't always be something to monitor  but you'll be a far cry from losing limbs and whatnot   You're young  you still have a chance  However the longer you let this go on  the smaller that chance becomes  If you're terrified now just to see a doctor  use that energy to invest in yourself    Glad to hear that  It just aggravated the fuck out of my insomnia   Same here  sadly  Meds have helped with it a bit though   don't get teary eyed from emotional reaction to anger insults I've had both drugs and therapy  It's not humiliating to have therapy  You do want to find a therapist you click with  which won't necessarily be the first one you try    So  what I was thinking when I asked on the kind of tic was kind of this  that some things   like the one where people swear compulsively   would be more clearly unacceptable  whereas  for some things  I wonder if you might    decide not to mind them  My sister has this thing where she is an incredibly picky eater  and she would find it hard to go out to eat with friends because what if they didn't have anything she liked to eat  or what if they thought it was weird that she would only eat certain stuff  Eventually I said to her  look  if you don't want to change it  then why don't you just own it  Be like  this is how I am  and that's ok  And just expect other people to be ok with it too  Another one is this girl I know who has a compulsive sneeze  She was a grad student and sometimes in the middle of someone else's special talk she'd just start sneezing these incredibly loud sneezes  a whole bunch in a row  which  as you can imagine  is a lot more disruptive than a facial tic would be   After I met her  I discovered that she didn't even seem to be self conscious about it   was just very matter of fact that she had this thing and couldn't help it   and after that I just accepted it  She was very sweet and winsome and I came to like her so much    But yeah  I mean  it's either change or accept it  as far as I can think  and drugs and therapy would be the ways to change it  Wish I could tell you to find a blue pebble under a harvest moon  boil it in catnip tea  coat it in chocolate and swallow  but    Honestly I'm a mess  I can't take my mind of any of my worries or concerns for even a minute  If I try to distract myself the thoughts come back no matter what  I'm miserable  I'm constantly afraid something extreme is about to happen to me medically  I'm terrified I'll have an anaphylactic reaction to any food so it's also impacting how I eat  I have break downs in public places  If I'm alone  forget about it  I've been trying to schedule an appointment with a therapist for months  and have one now in two weeks  I'm not even sure if I can make it that long  I wake up in the middle of the night with my heart racing  I have almost constant chest cramps and pain  radiating around my rib cage  My jaw hurts and I keep pushing my tongue hard against my teeth so it's creating these ridges in my tongue  but I've convinced myself it's because my tongue is swollen and my throat is about to close  My anxiety isn't limited to health but it's heavily dominating it right now   It's impacting my ability to function and work  relationships with friends and family  my relationship with my boyfriend  I'm so miserable  I know I'll be ok  But right now it feels like I'll never be   Thank you for listening  I am the opposite  whenever their is conflict I get amped up and ready to go  I guess 18 years of ice hockey will do that to you  P You are not alone  So many people have fears of doctors  I myself used to be terrified of doctors  But now I have great relationships with all my doctors  The fact of the matter is that   avoidance   is actually your worst enemy  The more you avoid the doctor  the scarier they become in your mind    What you need to know is this  Doctors don't give you disease  they give you remedies for the conditions that you are already suffering through  You are already doing the hard part  which is dealing with pain and suffering of anxiety    When you go to the doctor  they just tell you what the problem is and offer you options  I always like to stress the word   options   because doctors don't make you do anything  They just offer you solutions and let you decide    If I were you  I would make an appointment with your GP and tell them that you are experiencing some physical issues but that you think it may be related to hypochondria  You just want to come in and get their opinion    This is great because it tells your doctor that you would like to help deal with anxiety on top of your physical issues  They will be able to offer you solutions for your anxiety that may help to reduce all of your physical symptoms      Don't be afraid of therapy  I'm in my early 20s  23  and about to go back  I've had anxiety my entire life and it helped so much  Make an appointment and get out of your comfort zone  Welcome to 2017  First  I would be PISSED that your bf and co driver didn't tell you this beforehand  Not even on an emetophobic level here  it's just plain decency   Second  did you put your hands in your mouth at any point before you got to wash your hands  If not  try and relax  I'm trying to think of what I would tell myself if I were in your shoes  Well  I'd wash my shoes  haha  sorry   Here's the thing  It may not have necessarily been contagious  Mexico has some   funky water in some places  And food  Food poisoning is a huge possibility  The only way things like that are cought "through the air" is when vomiting or diarrhea happens and the particles come up in the air  and are breathed in and swallowed  From nasal passage to throat  until they settle to the ground again  I hate to put this image in your head but just for reference  think of dropping a water balloon and the way the water will splash up then settle down  Kinda like that  You were not a part of that   Honestly  going through the rational part of my own mind  I'm thinking if you didn't lick your shoes  your hands or put your face near anything there  you should be alright  Clean up your car the best you can  dilute a fresh bottle of bleach in some water and wipe down what you touched in your car    Keep me updated here  I have no school for a couple days  I should be around     Take it easy   I feel this way too  and sometimes it's better to focus on yourself and your future  but not to live by the future  Maybe plan for happier and better things  and live happily     Yes  The best way to describe it is it's like being high on marijuana  without the psychoactive aspect  if that makes any sense  Wow  Spot on  Thanks for the share   I have this  I have this horribly bad  It's kind of like a form of PTSD  a mild one though  You have a traumatic experience  Whatever is traumatizing to you   you have a deja vu like feeling where your body physically or mentally feels sensations before that lead to something bad happening  your brain will associate it with that almost every time  You say you almost get flashbacks  I definitely have those flashbacks  They send me into a spiral of anxiety every time    The only thing that has worked for me  May not work for all  is distractions  I mean  it has to be something a little intense like a very busy video game  Lots going on   have the radio playing at the same time  You're basically trying to drown it out and have your brain associate the feeling with something other than bad vibes  Meditation  breathing exercises and yoga work for others   You may never forget past experiences  but there are ways to have a simple thought about them and be able to shrug it off  I think your first step should be to see a therapist or doctor  It's going to seem extremely daunting and intimidating but  in order for you to truly overcome this you must seek professional help  I know advice from reddit can be comforting and it's a hell of a lot easier than dealing with a doctor but  you need whats best for you    Go see a doctor  things will get better    Hi  Sorry to hear about your struggles  Would it be an option to print out or write down what you just wrote and hand it to a therapist and general physician  I understand you said that you're scared of going to the doctor  which is very common  by the way   but would it make it easier if you show them your post instead of talking directly to them  It could take a lot of pressure off of you  You expressed yourself very well and provided important information that can help them help you  Keep in mind that seeing a doctor doesn't automatically mean you'll be prescribed psychiatric medication  nothing wrong with that though  I'm on psych meds myself    It can be helpful to get a blood test ordered and a check up done though  A therapist can provide support  teach coping skills  help you move forward  help you challenge any negative thoughts  give you a private place to express yourself  and give you objective feedback on your struggles   All of this is entirely your decision  so there's no pressure coming from me  If you decide to go down this route  you may be able to schedule an appointment online with your school's mental health counseling center  if you're in the US  they may be called CAPS  which stands for Counseling and Psychological Services or something similar to that   Your school's health center should have a general physician you can meet with   Lastly  if you have any questions  like what types of questions you would be asked by a professional  how to prepare for a first appointment  how first appointments usually go  or my personal experiences with professional help   then don't hesitate to ask me  Feel free to send a message anytime   Whether I talk in front of a group of people  I feel like I am not even speaking  only listening  If it's actually a pimple  then it's not cancer  Scrotum pimples are pretty common and harmless  I hope that's all it is  So therapy is way more of an art than a science  so it's really hard to just say "Here's what is going to happen and what it'll do to you"   I had one useless therapist  one so so one  and two that I got a lot of progress with   And all four had really different methodologies   Dr Drew talks how half of therapy is just sitting down with someone  learning what it feels like to be comfortable and uncriticized  and then share your true self with them   Half of the progress you'll get is just in learning how to bond with another person   Many of us have never had this  and are stuck in a constant "If I share my true thoughts  I'll get attacked"   The huge progress I've made is when I am able to understand my underlying thought process  I E  I always had SA and felt bad talking to people or using up their time  but it wasn't until a really specific interaction that I uncovered this direct "If I make a mistake  the other person judges me badly  then they leave  then I feel unlovable and worthless"   I never could have understood that process without the help of an objective third party   In regards to crying  the first time I went in with a "I never feel emotions  I used to joke with coworkers about us being dead on the inside  no clue why I don't enjoy things or feel sad ever" and as soon as I sat down and made eye contact with him  I burst into tears   It was kind of funny looking back  but I just spent so long with no real personal contact  no one interested in me personally  no actual human interaction with depth   It was kind of shocking but made me certain that I had an actual problem that I needed to work on   The problem with your questions  is that imagine asking them about a car mechanic   If you know your car isn't working right  you find someone who is trained to help  and you pay them to help   You do want to get your money's worth  and you do want to make sure they are competent  but there's often no way to do so without trying them   It's a hard thing   I had to take on an idea of "This is a doctor  I'm just going to show up there  put myself in his hands  tell him what is wrong  and do whatever he said" and turns out therapy doesn't really work like that  but it helped   Let me know if you could use any other info encouragement  Thank you  Feels good to hear from someone similar   Yeah  I sometimes feel the same way  I don't think the veterans suffering from PTSD should have to create another subreddit   Speaking as a rape survivor  I think we all have a lot to learn from one another   Also  the group isn't really high traffic enough to necessitate splitting  Thank you  I will keep all this in mind  I'm honestly really scared for my future because I feel like I've already made up my mind to "knowingly take on a crutch " as you accurately put it  I guess because I was on SSRIs for a year  before I started drinking  and they made me feel about 60  better  and then I discovered alcohol which made me feel 100  better  to me the choice just seems obvious  maybe it's not logical  but it's just so goddamn tempting  I imagine myself this year  back on meds  feeling pretty good and a ok  and then I imagine myself carrying around a flask on me and taking a couple quick sips before social situations  and feeling fucking awesome  That second scenario sounds so much more favorable to me  I know it won't be something I'll be able to give up once I've started down that road  I know it'll probably ruin my health and could very well kill me before I hit 30  but right now  for whatever reason  it's an adventure I want to go on  I know it's not the right choice  but I've been trying to make what I thought were the right choices for most of my life  and clearly none of them have worked out in my favor because look where I am today and what I'm writing here  I just don't see the point in trying to improve anymore  because I'm pretty sure I'm just the type of person who naturally wants to self destruct  I understand that feeling  And yes  it's totally normal    It's okay to    feel okay  It's okay to feel "over it" sometimes  and at other times feel actively upset about it  And I totally empathize with that feeling of guilt during the "over it" times  It feels like such a big thing to put behind you  And especially if you weren't believed by some people  it can feel like letting them "win" by letting go when they haven't even acknowledged it      But that emotional distance is a gift  And it's absolutely normal  There are a shocking number of people in the world who have suffered from sexual assault  and most of us get through our day just fine  Many of us  you'd never even know unless the subject came up  And it's okay to become one of those people someday  too   It's all about meeting people in locations you like to visit  Maybe you like playing guitar  go to a music shop nearby or a music club and start meeting people with similar interest  Or if you really like your online friends make plans on visiting each other one day  I get these symptoms for anxiety too  I've had anxiety my whole life though  I think panic attacks can be random even if you havent had anxiety in the past  How hard fast is your heart pounding  if it doesnt go away for a while just visit a doctor  you'll be fine tho I dont know of any way  But  breathing deeply is good as it can help lessen physical anxiety symptoms  To do so consciously can help you mentally as well  as a sort of meditation  Try counting the breaths too  Or imagine doing something mindlessly repetitive to the breaths  like crocheting  Focusing on overall stress instead of one particular instance sounds like a good idea  The problem is that she's a grad student so the stress and work never really goes away  Still  I think you have a good point about doing what I can to at least keep things clean around the house and help encourage exercise   two things I'm not very good at at the moment   Oh  Regular alk therapy might help then   I mean in the immediate future  I just worry about this a lot  Pure O stands for pure obsession  If there is a compulsion  internally or otherwise  involved with obsessive thoughts  it is OCD  Pure O describes just obsessive and intrusive thoughts that cause distress but not the need to complete compulsions to eliminate that stress  I'm currently in the same situation but with a popular outgoing girl  I guess we just gotta build up our courage and also accept the fact that we might get rejected  I send you the best of luck  Hopefully she says yes if you do ask her  I know this was of no help at all but atleast we're in for a treat if we do ask out our crush  Best of luck once again  She has been seeing a therapist for a few months  I wouldn't say that she's not anxious in other parts of her life   she's high functioning and always fulfills her responsibilities  but it can take a big toll on her and sometimes she shuts down or needs a lot of coaxing and encouragement to get through a simple task like resetting a password to an account or calling her parents  I honestly have no idea if she's even considered medication   I'll float the idea of going with her to a therapy appointment  thanks  My goals I made with my therapist are to make it 2 weeks at a job  make it six months at a job  and join a club in my area to meet people   I'm sorry to hear about your struggles  That's a huge success though    if you have any questions  like what types of questions you would be asked by a professional  how to prepare for a first appointment  how first appointments usually go  or my personal experiences with professional help   then don't hesitate to ask me  Feel free to send a message anytime   Have you tried therapy  I've had severe health anxiety my entire life and therapy is where I receive help that lasts for years  I'm about to go back because it's becoming sever again  I should have actually gone back years ago  Hi  I'm sorry to hear about your struggles  Making the decision to see the doctor is a huge success though  I hope you can benefit from help as much as I  and many others I personally know  have benefited from it   I just wanted to let you know that if you have any questions  like what types of questions you would be asked by a professional  how to prepare for a first appointment  how first appointments usually go  or my personal experiences with professional help   then don't hesitate to ask me  Feel free to send a message anytime   That's what I was thinking  It was just one of those weird thoughts that pops up into your mind  I doubt they even gave it a second thought but I've been anxious about it for days Currently in therapy  Still in the beginning of it all  Not sure what I should address in this type of situation with my therapist  Is there any sort of thing I should inquire about   What    This sounds so weird   If you change your lifestyle now it's completely reversible  Watch forks over knives  Do some research  Type 2 is usually hereditary and life style related  Many people can manage without insulin and a lot of illnesses can be prevented by taking care of yourself   i have felt exactly this  you describe it so well   one thing that helps me is to distinguish between sound sensitivity and the social anxiety associated with someone possibly being angry with you   sound sensitivity is that immediate pang of stress   it's pretty easy to self soothe it away once the stimulus is over   and during self soothing  i find i've also delayed the social anxiety and that feels like a big step in overcoming it too  I'm trying to get through a panic attack right now   I used to use Xanax for anxiety  but ended up getting addicted to it  Twice  So they won't prescribe me anymore  but I detoxed from it   My psychiatrist prescribed me Ativan instead  but I really try to get through the attacks on my own and will only use Ativan when I really really need it  when I start getting nauseous  light headed  cold sweats  etc    I guess my biggest victory recently is getting through and passing my public speaking class  My professor was incredibly encouraging and really believed in me  I did 6 speeches  one of which I gave a medical demonstration of a subcutaneous injection for the class     So I should definitely be proud of myself  I cry at nearly anything these days  The slightest tone of disappointment or disapproval puts me on a new level though  I understand how you feel   Mention how the thoughts are obsessive to you  A lot of phobias fears associated with anxiety can become OCD in nature  so treating the obsession and any compulsive behaviors you might have when you have those thoughts can be helpful to you  Also  as a mother I would bring up concerns you ay have with parenting and your fear obsession being picked up by your daughter  as that seems to be a concern of yours as well  Also  I would keep a journal where you write your concerns for your therapist  This is something I try to do  For example  a thought that does sit right  or a moment where maybe you tried a coping mechanism and it didn't work  bringing up these concerns to your therapist will help with the smaller  day to day anxiety you may not be picking up on as much  Thank you  I appreciate it  Who told you not to use the bathroom  Why did they say that   The brain is powerful  Anxiety is conniving  It sneaks lies in and our brains often believe those lies  It's well known that anxiety can cause physical symptoms  If you question your thoughts you'll often find your anxieties to be irrational and illogical  No shame in that  I've fallen down that trap myself  I was so crippled with guilt that i thought the only way i could escape it was suicide  I was so anxious and I would just keep confessing but everytime the guilt just kept on coming back  One morning it was just so bad i just looked up obsessive guilt on youtube  this was before i even knew what OCD was  and found this video   https   www youtube com watch v vjRjaTA2bD8  Completely changed everything  I occasionally get guilty but i am much better at identifying obsessive thoughts  I'm facing a similar situation  Your post has helped to calm my nerves  Than you   I know how you feel and I'm sorry you have to go through that  What usually help me calm down is one thing my therapist taught me to do where you essentially just keep asking yourself "and then hat " Until you realize that the worst case scenario of what you're afraid of isn't a bad a you thought it would be  For example  you are probably thinking to yourself "I'm going to contract ring worm " Then ask yourself  "and then what " "I go to the doctor and get medication " "And then what " "I get better "  I'm sure it's going to be more complicated than that in your mind but I just wanted to illustrate it for you   I hope this helps you   The worst it ever got for me was when I was suffering with POCD  I felt so physically ill that I basically just slept for 3 days pretending to be sick so I wouldn't have to tell anyone what I was feeling  I eventually "confessed"the things that my mind made up about me and that helped me get better for awhile even though it I technically a compulsion   I usually get concerned and think for hours if it was my fault or theirs  and how much fault we share  and i weight various different possibilities  then i'll either forget about it or i'll do something stupid to defend myself because I think the person has made a permanent decision to hate me  Very problematic depending on the relationship type  the more affect they can have on my life  the more defensive I get    I think  hmmm   i have a problem   but not really  cunt's shouldnt be talkin shit if they dont want to deal with the wrath  i come on so strong and fast I scare myself  but it's all logical when you consider the 30 different factors  which no one ever does but me    Perhaps because they care  Perhaps because it makes them feel better about themselves  and means they can ignore your problems needs  Hard to guess without context   This is what I immediately thought of reading your post    https   m youtube com watch v zCqA5Ua3OVA   it just sounds to me like you are no longer as scared of these thoughts as you used to be  Don't worry  I am positive you have no desire to act on them  Sorry this is so late  and I apologize but I don't have any advice to give you just yet  but I can relate   I am 24 and was abused by my older brother when i was 8 9ish  memory is still a little fuzzy    I didn't remember my abuse until recently  but I have been living with my brother for the past 2 years since I moved back home after college and it has been an absolute mess   It's at a point where we basically don't ever talk because when we do  he becomes incredibly cruel   I've been making efforts to move out this summer now that I finally have a real job and will be done with my Master's degree by then  but I've spent plenty of nights crying because I'm beginning to realize that I probably won't have any relationship with my brother once I do   It makes me sad to think that once my parents are gone  he's the only family I'll have left  but he can't stand the sight of me   I guess my face has just become a constant reminder of what he did and he can't handle the guilt   I've spoken to my parents about it and we are discussing the potential of confronting him about it  but I doubt it will make a difference   If anything changes and we somehow work it out  I'll be sure to send a happier update your way   I truly hope things work out for you  I thought i had it rough getting choked out by someone i let in my apartment    Stay strong  Are we twins   I also have to keep constantly reminding myself that people's emotional states are nothing to do with me  but it can be very hard  especially when your jerkbrain is telling you that all your friends hate you   I have nothing to offer except the knowledge that you aren't alone  At times  immediately after sex I want to cry  I feel sick   We've been married for 7 years   Best I can say is talk to your therapist  Keep working through it Ha  I just did that so I can find it at a later point when I want to read it Wow that really sucks   You were sexually assaulted   I'm sorry that this happened to you  It was not your fault and this is not normal behavior for an 11 year old  No means no  And you never have him consent to do any of those things to you  I was in an abusive relationship once and one of the signs is a forceful hickey  I'm glad you're away from this lunatic  Have your guard up and have a plan in case he shows up  Make it clear that contact is not wanted  this may be difficult if you still work together     I'm lucky my momg was there for me  I also have a kid so I know what you mean That's a good idea  thanks I guess I was sort of looking for answers  Typing this up really helped honestly  Any coping strategy's in dealing with OCD and Hocd and the like  any advice would sort of be appreciated  but typing up this post really helped honestly  I have cured from severe depression  but I was diagnosed with anxiety and panic disorders  I wouldn't have been able to cure from depression without my medication  and I managed to stop taking them   Recently I started to feel like I'm not happy anymore although everything is fine in my life  so I started to take meds for my anxiety two weeks ago  and already now I feel so much different  It's like I got a kick to my ass so that I'm able to see how things are in reality   I know many people are against meds in mental health issues  but the truth is  sometimes you just need them  For example in my case  I've accepted that I have anxiety probably my whole life  so I will continue using the meds as long as I need   Stay strong   Wow that sounds really nice  I'm happy you were able to have a good experience with that   If you don't mind me asking what were you using at the time   Drugs have always been a double edged sword for me  even last night at a NYE party I had about six drinks  which I never do anymore  and was left with pretty bad anxiety earlier today   The way you described taking them is actually very in line with how I think they would best be used   A means to getting a foot in the door and establishing comfort  and then hopefully you won't need the drug after that first push  I understand this feeling completely  Both my parents are difficult in different ways  my father has a way of starting debates and then making you feel like your opinion isn't wanted  and my mother feels attacked and  gets hysterical at the smallest inconvenience  I feel like I only truly began to understand my anxiety until I moved back home for a bit after college  I had never realized before that in my home I live in constant fear of setting off my mother's yelling or one of my dad's one sided "political discussions "   I don't know how to feel about this  I love them both and appreciate all that they have done and still do for me  but the fact that they and their inability to deal with their anger molded me into the emotional wreck I am fills me with so much anger sometimes  It makes me sad that I can't wait to get out from under their roof  My dad passed away on November 21st  and before that I was clinically diagnosed with atypical depression and anxiety  but I refused to take medication for it  I always think I have some sort of back pain or illness that isn't actually "real"  at least to the doctors  but to me it's very real   My dad's death has amplified it by 100000 and now I don't have a job and I don't start school until next fall  I know how you feel  very deeply  All I can say is that whatever you feeling may not be real to a doctor or a family member  but it is very real to you and that's all that matters   I would suggest going to a doctor if you can and really pushing the issue  I never did that and now I'm really paying for it  You could also be grieving and that's adding to it as well  but for good measure I would say go and seek help if you can  and really take care of yourself   let me know if you find a way   i just kind of fell into my first normal relationship ever and in the middle of being with him  i had a panic attack and bawled my eyes out for no reason  i'm terrified it will happen again and am sort of avoiding getting into that situation again   This happens to me  often  I can't really give you advice  I'm in therapy to help me process  I like sex still so I'm not going to stop doing that  and I try my best to communicate with my partner when I'm triggered  It's never perfect  but we make it work  and I don't develop resentment as i had in past relationships  where I didn't communicate  Those times  I felt like i was reliving my trauma  and I couldn't tell if I was being hurt and used again  or if I was being loved and appreciated  So i talk  and talk  and talk  and it helps  I feel accepted and loved  he understands  and listens to me    You're not alone in this  Just know that you deserve someone who will walk through this with you  someone who loves you  and you'll get through it  And therapy  Therapy is essential    I don't know why you get it after climax  For me  when I'm at that point  orgasm I mean  I can sometimes feel super vulnerable  raw and exposed  That can trigger me  or something during climax triggers me and that's the result  I don't know if it ever goes away  but it helps that I feel safe and accepted by the person I'm with when it does happen  I know I'll get through it  and I have hope that it will get easier   Do you think I should try talking to my school counsellor   currently in 7th grade  I understand how you're feeling  I have anxiety disorder and my bf broke up with me last week  so I'm having this annoying and pressuring feeling in my chest all the time  like as if I was on the verge of a panic attack   I also started medication for panic and anxiety disorder two weeks ago  so it has helped me in surviving  But the main trick I have learned when I went to therapy is that you should just not be afraid of the feeling  and you know you're gonna survive  The feeling is the worst  but it's gonna go away  I have also problems with my heart rate  I've noticed that my rest heart rate is high af  so it makes it even more difficult to get rid of the feeling  and if I understood right  you have the same   Anyway  I'm here so if you want support or to talk about this more  let me know     I have health anxiety as well and knowing that someone else does has the same symptoms in a way can be reassuring  I get cramping on my left chest side  It's close to my heart so I get scared that it is my heart  even though I know it isn't  I've gotten better as of late in controlling the nervous and anxious feeling but I'm still constantly checking my pulse  It's become a habit  Usually it's normal and I can relax  but it's something I do a lot  Sometimes I cannot control the anxious feeling and I freak out big time  usually because I'll get a pain in my chest or around my heart  For some reason my main concern is my heart because I get an idea in my head that it'll suddenly stop beating or something  I'm only 21 so I know that is ridiculous but the possibility overwhelms me  But as of now I've gotten a lot better  Seriously  I know it's cliche advice  but the best thing to think is "if something was going to happen to me  it would have already happened" Do what you love I've actually dealt with this after a night terror  not just a nightmare    I came back with a clean ECG and diagnosis of a panic attack  The vertigo instability however could be the sign of an inner ear problem Definitely just try to stay by his side  My boyfriend left me last week because he said that I need some time to take care of my anxiety issues I have panic and anxiety disorders   and I can tell you  it's not making this any easier  Of course I'm doing progress but still not having him with me makes me feel like shit   Not to mention we're still going on a booked holiday in a week    Anyway  I know it feels like shit to have problems like your bf does and it's normal that he is maybe pushing you away a bit  And that feels even worse to you  Trust me  he doesn't want to stay away from you  he's probably just trying to protect you  So if you only can  just maybe try to make him seek professional help and stay by his side   I would give anything to still have my bf on my side  so do your best in this  I know it's worth it  Stay strong   3 Doing good and not good  I have panic and anxiety disorders and I had to start taking meds for them two weeks ago  My bf left me because of my problems saying that I need time for myself  We have a booked holiday in a week and we're going there  Doing progress with my problems but can't stop thinking about him  Same  I feel sad and like I want to cry there on the spot when someone uses an extremely assertive voice  They're not yelling but they sound so serious  idk why it makes me scared and sad but it just does   Do you have any history of abusive relationships   Not just romantic  but family  friends  etc    My mom always yelled at me and I've always felt traumatized by it  even when other people are yelling and I'm not even involved  Oh my god  your story sounds so similar to mine  I'm suffering from panic and anxiety disorders  I know  freaking amazing to have both sabotaging my progress    and they ruined the best relationship I've ever had  I know as well that "you should love yourself before loving others"  and I've always had problems with accepting myself  However that changed when I met this guy and everything was perfect  When time passed by I just started to  feel 'like I don't deserve anything and I'm such a waste of time for him   I started to feel better  and then I had a worse moment again due to the start of my meds and then my relationship with this guy was over  In a week we're going for a booked holiday together  Emotions   fucked up  Like you  I want him back but don't know what to do if it turns out he won't want to get back together with me   I talked to my son yesterday  I said that bc he and I have not gotten along well and his game company is doing poorly so he has to go move back to his home state with his family so he can work on his problems  So far my son is most concerned for when my ex gets his cat back and not being able to play games with him anymore  I am hesitant on talking about hurt or safty as my son thought we were always safe and being 6  I still want him to believe that  Luckily my abuser was calculated when he was harmful and was safe around my son and my son only saw two bad arguments  and my son knew we have not gotten along well in months  so I think he understands more than i thought he would  I am just prepping myself for some tricky behavior and knowing I will need to be more patient with him  I've been experiencing this quite a bit recently  It's very hard to explain  but as someone else mentioned it's like your body is present but your mind is somewhere else  You sort of blink and realize you were not totally present  I didn't realize this was something one could experience with anxiety until I talked to someone about it  Seeing this post seems to help more as well  I hope it's helped you to see you aren't alone   Hey OP  I've been feeling some similar symptoms lately   that feeling that I'm always on edge and on the verge of a panic attack  I'm also experiencing some exciting and dramatic changes in my life  and perhaps these changes are what's causing the both of us to experience these anxiety symptoms  Breathing through it helps  and knowing that you are okay is a good thing to remind yourself of when things feel particularly heavy    just wanted to say I feel you  and you're not alone   Hey there  just try to relax   I don't know about your boyfriend  his trip  or anything  But the fact is that he is going and you just have to try to accept it  I know it's not easy  Maybe try to talk with him about this  If he's a good guy he will make this as easy for you as possible   Where are you living  so is there a lot of time change between you two  I'm living in Finland and my ex once went for a training camp in Australia for three weeks  and I admit it was difficult  but we still managed to call at least once a day and then text whenever needed    Unfortunately  You cannot stress for things that will happen in the future  so you just have to live in the moment  I have anxiety and panic disorders so strong that I need to take meds   so I understand what it feels like when the other person is going far away   Yeah like I said  just talk with your boyfriend and I bet everything is gonna be fine  If you need someone to talk to  I'm here  All the best  Good for you  I just wanted to add something to your first goal  if I may    A while ago  I went to a psychologist for my anxiety   I was put on some medicine   it was absolutely dreadful   It made me feel like a zombie  I couldn't experience happiness or sadness  I was just floating through my day   nothing mattered  That is no way to live life  I was probably 13 at the time   I don't remember the medication name  unfortunately   They insisted that it was great for me to be drugged up   stoic 24 7  I ingested these medications for months until I put my foot down because I was tired of not feeling anything  Bizarre    Basically  what I'm getting at is please don't just take their word for it  You know how you feel more than your doctor does  Don't simply take anyone's word ever  not even mine  hah   Research the hell out of the meds before you take them  You want to know what you're putting in your body   how it might effect you  If you decide to take them  be objective  I hope everything works out in your favor     I wish you the best of luck  Happy New Year  Here's to getting over SA  I am very sorry for your loss  I can't imagine what it's like losing a father  I'd probably go nuts   Thanks for understanding me  I don't know anyone with the problems I have and I am ashamed of talking about it with anyone because they might think I'm a weirdo  But yeah "imaginary" illness I've been dealing my whole life  I realized tho that it happened a lot more frequently and more intense when I wasn't studying or working  Keeping my mind occupied is what keeps me sane I think  I'd tell you to get something to occupy yourself with  Especially if you're dealing with your fathers' passing   Thanks for taking the time of reading and replying to my post  I appreciate it   I'll wait till the morning and go to the doctor to see what they think  That happens to me  too  Specifically  the sound of an angry male voice really makes me sad  Even if they're not yelling at me  I really don't like it   Same    For me the first time I went to my family Dr about it  she prescribed Cipralex   My anxiety eventually worsened and I was referred to a psychiatrist and for counseling   I have worked with a psychiatrist for years now  and have been discharged from therapy by my counselor   I would ask to be referred to a psychiatrist of possible  thus skipping the step of waiting for things to get potentially worse   You will most likely be prescribed drugs and I know everyone is different  but I know they have helped me immensely  You may need to try a few different ones to get the right one or mix for you    The best advice I can give is to be completely open and honest  and not hide anything due embarrassment     Good luck  I still don't quite understand it  Is it the same as "spacing out " That happens to me a lot  but I never feel like I'm watching myself  I just "wake up" and realize that I haven't been present  Scary enough  it especially happens when I'm driving   I would recommend checking out RAINN org or Pandora org  I know you say your Mom cant afford to support everyone if he goes to jail  but at the same time  does that mean he gets to keep abusing your sister  Is that the price to be paid to support the family  I know this is really really hard for you  You dont belong in the middle of this  Try talking to RAINN org and Pandora  Your sister will need help  The abuse has some serious impact on her  Not to mention any other kids are at risk  And I wouldnt be surprised if there were CP on the computer or somewhere in the house  Please check out those sites  Talk to someone anonymously there   yeah like to the extent that people comment on it too  and in my head I'm screaming HOLY SHIT JUST STOP TALKING Yep  We're definitely here with you  I've never had anxiety without the physical symptoms  Before  I think I had normal levels of anxiety  but this past year  something changed  I began feeling numbness and tingling in extremities  chest pains  headaches  lightheaded  nausea    It was a crazy year  But I've been meditating  and it's definitely helped with some of the physical symptoms  I'm more mindful of how I tense my muscles and clench my teeth  This sub has helped me tons  Welcome    We should also probably work on our sleep schedule  Lol Hell yeah  go you  Online classes are great   Been there  and it went away  Best way to conqueror any form of anxiety is to just accept it or not care as much or separate it by labeling it as 'ocd not me'  not saying become gay  i'm saying 'oh if im gay then whatever'  well everybody has social anxiety of some form even if you've gotten over the worst of it Wow I'm sorry you are going through this  he sounds like he's embarrassed and if he doesn't want to address the issue then oh well   "bring it up softly"  Sounds like something I have to do to get my bf to listen and understand me  I would definitely get some space for sure  there have been times where my man has gotten grabby and uses his body weight  bigger then me  to force himself on me  I don't like that or to be tickled  long story  but it wasn't until I freaked out and told him to stop did he listen  I survived sexual assault and I'm still kinda messed up when it comes to my sex life   he's patient but his dick is too important to him sometimes   if he gives me space I can eventually get intimate with him again but if he's being an asshole about it then I feel like when he touches me I'm being assaulted again  which in return freaks him out  But yeah it takes a while for my body to respond in a positive way when he touches me  if I'm not in the mood there is no way   at first I wasn't forceful when it came to my space but now I am and he got over it  Wish I can say my issues have gotten better but it's progress   I would talk to him when you are ready and tell him how you feel don't be afraid to get real with him  Explain to him you need to talk about what happened in order to move on in your relationship  If he loves you he will listen and do his best to make you feel comfortable again  Good luck  Hope this helps   Keep exercising  read more  start with my hobbies again  try to limit my time on reddit   I've wanted to try meditation for some time now  Do you have any recommendations on where to start  Hope you'll achieve your goals  u VzVegeta    It can be painful to pull the plug on a relationship in which one has a lot invested  but there are times when it's the wise thing to do  This  I believe  is one of them  A very good rule of life is that when people tell you  or show you  what they are  you ought to believe them  In this case your boyfriend showed you that he is not in control of himself at times  and when he is not in control of himself he is capable of committing serious criminal offences   He says that he "doesn't know what to tell you" and that "he doesn't know why he did what he did " I'm inclined to believe him about that too  It concerns me as much as anything else you've written here  Don't worry man  There are tons of us on the internet  Social anxiety makes communication so hard  its like no one else is on the same page because we're reading in between every line even when there's nothing there  The internet is a great place to practice expressing your ideas and not worrying about what people think  especially in places with anonymity like reddit  It's a bit ironic  My goal is to take therapy seriously and actually trying to connect with people  Isolating myself is only making me worse  How did I get over it  I made lots more mistakes   I accepted that I was going to cringe a lot  but the more mistakes I made  the more I learnt and it got better I have this  too  I start shaking  my heart races  it's just awful  It doesn't even have to be flat out anger  it can just be strongly stated disagreement  Makes me feel like I'm so weak   I can keep it in check by talking with them on the phone  Try keeping in touch with them even if you are not able to be physically close to them   I still feel anxious when leaving them again  I am not sure if it is possible  for me at least to get rid of it completely  I have this problem too and I just try to distract myself until eventually I'm a tiny bit less miserable  I've just come to accept and embrace it as part of my glorious awkwardness  What he did to you is awful and you should not feel ashamed or responsible in any way  You flirting with him does not give him the right to do what he did  It is a sexual assault  there is no other way to call it  You should be careful around this person  he could try you go even further without your consent  he has already proven so    Also  for future reference  I'd recommend you to be careful when sending nudes through Snapchat  There are ways to save the pictures without the sender knowing  I am not able to exercise without music  do you run with music   Reading works for me  some times I have to read the same page multiple times  but after a while I am able to concentrate  After a couple of days my mind wanders less and less when reading   Videogames has also worked  though to a lesser extent  "Hi  Congratulations on making the decision to reach out for help  I made a list of the types of questions you would be asked by a doctor and therapist  I also recommend asking for a blood test to help rule out any potential factors contributing to the way you're feeling like thyroid issues  hormone imbalances  and vitamin deficiencies                                                                      If possible Before seeing a professional  I recommend writing down any symptoms you're experiencing along with context like a brief summary  It can be hard to just write without any direction  so hopefully the questions below can help give some guidance  You don't have to write down your answers to all of these questions  although you are certainly free to do that  Keep in mind that the professional just wants to get a clear picture of your life  so that they can give you the best care possible  Their intention is NOT to interrogate you and get you to confess a crime  They want to help you get better  and in order to do that  they need to know details about your life  When you're finished  consider bringing this paper and just show it to the professional  Here are the questions     what would you like help with  what are your symptoms  when did they first start  how long have they been going on for  how severe would you rate them on a scale of 1 10  how are your energy levels motivation  how is your appetite  how is your sleep quality and how much sleep do you get  have you lost interest in hobbies  do you isolate yourself from others  what is your school social work home life like  basically  the professionals want to know if your struggles are impacting different areas of your life and how much  For example  if you're in school and you're failing classes because you're depressed  it's important to say that you're failing classes   how is your ability to focus and retain information  do you think anything has contributed to the way you are feeling like the death of a loved one  how are your stress levels  do you have a family history of depression anxiety anything else  have you had any thoughts of ending your life and or harming yourself  have you harmed yourself or attempted suicide  do you experience racing thoughts  how would you describe your self esteem  do you feel nervous often  how would you describe your sex drive  none  low  medium  high    do you feel fatigued  how often do your symptoms occur  have you gained or lost weight recently  do you experience any body aches  do you feel like you move or talk slowly  do you ever feel hopeless and or like you've let yourself or others down  are you taking any medication and or supplements and what doses  do you consume any drugs in a recreational manner and if so  how much and how often  	 " shit bro that's the dream  id like a magic wand too please   If you're convinced it's not psychological  why are you on the anxiety board     All symptoms you named can be caused psychosomatically   yeah perhaps you're right actually  I guess it's pretty much like any other insult  not that being gay is bad but I guess it's super detrimental to me  and my mental health when I over analyze myself whether I am actually gay  It's like when someone calls you fat you're like "Whoa am I really fat"   But yeah I should be like "There's nothing wrong with it if I am"   Thanks for the comment anyway  I guess it's nice to know other people have gone through it and it's gone away  Before I got diagnosed with panic disorder  I was a 5 cups a day coffee drinker  But since then  caffeine has been my major trigger  Which sucks  because I fucking loved coffee  And yeah  even decaf triggered me  I'm a flavored water drinker now  Have you tried listening to music when trying to sleep  When I am having trouble sleeping I listen to ambient psybient music  It helps me a lot   I live in a family that yells all the time  Music helps a lot to distract the noise   I feel you  As a result of similar circumstances  I'm also super sensitive to the tone of voice and can detect upset people a mile away  Thanks  mom  Actually when you do the deep breathing you want to be aware of it filling up your lungs and exhaling its basically how meditation works  it also helps get your mind off the anxiety  Have you tried braiding your hair  or used scrunchies   I am sorry if my suggestions are stupid  In my experience making something a hassle has stopped some of my annoying habits  I hope you find a solution that works for you  Yes  as soon as you can human physically possible  Immediately  Tell your counselor before you even go to class  Just walk in and say you need to talk to someone in private right away   I would suggest talking to him   When it happened to me  my now husband was very good to me just as you describe your boyfriend has been in the past   It may be easier if you can talk through it  No Some medications raises your heart rate  maybe that's why yours is a little high   My heart rate was 80 90 when I was medicated  but now I am no longer on any meds and my heart rate is around 55 60bpm resting  Have you tried letting go and just sinking into the feeling on purpose  I mean  yes your body gets scared wheb you start to feel it  but you know for a fact that nothings really going to happen when you give into it  So just give into it and see where you go    But that's just my advice  You don't have to do it if you're not comfortable giving into irrational emotions Nah man I'm not taking any meds by what I know I don't think I can help but I can just offer similar story  I'm 30 yo male soon turning 31  Most of my life I was  and am currently  single  I've never spent Christmas  NYE or Valentines with SO  One small advice  maybe  try not to spend so much time on social networks  Try Facebook and Instagram fasting for a week for example  At the beginning it will be tough but after a few days it will be natural  I find out that there is usually nothing interesting on Facebook  same shit as yesterday  two hours ago  as five minutes ago  Just people trying to convince others that their lives are interesting  valuable    One way to get started is to delete Facebook and Instagram from phone and check them on your computer in the evening  And log off every time   And like someone else suggested  music can help  Some calm ambient music like meditation music can help you stay calm as you guve into it   Thank you  It really made my day  and week      You mentioned you checked your BPM when you experienced chest pains  Do you have a heart rate monitor fitbit apple watch   Thank you For me  when I'm dealing with an anxiety flare up  there's not much my boyfriend can say or do to help  and many times the things he says inadvertently make it worse   My mind isn't rational in those moments  so half of me is imagining these outlandish  "doom and gloom" scenarios where he's cheating on me  or he's not attracted to me  or he doesn't want to be with me  etc   etc   etc    while the other half knows that I'm taking small  insignificant little things and turning them into those doom and gloom prophecies   If we're apart  I'll usually just tell him "I'll talk to you later  I'm not thinking rationally right now   " and leave it at that  then I just let it run it's course   The only thing he can really say that will help even slightly  is to say he loves me no matter what  If we're together  the only things that he can do that help me are to just cuddle with me and tell me he loves me    and I just have to let it run its course   Either way  it's just something I have to suffer through  and there's not much he can do to fix it   It's kind of like a cold    There are things you can do to manage the symptoms  but you'll still have some  even if they are mild  and they won't completely go away until the cold is actually gone     I know it's probably not what you want to hear  but anxiety isn't rational   Nothing you can say or do will make him "snap out of it" because his mind isn't functioning properly in those moments   It's not like when you're on vacation and get lost  when you can just look at a map and see "oh I have to go that way   "  With anxiety  it's more like getting lost in a dangerous place  but for some weird reason you keep blowing up all the roads that would lead you to safety   It doesn't make any sense     I guess what I'm saying  is all you can really do is let him know you love him  cuddle him or hold his hand  unless he says otherwise      and not say anything at all   If he suffers from anxiety often  like every single day     when he has a moment of clarity  I'd sit down and seriously talk about getting therapy or talking to his doctor about it  which I'd do anyway      That's the only "sure" way to deal with anxiety  and even that doesn't work 100     I find listening to podcasts comforting and provides a good distraction when you need a break from your thoughts   Had this pretty badly the day after new years  Forgot to take my pills for a while with all the festivities  it's never been as bad as yesterday tho  I keep ruminating about new years  how I made a fool of myself  was hitting on people who weren't interested  god doing it right now  Nope  Just did it the manual way  Timed myself for 10 seconds  counted my heart beats I generally find it too much trouble to try and find a pulse in my neck wrist  in that amount of time  then multiplied the amount of beats I got by 6 I feel you man  been like that my whole life  pills have been a lifesaver though  also the thought of the vast expanse of space and time and how unimportant my life really is brings me comfort  At least to sleep I turn on a fan and take melatonin  I understand that prescription medications work for some people but I'm against them  want to get over it naturally  but yeah melatonin has been working pretty well for me  good luck  Hehe  I feel the same  it's heartening to see someone else saying this  Sometimes it helps me to see the humour in it  Like an Woody Allen movie  Don't worry  the only problem you have is the way you feel about it  you are doing everything else right  Okay  If this worries you I'd suggest going to the doctor and get them to test your heart  They can lend you a heart rate monitor and see if your values are normal or not   When I measure my heart rate at the doctor it can be as high as 80 90bpm  but my resting heart rate is way lower  Not really for in the moment of it  but the past year has helped me gain confidence and see the world a bit differently  With some huge  to me  changes with a work relocation followed by a new job  and a minor accident I found it was the changes they bought around for me that helped me most  A friend helped and encouraged me throughout to trying new  safe things  Going to places I hadn't been before  I even tried dancing  which was something I ruled out from a kid  Now I intend to go more regularly  Perhaps some regular safe things just outside his comfort zone that you can do together may help a little  I can't thank my friend enough for how much they've helped me through the changes  I feel much more able and happy  A few minor blips but I'm now grateful for the changes forced on me  I'm sure you're doing great in being so supportive  I get them daily  They're usually random and short  but sometimes they can last forever it seems  Left chest  right chest  sternum  random areas of the rib cage  shoulder blades etc  It's perfectly normal IMO  but if you're truly worked  see your doc and see what they can do for you  http   www brainphysics com yourenotgay php  I recommend checking out this article to anyone with homosexuality themes in OCD   it's written by a gay OCD sufferer who REALLY knows what he's talking about    If you're finding that typing out an account of your probable HOCD symptoms helps you feel better  consider that maybe you're using typing it out as a compulsion  Does it make you feel more at ease in the immediate short term  a bit 'reassured'  but then later you've got a bit of an urge to go type out more of it  or you feel you need more reassurance that you're not gay  It's just a guess  but it can be a bit of an indication  A lot of us with OCD  myself included  find that writing out long descriptions of how our symptoms must mean our obsession is DEFINITELY not true and DEFINITELY ridiculous makes us feel better temporarily  It's the reason a lot of OCD sufferers are now writing great books about what it's like to have OCD      If you just mean that writing it down is helping you get a clearer picture of what's happening  then obviously that's not the same thing and it's perfectly fine  I'm not saying this to accuse you of anything  just to make you aware that it's really common for a lot of us with OCD to accidentally aggravate our symptoms by checking doing rituals seeking reassurance writing down self reassuring things  and that we usually feel better when we re train our brains not to over analyse and ruminate like this   Do consider seeing a proper therapist about potential OCD  if these symptoms persist  It's always easier to fix OCD if you catch it early  than if you let it carry on for years and years  because your brain's pretty mouldable and changeable  and you start to 'rewire' it into a worse and worse OCD habit the more you do compulsions around the idea of being gay  It's a real  serious medical problem and you deserve real  proper help with it if you feel you need it  It's fine to be independent  but   ya know  opening up to a non judgy  confidential professional can still be the right thing to do  independence or no  Yes  I hate when people pity someone just because they didn't spend NYE partying with others  Well  this applies generally  not only to NYE   It sounds like you are in a really tough situation right now  My best advice would be to first avoid anything intoxicating   it's likely not the cause of your reaction  but it can certainly amplify anything you are feeling or going through  Otherwise  you should make seeking therapy your number one priority  With ptsd  whatever you are going through is normal and you are not alone  But it does sound like you really could use some real help  and even if you can't get it immediately  just working towards figuring out how you can can help you more than being on your own  Are there any support groups in your area you might be able to attend    I've been there myself  with the drinking and the freak outs  and while I never hurt anyone  i hurt myself a lot instead  I was violent to myself   Please forgive yourself  You can press on  you can get through this  Please understand that what you are going through happens to a lot of people with ptsd  We are in so much pain we wind up doing things to protect ourselves  it's like instinct  The pain is almost stamped into our minds  and sometimes that shapes how we react to today more what actually happens today  It happens to the best of us  and I more than understand how it feels to have that happen  and to come up with every terrible way to feel and see yourself after  But you are hurting  you are in pain  and no human has all the tools equipped to handle that  Not a single person  So forgive yourself  Have hope that you can make yourself whole again  because you can   I took it for 3 days  then switched to buspar on the 3rd day  My stomach ache was mostly gone by the day after I had a day this week where I couldn't make it out of the driveway but the next day I made it out just fine  Some days just suck more than others I guess  Are you diagnosed with OCD    If not  this doesn't necessarily have very much to do with OCD  Your flatmate just sounds like a somewhat unhygienic sort of person  but anyone  with or without OCD  can find someone else's personal habits gross  Personally I would say you're justified to ask him to clean any part of the problem that affects you  i e  the smell   but not so justified to ask him to clean parts that don't  I  e  the sheets  Only he has to sleep on them  after all    If you have a diagnosed case of OCD  you can probably temporarily request a higher level of cleanliness  since it causes you genuine psychological distress and it's discrimination against your disability for someone to deliberately trigger your mental health problem   but in the long run  therapy and medication so you can better tolerate more variation in someone else's hygiene can be a good idea too  I mean  we all have to live with mucky people sometimes      Yep  it's like celebrating a birthday which i find weird  because i'm getting older and hence more regret etc    But to be fair I know it's just the lack of social skills  and the anxiety   It's the "not knowing what to do after  hi  or  are you enjoying the party  " line or the awkwardness in finally approaching someone you have been walking towards when they're right in front of you that made me get too insecure and become awkward   For what it's worth I've seen 2 or 3 people at random act like this before where it wasn't me  so I have a sense of what it looks like from the outside  People can tell you're awkward but ultimately they don't judge too hard and if they make remarks like "I get the feeling you want to be part of the conversation" or something  they don't do it to point out how awkward you are but to air out the awkwardness and give you a chance to join in   And lastly  I kinda did enjoy going after all  Normally I get really sad during New Year's Eve in previous years because I've had two years when I didn't go to anything and just stayed with my mom who didn't have any guests either  and it just felt lonely  To me NYE is the day when you recollect your thoughts and think back on everything that's happened for one year and it can be quite sad when you realize you haven't really moved an inch  so at least  this year I could tell myself I was at a place where people had fun and I like the memory of being around people as opposed to feeling isolated  Only a minor setback   I used to have it much more  I guess I've just kinda learned to make myself more      present  If that makes sense  Hi folks   I'm having a really tough time trying to handle my anxiety lately  I'm hoping to seek some new coping methods and identify more about my anxiety in the future  Thanks for having me  Finding the "reason" may not be possible now or really solve much  I think that treating the anxiety response and learning to cope with the symptoms may be the best path to discovering the root  My emotional overreactions completely cloud my ability to find reason  Mindfulness based stress reduction helps me quite a bit  as did developing my crisis protocol  which is a list of tasks that work best for me when I'm overwhelmed by anxiety  Regaining control of my ability to respond to stress helps me cope with the root problem   They truly are  And definitely a great stepping stone towards taking a class that requires your physical presence   People on reddit are super annoying with the downvotes and use them wroge all the time  They don't even realize it discourages a good discussion  I usually just end up deleting my comment when it gets below 0 after a few hours  Primarily cognitive obsessive compulsive disorder  also commonly called "primarily obsessional OCD"  purely obsessional OCD  Pure O  OCD without overt compulsions or with covert compulsions  is a lesser known form or manifestation of OCD   Commonly referred to as Pure O by the OCD community  Pure O is a form of OCD where people mistakenly believe that it differs from traditional OCD  in that it features no outward compulsive manifestations  instead  the anxiety inducing obsessions take place only in the mind    However  a person with Pure O will still have compulsions which mainly manifest as unseen mental rituals  and they will usually also engage in compulsive behaviours like seeking reassurance from loved ones  and avoidance of particular objects  places or people  They are compulsions  nonetheless  which is why the term Pure O is somewhat imprecise   Pure O is like any other form of OCD  it will involve both obsessions and compulsions which are the problems that need addressing through Cognitive Behavioural Therapy  CBT    Understanding Pure O by Scott   This Understanding Pure O guide may help you further understand this often misunderstood form of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder   Taken from Wiki and OCD UK   No  if you don't want to wait to see your doctor  call tomorrow and explain your issue over the phone   SSRIs just aren't particular great drugs for OCD  They're 40  years old  they don't work on the actual neurotransmitters that are probably the main problem in OCD  they weren't even designed for OCD in the first place  and the side effects are often unhelpful to recovery  We all talk like it's 'normal' to have to try 20 different meds and waste months of our lives on side effects and withdrawal and waiting for them to 'kick in'  but actually    is this really the best we can do  Really   D  So don't worry that it's you that's not responding properly  They're genuinely just patchy drugs that mysterious don't work on some people  Some people get a great response to them and it luckily takes away their symptoms 100   others  like me  take Anafranil Clomipramine and find that it doesn't exactly stop the OCD symptoms  but it takes the edge off them and makes them more manageable  Others find nothing whatsoever happens   There's some research that you might find useful in your situation  explaining  maybe  why Anafranil works for some people but not others  Apparently  it could be to do with the amount of brain 'growth factor' substance you have   https   blogs scientificamerican com scicurious brain using bdnf to predict antidepressant response     It's called BDNF if you want to Google it  brain derived neurotrophic factor   and it just means that maybe Anafranil mostly just works by making your brain more changeable and flexible and able to grow new connections   but if you don't supply the Anafranil with this BDNF  it may not work  Apparently you can increase your BDNF levels a lot by doing things like meditation  exercise  getting good sleep  learning new things and eating well  which is probably one mechanism why doing these things tend to make those of us with OCD feel better   It's not totally certain research  but it might show that your Anafranil needs some input  therapy or lifestyle changes on your part to help it work well   Also  making sure your brain has enough of the right other chemicals to rebuild itself and regrow healthier new pathways can be useful  There's some evidence that getting extra of particular nutrients can make Anfranil and other SSRIs more effective  http   www news medical net news 20160426 Nutritional supplements can enhance effectiveness of antidepressants aspx    Obviously this isn't saying 'eating totally random vitamin pills magically makes SSRIS work LOL '  but it is saying that we know that things like Omega 3s and Vitamin D help the brain to work more smoothly and calmly  and they can work together with your Anafranil to improve the effect   Obviously  there are other practical things you can do to try and improve the effect of your Anafranil too   increasing the dosage  for example  I noticed a difference when I went from 100mg Anafranil to 200mg  Getting good sleep can be important too  because some research suggests that it's during sleep your antidepressant REALLY does the hard work of re wiring and re organizing your brain  again  I found that my OCD improved more slowly if I had insomnia     Basically  the situation with meds can be more complex than just which SSRI you put into your body  But the good news is that there's probably lots of things in your control that you could do to try and get the drugs working at maximum capacity    Not everyone is the same or has the same reactions to different substances   I have anxiety with or without caffeine  but with caffeine it gets a lot worse   But everyone is different  Probably       changing my wants because of my  "inabilities" Save up the   you used to spend on those 5 cups of coffee   after a year  buy yourself something really cool   That could ease some of the pain  Practice  Doing deep belly breathing several times a day can help you develop the skill and create positive associations with the effects of it    deleted                     0 5360      What is this   https   pastebin com 64GuVi2F 74306  Thank you guys for the advice    I was young when my parents got a divorce but they would always yell so hard  Especially my dad  he has anger issues he'd shout and kick his feet on the ground   I remember hiding under the table because I was so afraid and my brother would tell me I was overreacting  My fears were always looked at as exaggerating and "I had to grow up"    Loud noises scare me and whenever someone gets annoyed or angry I'm afraid they would shout at me or hit me   Yo I've probably read that article you've linked maybe 5 times already in the past 3 months  so I think I get what you mean about the whole 'Ruminating' and 'seeking reassurance' and I really understand that it isn't healthy anymore   But in a way this almost feels different it feels nice to be just open about what my feelings are here  and I mean when I type it out and confess it to someone else it does almost make it seem silly  but you're right this is kind of a first step towards talking to a professional about it   But just talking about my issue and understanding the feelings a little better does relieve some stress even if its only in the short term  But I guess I'll keep on going  if there's any other links you've got that might help me feel  free to link them  I'll give them a once over and try and stop going back to them after today and just try techniques that the first comment talked about   thanks again for the help  Really appreciate it  Especially the honesty  I read that as choking the children and I was  REALLY  confused for a minute there wow I'm tired Thank you  I appreciate it   After seeing all these comments I can see how many people have this problem as well    I'm slowly explaining my boyfriend about this and I've told him I'm sometimes afraid he'd hit me even if I don't think he's that kind of a person    It's a horrible thing to expierence  I think people should at least apologise after shouting so that we know we didn't deserve to be yelled at    I can live with it to be honest  if people can be understanding towards it that is   Being told you're overreacting and you're not being your usual "you" sucks   This is a part of me now and it's not a feeling I can control  Hello   My experience might be different since I met a psychologist first  which later referred me to a psychiatrist so that I can get prescription meds  For me  to talk about my problems to a stranger was too overwhelming and I'll tend to forgot important things  so I would suggest to write them in short notes beforehand so that you can tell them the problem that need most immediate attention and later you can disscuss more about other problems in future sessions   During first session  they usually ask you why you came  what bothers you most  how it affects your functioning and life  your backgrounds  family etc  to get to know and understand you better  Sometimes they might ask you to do some test  like depression anxiety scale or sth  forgot the name  but that really depends on your problems  They MIGHT prescribe you some medications to REDUCE the symptoms  not treat them  and you might need to attend therapy  which actually helps in the long run  In the end  the goal is for you to be able to cope with your problems without any meds  so don't just think the meds are the answers   And if they think you need meds  they might take some blood as baseline  as some meds have certain side effects   I've heard about some other people who went to GP first and referred to psychiatrist  while there are some people who went to see the psychiatrist staright away  No matter what you do  getting help is the biggest and most important step  so don't forget to give credit to yourself     And there are also people who doesn't actually have anxiety depression  anything  but it's really okay  so don't worry  just go see them    Don't be like me  who thought my problems weren't that important and by the time I finally decided to get help  everything had already blown out of proportions    I finally texted my boss and asked if I could get more morning shifts instead of evenings  It was so scary cause earlier I thought evevnings would be better for me and so I told my boss that I want to work at evenings  Anyway now I've realized that I like my job more when I get there at morning even it means that I have to wake up at 4 am  but even that is better than sitting at home all day crying and having anxiety because the waiting is so stressfull   Hey  Thanks for the suggestion I am currently looking into it  But then my question is doing so aren't you becoming more aware of things  Like wont your thoughts still be there   I have same problems and I've been working on it too    Currently  whenever I have those thoughts  I would stop and remind myself to take one thing at a time  and the future will decide itself  I will do relaxation and breathing technique  exercise  yell "STOP " and go on doing whatever I want to do without thinking about anything  Basically  I try to distract myself rather than focusing on those thoughts  I heard that some people actually took a pen and wonders about the colour  shape  every lines  nook and cranny of the pen to stop the negative thoughts    There's also a set of questions that helps to challenge those thoughts  google "challenging negative thoughts" or do this exercise http   www moodjuice scot nhs uk challengingthoughts asp   It might not help you instantly but I find that the more I do this  the less time I spend mulling on negative thoughts     Hope that helps    I finally start talking to people at school  I was very happy  And the attacks are getting milder and bearable these days    Sorry for the late reply  haven't used reddit in ages  yes I have very low body fat   To be honest  it's a good thing that you try to solve your current task  rather than moving from one another and leaving them incomplete  This is amazing  The world is your mirror  Good idea I'm sure this is a meme or something    I was repeatedly emotionally abused  no  tormented  for years after my father's death  I was the only one to deal with the brunt if my mom's episodes  she'd kick me out and if I refused to come home she would threaten me  Once I would return home  this happened many times  she would be in the psych ward for about a week and there was sharpie all over the walls lying about how nobody cared about me and my dead dad 'never wanted me'  I was 10 when he died  he was my everything and he spoiled me with love  Finally  after being the victim of all of her abuse  I was freed right before my 15th birthday  By finding her dead in her bed  At least she died from something other than suicide    It's been 4 years and I still have nightmares almost every night of her coming and stalking me  and running her normal mental tormentation routine  It feels real every times  I want to miss my mom  but I don't remember the real her  All I remember is her disease and the torment  And how she looked when I found her  Just typing that last sentence was hard   I feel like shit for not being upset with her death  She was torturing me and her life itself was torture  she wanted to die so bad   Hell  I'd probably have killed myself if she hadn't died   Now I'm happy with my high school sweetheart and we're getting married and he holds me when I have attacks and takes such good care of me  Tl dr  orphan kid suffers greatly from now dead abusive mother I recently cut most caffeine out of my life  which has made a huge improvement in my anxiety and how I feel  I still drink decaf coffee because it's hard giving up coffee and the coffeehouse ritual completely  I only ever notice anything if I have two cups of decaf   Thank you for sharing your opinion  3 Im 44 and 6 feet tall yet kids make my anxious  Its because they dont have a filter yet and will say anything    Kids learn by pushing boundaries which is why he threw the ball at you anyway but lightly  to see if he could get away with it  The problem is that depending on the parents they might not approve of you "teaching" their child so it leaves you in an awkward spot    In your example is sounds like the parents are the problem as this kid is disrespectful to everyone  Used to have severe vertigo  Started taking OTC magnesium because I was low on blood tests  Lots of praying went into the magnesium  It has quite literally negated my vertigo issues  Though  they're big ass pills  I could barely change oil in my vehicle  or have my teeth cleaned  Because as soon as I looked up it would set off an attack  After taking magnesium for nearly a year and a half  praying that stuff actually works  it finally left  I still have minor attacks sometimes   I relate to some of the things you mentioned  I think about things I worry about pretty much literally 24 7 and sometimes if it's really bad my brain will feel like it's literally tired or strained  Like the muscles in my brain are tensing up or something  I think odds are I just stress myself out so much to the point I give myself a mild headache from time to time  I can also relate to the hair pulling  something I rarely do but am trying to stop at any rate  Whenever I get violent thoughts they usually revolve around myself  but I've definitely been through your situation of imaging them happening to other people and it sucks  it's awful  For me when it comes to reading I tend to feel like I didn't fully comprehend a sentence I read because my mind is always going a hundred miles an hour so I'll read the same line over and over again until I feel sure that I understood exactly what it said    I don't really have any great advice since I'm kind of in the same boat as you  But I just wanted you to know you're definitely not alone in this kind of stuff  What I'm going to try to do is do more things that are beneficial for me  I find I feel really great after I exercise  Like  it sucks during the actual exercise but once I finish I feel all this adrenaline and I feel really proud of myself for accomplishing something even if it's small  My brother was also kind enough to loan me a book on anxiety that I'm going to genuinely try to finish instead of just read the first few pages like I normally do with self help books  And lastly I'm gonna give meditation a try  I think it's helpful to just try to clear your mind of all the junk your ocd is trying to feed you all day and let your body just exist for a moment in peace  Not saying you've gotta do all those things  but those are always options  Seeing a therapist if you're not already could also really help  although I haven't exactly taken my own advice on that yet  Sorry this comment was so long but best of luck  For me personally I think I make myself feel very ostracized rather than me actually ostracized  I've pretty shitty self esteem so even in groups of friends I enjoy being with I tend to think things like "you're so pathetic  why would anyone want to be your friend  they'd have a much better time if you weren't around" or "you think anyone actually wants to hang out with you  you should have just stayed home"    I did go through a pretty rough patch in late high school  I'd move from a town where I'd lived for 7 years and had many friends  I moved three times in one school year and had a lot of trouble making new friends  To add salt to the wound  all the wonderful friends I thought I had back at my old home never did much on their part to keep in touch  Only one of them kept in touch and it really hurt me because it made me feel like none of them ever really considered me that good of a friend after all  I'm not sure if it could cause the onset of OCD symptoms  It's always possible  Even if it didn't cause the initial onset  that's a very stressful and emotionally straining situation to be in  so I feel sure it could definitely worsen or flare up OCD symptoms   Thanks for the advice  I mean I understand I won't die or anything from ring worm  Being on the road and last night in a hotel I have felt really out of my element I guess and everything has been stressing me out more than usual    I know I have to face my fears eventually  But I'm not sure I'm strong enough right now lol  But I'll try to hopefully  Thanks for the response again   One of the worst guilt I've ever felt probably came from my violent obsessions  I knew I didn't want to act on any of them  even if I was angry  but I still felt like a horrible person  Like  "what kind of daughter has thoughts about doing horribly violent things to her parents "  The violent thoughts grew from me fearing hurt people to just picturing violent things in general and it got so bad I just didn't want to leave my house or even my room  I felt terrified but also very emotionally numb  It's probably one of the worst places I've been in my life when it comes to my ocd  Thankfully it hasn't been quite that bad in a while  as far as the violent thoughts at least   The last girl I dated  I was 19 years old  I did not understand this sickness at all at that point and I was having a major episode one day  she ended up calling me a "pussy " I'll never forget it    The issue with people yelling is it is in a lot of people's personality  That is just kind of the way they know they can get people's attention  Some people  let's say athletes  respond very well to yelling    But then there is people like you and me and probably everyone else reading this that respond so negatively to yelling  that it ruins our days and potentially our weeks  It takes something out of us    We ain't alone yo   That's pretty much my viewpoint as well  no bad kids  just bad parents  As I said though  what gets to me more  is that I can't command respect  I'm kind of in the same place  I used to have super bad harm thoughts which gave me super super bad anxiety and depression  Now whenever I have them it's almost like I brush them off  but I think that's just because my mind is giving priority of sorts to my more dominant obsessions  But honestly  the fact that you're freaking out about it is a pretty good indicator that you have no actual will to act on your thoughts and never will  Just keep in mind ocd is a pesky little thing  likes to play tricks on you and the things you most never want to do  Yeah  it's gonna find some way to make you think you actually do  ocd's mean like that  Congrats on going  My visit was very simple  I noted on my paper that I was having depression and anxiety issues  they had me fill out a form before I came back so that they knew what the visit was about   and I explained my issues to my doc  at which point I was prescribed anti anxiety medication that changed my life for the better    pretty simple stuff  Yeah this makes sense  Now after sleeping some and thinking about it  I understand ringworm isn't very dangerous  It's curable and everything  Also my family who has it is acting very normal  they aren't nervous at all    I'm still by far the most nervous in my family about getting ringworm but I'm trying to get over that fear  Once home  there isn't much I can do  But my state of mind right now is if I continue performing tasks  there is a chance I won't get ringworm still  I don't know I'm pretty sure I'm freaking out over nothing but you know how it is lol  Thank you for the response though   As a server  I totally feel this  OMG same here   I act so weird whenever I'm anxious people wonder what's wrong with me  While I certainly understand the aggravation and anxiety this caused you   I also suffer from OCD  you have to realize a lot of these things are considered normal behavior  outside he toothpaste spit  She had no idea a lot of those common things would cause you a level of anxiety she honestly has never experienced    In a positive turn    you made it through it   All those things you deem dangerous didn't get you  This was a great exercise in exposure for you    Just remember your sister most likely didn't do anything on purpose   Whenever I drink I tend to drink with a group of close friends  I can't bring myself to drink around a large group of people with maybe only one good friend since I have diabetes  and have constant anxiety that the alcohol might effect my blood sugar dangerously  But with a group of friends I know I can trust I always drink enough that I get decently drunk  Personally for me whenever I drink everything is pretty great for the most part  I feel relaxed and happy and like dancing around  not a single worry on my mind  Once things calm down a bit I tend to get slightly depressed but it's nothing too bad  I've found however that I do obsess a lot on things I did or said when drunk  I'll dwell and dwell worrying that my actions have a reflection on my sober self  even though I could never imagine my sober self doing or saying half the things I do or say when I'm drunk  But it's hard to disconnect it  you know  When you're constantly uncertain about what you really want  sometimes getting drunk isn't the best thing   Hahaha  Thanks  Yeah I mean I see nothing else that could help me  I really want to be normal again  Hoping cbt will be the way to go  At the end of the day I keep thinking about how I was before 2014 and looking at my self now I just ask myself "how did this happen "  Damn hope that guy is doing alright    Exactly  Whenever I tell someone the duration of my suffering they just act shocked  It's literally in overdrive and I want this to go away before I completely isolate myself from everyone everything  I can slowly feel it happening    Yeah when I get into bed I feel sane again  Which is why I have a hard time getting out of bed  Takes me a good 20 mins or so to mentally prepare myself that I have go out of my room  Yup even 30 seconds peace is a gift from God  But I would only get that peace once in bed     Thanks for your comment mate  It's good just to talk about this to people who are in the same boat as me    Same for me putting things down  I need the "just right" feeling or I'll constantly keep picking something up and putting it back down until it does  It sucks when it happens in front of people because then I don't want anyone to notice and think I'm weird so I'll stop sooner than I normally would and don't always get that "just right" feeling   I do talk a lot so if you want to skip to the pretty bit it starts around 7 30    I was diagnosed with anxiety a couple of weeks ago  They have prescribed me Etizolam  Since the diagnosis  even before I had begun my medication  I used to feel extremely dizzy and nauseous  Once I started taking the medication  I have been getting random spells of dizziness  but it is much better  I usually try to pull myself to the reality during these spells by doing something that interests me  like browsing  reading  watching funny videos  music etc  But yes  I do believe that dizziness is related to anxiety and depression  Here's how I dropped a large part of my negative thinking  I looked at it as "reverse narcissism"   Why should all these bad things happen to me or my loved ones  but I don't think they're going to happen to other people  I found myself doing mental gymnastics to imagine horrendous torrents of events occuring to myself and I realized that I was singling myself out   for better or worse   by imagining that I was going to be the victim of these bad events  I was acting like I was the center of the universe  but for bad stuff    Look into the concepts of CBT and mindfulness  which is not so much an attempt to "think positive" as it is a method of eliminating regretting the past or being anxious of the future  I still struggle with believing negative thoughts much more easily than positive ones  i still feel as though it's what I'm meant to do  I feel like I'm supposed to have a negative view of myself   But what helped me was thinking positive thoughts that were actually true or believable rather than something big  Grand positive thoughts made me feel worse  so thoughts like  I am beautiful  I am enough  I am going to be ok were just too big  Smaller thoughts or thoughts I knew to be true were better like  I have a safe place to sleep at night  I am fighting my anxiety depression  These thoughts didn't contradict my negative views so they were easier to introduce into my thought pattern  And then I was able to use this as a base to introduce more positive thoughts  bigger thoughts that really gave me a more positive outlook   Yeah the idea of getting therapy can be scary  And lots of people feel like their problems aren't proper problems  and that they should just suck it up or whatever  But I can assure you that your therapist isn't going to say anything horrible like that  I mean that would just be dickish and help precisely nobody  Their job is to help you  not to put you down  I'm just some random guy on the internet  so all I can do is encourage you  go for it  You've already managed a first step that lots of people don't  by deciding that you want to see a therapist  You can do the next one  too  Thank you for the reply  I had tried betablockers but they just really made me feel terrible  then I was put on Citalopram and have been on that for about 4 months now  Strange thing is  the dosage does not seem to run parallel with the dizziness either  Maybe it's time for me to try a different medication again   That's good  You can go back to college in the future but sometimes you have limited time to find a lasting job  Nice   Good on you  I did the same thing  What work will you be looking for  I'm looking for some as well Kill myself    because apparently  they are very racist to foreigners in Iran    uh huh  no     In the 1990s  Iran sheltered a staggering 4 5 million exiles from Afghanistan and Iraq  the largest refugee caseload any single country has handled in modern times  The numbers have shrunk in the last few years to slightly more than two million people  but that figure is still twice as high as anywhere else  And because of the unsettled regional political and military situation  Teheran may have to continue to shoulder this burden for some time to come   The Afghans received heavily subsidized state food  health and education packages and many refugees  including women  found local employment    http   www unhcr org en us publications refugeemag 3b6814092 refugees magazine issue 108 afghanistan unending crisis iranian surprise html No  you shouldn't have to deal with that  Tell him  that's disgusting  I had a roommate that never washed  same thing  smelly feet  never washed clothes  It was vile  It's not asking to much to live in a place without constant body odor   Man  take it easy    Focus on an objective  not on the status  You made this post to get something off your chest and now i'm giving you the feedback you want to hear  That is the purpose of your post  to talk and exchange ideas  it is irrelevant whether it gets upvotes or not  thanks man I feel like they will say nothing is wrong and I'm wasting my life and now to tell my parents the next scary step Thank you for your advice  Yeah I don't want to take them as apparently they can cause insomnia and my sleeping pattern is already pretty messed up  which can't be helping my SA  I don't think they will particularly help so until I've given therapy a go  I'm holding out  Happy new year and the same to you  Diagnosing yourself by listening to random strangers on the internet is more than iffy  obviously  but to me it seems like you are checking a whole bunch of depression boxes there  yeah  Feelings of being stuck  lack of perspective for the future  finding it really difficult and exhausting to do normal things  feeling inferior or even worthless  those are all things that sound like depression to me   You mentioned that you're in uni  Have you checked whether your university has a psychological counseling type of thing  It's not the same as therapy  but I thought it was really helpful  Maybe you could also see if there are any self help type groups in your city  Small amounts of chocolate don't contain much caffeine  it's about 3 mg or less for 10 g of milk chocolate  and 7 7 mg to 19 8 mg for dark chocolate  with the dark one having the most  according to  this  http   www amanochocolate com articles how much caffeine is in chocolate    Same    I got yelled at for everything I did growing up  And my step dad did crazy shit like putting cameras in our bedrooms  When I was somewhat social he would listen in on my phone calls and read my text messages  Wasn't allowed to have friends  Now my whole life is just wake up   browse internet   sleep   repeat  I can't talk to anyone  Don't expect too much of yourself  Education can always be returned to  never forget that  If it gets too much for you  so be it  Try your best but don't allow yourself to suffer as in the end your health is much more valuable  Utilise the people studying with you and teachers  ask for help when you need it and make sure you have time to yourself away from your school work   Best of luck to you  You can do it  I have  I'm still a teen but i have no idea how to act around younger kids it's awkward  For example  when they stare at me i know it's because i'm ugly which makes me uncomfortable or when they harass me physically i don't know what to do  do i just yell at them with the mom right there  do i ignore it  I can relate to what you say  If it's due to anxiety you shouldn't get fined  I'm guessing you're not going out having fun instead of going to school  so you're fine  Anxiety sucks  I'm sorry it's kicking your ass  They're definitely not gonna say that  I mean  you're probably sick of hearing this  but you're 16  You've got most of your life ahead of you  man  If anything  look at it like this  getting serious about caring for your mental health at such a young age is gonna give you a head start  Learning techniques for dealing with shitty feelings and limiting behavior patterns and so on is something I know for a fact lots of people wish they had done earlier in life    And yeah  haha  I'm practically a dinosaur compared to you and talking to my parents about how I needed therapy was scary as hell  Took me forever to muster up the courage  But you know what  They were really great and supportive about it  You can do this  Thanks and yeah I live had a bad day  thanks man you are the nicest person I have met on this site and I will get back to you after my therapy  thank you   Good for you  My similar experience was finally going to the local dnd club  Now i go almost every weekend  Anxiety is not a mind set  It comes from being around douche bags  There is no undoing what he did  Half hearted apologies are not going to take away from the fact that he broke serious boundaries and severely damaged your trust in him    I know it will be painful and difficult  but I would really consider ending the relationship  This is fantastic  I have anxiety  and know how hard things can become    Really proud of you  Chocolate can have quite a bit of caffeine and other stimulants in it  Congrats  Are you Dutch by any chance  I noticed you spelled "Success" with only one "s"     Thanks a lot  It's definitely of great help  If you don't mind  what is the book you're reading  I myself go through karnegie's 'how to win friends  etc' because my social skills gone really awful  And I feel stress relieved when I use techniques from the book while communicating with people  Thanks a lot for your reply and good luck to you  Yes  that's something to consider  Thanks a lot for your comment   How about doing the opposite  Instead of pushing him off you grab him harder  Reach out to him instead of pushing him away  Not sure if talking to him in such detail would be helpful it might freak him out  Face my fears regularly   I get this  too  It's one of those anxiety feedback loops  The stress of being very anxious causes those overwhelming emotions  which makes us more anxious     Try not to give weight to them  They may feel very real and genuine  but their cause is chemical  It's the hormonal stress response that is creating them    As difficult as it is you need to stop analyzing it  It will drive you crazy  You are not an awful person for this  our minds spit out like 40 000 thoughts a day and every one of them is not going to represent you as a person  so disregard that thought as it is not evidence that you are awful  Your friend was not harmed touched  there is no harm done  try your best to stop thinking about it    You should absolutely ask her out  You only get one life to live and you never want to wonder about "what if"  You always want to be unique and separate yourself from the pack when it comes to women and truthfully one of the best ways to do that is to simply ask her out in a direct manner  something that not many guys are able to do  Do not be one of those guys that my buddy and I have called "spec ops"  those guys that have this massive agenda from the start and try to weasel their way into a girls pants one year at a time  If you get rejected don't dwell on it because the energy that you spend thinking about her and the rejection is time that you could have used to meet and ask out another woman  Good luck   Can I just tell you  you inspire me  I'm 26 years old  divorced once  remarried and struggle with doing anything for myself  I let fear control my life  I'm afraid to do anything alone    I screen captured this and will be using it for inspiration  You're amazing   I got my anxiety from the majority of people around me being negative and treating me like shit  Now I'm almost 22 and missed out on so much life experience I'll probably never recover Are you registered as a student with a disability   My school had resources for people struggling  I was offered to write my exams in a private room with no time limits  I was able to easily defer exams if I was unwell with my mental health  and they just generally accommodated what students needed  They offered note takers too  if attending or paying attention in class was difficult   My anxiety was bad   I ended up deferring a few exams and wrote them the following week  It was nice being registered though  because if I ever needed more help  I knew it was there   You can do this  Just take it one day at a time    I'm sorry that you experience it too  but at the same time  it feels nice to know that I'm not the only one  I don't quite get flashbacks  but deja vu is the closest word experience that I can think of  but I didn't remember the word til you wrote it     I do the distractions to try to drown it out  Sometimes it works  and sometimes it doesn't  I wish I could find something that worked at least 90  of the time  but even combining activities  I'll often chew gum  squeeze silly putty in my left hand  color in an adult coloring book with my right hand  and have a "light" show going on  sometimes isn't enough  I've been working on the breathing too   After I posted this last night  I searched on youtube for emetophobia  There was a video where a girl described her fears and how she got past them  She said 2 things that really stuck with me  1  getting sick and throwing up isn't something that just happens out of the blue  it's a defense mechanism that your body has to get rid of bad stuff  And 2  what's going to happen is going to happen regardless of if you're afraid or not  I can relate to this because its been so relevant for me this year  Im approaching the end of university and that means that the real  adult world is barreling at me  In terms of my social life my social anxiety disorder is the best that its ever been and things are looking up  However  I am now coming to the realization that social anxiety disorder is going to have a profound impact on my professional life      I have only had one ever job that doesnt have anything to do with my field of study  Ive never had a big people job  My resume is empty  I have no network contacts at all  I have a mentor but am too afraid to contact him and im worried that hes angry with me    It just really sucks when you figure out out how to manage social anxiety in one area of your life but also figure out that its out of control in another   Yep   that sounds very familiar for sure  I truly hope that you can communicate openly with him about it  If you truly think in your heart that he's someone to remain committed to  let him know you'll do anything before it's too late  And if it helps you to talk about it have you talked to a professional   No problem  I get sick a lot from stress  the only way I usually am sick  as it ruins my immune system  so I can completely understand  Yes it does help to feel that we're not alone  I don't wish HA to anyone but it's great to have such a great community on Reddit Aw  I'm sorry about your relationship  I hope things work out well for you   No worries  Thanks for your reply  Like I said where I am there is no form of support and to this day I think I am the only one here going through this    Yeah  Like going home for me at the end of the day is the worst coz I have to do all my rituals so I can go to bed   At time I'll just stay outside and not go home   If you don't mind me asking can you tell me about your cbt  Coz if it's not going to help I would like to know  I am going there with an open mind and still accepting that this will help me  I told my therapist not to put me on meds coz of the side effects  How is your experience with meds  That actually sounds like a neat experience  I sat home and spent NYE with family   and it was boring like every year  I think next year I might do what you did  This just totally     everybody's comments here have been incredibly validating and I genuinely feel comforted right now  I grew up with a mom who constantly yelled about anything and I was constantly treading on thin ice and trying to play it safe  She was the kind of person who would blow up completely at the smallest things  like forgetting to hang up my towel after a shower or getting a C on a quiz at school  I was constantly berated for being "lazy"  in addition to classes  i have 3 jobs and volunteer  and a "bitch"  I constantly make every effort to be as kind and sunshiny of a person as I can    Now I'm SUPER sensitive to anger and raised voices  the other day my roommate sent me an angry sounding text while I was at work  and instead of going home after work I was scared and stayed at a friend's house for the night  Another time  one of my sorority sisters yelled at me for something during recruitment  a super high stress time  and I ended up having a full blown  sobbing  hyperventilating panic attack in the kitchen    I thought something was wrong with me  so it's really nice knowing I'm not the only one  Awesome video  You did great    I loathe flying but love travelling  and I have to make myself do it because of overthinking sometimes  Got to see Maine and California this year  So worth it   Really makes me want to start planning another trip right now  Which one was your favourite  Taking drugs helps If you're straight  you're straight  Nothing wrong with it and no changing it  It's harmful for the bi community for you to say you are when you aren't  so just be whomever you truly feel you are and embrace it  Used to happen to me but then i discovered that it was caused by eating raw apples  especially fresh ones   You need a note from your doctor therapist about your anxiety  My school district got really strict the last year I was there and wanted documentation for absences  I loved DC the most  I loved the city and the museums and met some cool people   I really enjoyed Vancouver Whistler to Portland leg  It was fast paced and challenging and I went with just a backpack  No car  I enjoy being outdoors more and more  I hadn't really traveled much in almost a decade and didn't realize how much I just enjoy being outside  I absolutely relate  I refuse to allow myself to have certain thoughts  They come up and I literally just go "No  not anymore  I said I wasn't going to " and start thinking about every random thing under the sun until the thought it gone  Just don't latch on  you can't help what thoughts come into your head  but you can help which thoughts you dwell on  Thank you so much  Congratulations on your new life though  I hope you realize the power you have  Take baby steps  I went on one solo trip in 2015 and I was SOOO SCARED that it would be miserable and terrifying but it made me realize the power and control I've gained in my life over the years   NyQuil  Feel confident in the decision you have made  You made it for the right reasons and that's what's important  Good luck to you in the future  here's to a 2017 with a little less anxiety  i don't understand your point this is not a political post you are talking about a country i am talking about a small village called "bam"  i understand when you read my text is sounds bad but i was only talking about the neighbors and it was around 18 years ago i can't fit everything in one post  i am in the right category no   To me it feels similar to spacing out  but more physical  if that makes sense  When I "space out"  and am just not paying attention I still feel present  This feels different physically  I think what I've found that helps me over the last week or so is to be mindful of it and pull myself back  I can feel myself sort of drifting away and have to really be aware of it lately  I hope this passes for both of us  I've been getting into meditation and yoga and it helps me with mindfulness  which seems to help this weird feeling happen less and less   Yes  they will  It's a coping mechanism  It will help you to deal with the thoughts better  I don't want you to be afraid of what I am about to tell you  but the thoughts may never go away  Don't think that you are beyond help or dealing with it  however  There are people that have completely gotten over their thoughts  and bless them for it    What mindfulness will help you do is  instead of reacting in such an intense way to the thoughts  anxiety  depression  etc    it will lessen the pain around it  It's a way that teaches you not to resist the thoughts  as much as you want to  and just learn to let them go   It's more of a meditation thing  and like I said  it's really helped me  The Mindfulness Workbook for OCD is a good resource  There are some out there that focus more on the spiritual aspect of it  zen  buddhism  etc    but I find that this workbook really gets to the heart of it for people suffering from OCD  And if you're iffy about spiritualism or religion  don't worry  this workbook doesn't cover anything related to that    Dr  Jon Hirshfeld is the one who wrote it  and he works through the OCD Center in LA and Baltimore  Awesome  I can relate to most of them  Love Sloth and Snooze     If you can manage a couple long flights I'd suggest going to Europe   The flights right now to and from are pretty cheap   4 500 round trip from NYC  cheap from LA too   Then when you get there  trains are everywhere   You can up and go to Prague last minute for not too much and you don't have to worry about border crossings or dealing with airports  I can completely relate my health anxiety always consists of either throat or lung cancer issues  The only good thing to come out of it was it helped me to quit smoking but I still struggle daily  I'm even at the point some days of feeling even more anxious if I actually feel fine   Upvote for being honest about your situation  It's a tricky one for sure  but I don't know how to phrase my advice any other way than "if you love her  let her go"  Cut all contact from her if possible  At some point it's no longer love  and becomes a burden for both parties involved    As someone who has been on the receiving end of "obsessive love" with no intention of ever reciprocating it  it can be a dreadful and heavy burden  In my case  we started off as friends  but he became possessive and jealous over the smallest things even though he had no right to be  This obviously put a massive strain on our friendship  and I cut him out of my life because of all the anxiety I would get from being around him  It was suffocating  I miss the friendship a lot  but don't regret my decision    Hope this gives you a bit of perspective of the other side  so that maybe you can find closure for yourself too   I can 100  guarantee your friend didn't notice  That is such a small gesture  he probably if anything was worried about offending you if he brushed your chest  I have the opposite problem  any time I've ever handed ANYONE my dog  they've touched my tits  LOL  The knowledge that you understand what I'm describing is a huge thing to offer me  and I thank you for that  haha wow i had no idea anyone else felt the same way  Its true  it does seem kinda silly when I say it out loud I appreciate the advice for sure  I'm not really afraid to talk to him about it  though  I think the reason I haven't yet is because until I sat down and typed it out  I didn't really know how to describe it  I kinda wrote this more to see if anyone knew  like  why it's only brought on by climax   But thank you  More than likely  I'll talk to him soon and he'll be just as clueless as I am lol  This is pretty much what hasn't allowed me to escape the HA cycle of hell   I always seem to wake up with some kind of pain discomfort each morning  It can be my knee  I bumped it really hard back in October  or most usually throughout the day it is sternum rib neck spine pain  And very few things seem to take my mind off it  walking exercise helps sometimes and well getting drunk  but I've decided to lay of the booze cuz it isn't exactly the best coping mechanism    The thing is that getting pains troughout the day is normal for most people  I think that we are just hypersensitive to it  Talked to my mum today  she has chronic back pain  a pinched nerve which causes her not to feel one of her toes and even chest tightness and an upset stomach  this is purely psychological as she got some bad news recently   But she wakes up and goes about her day as usual and doesn't even complain about it  Aunt and cousin also have chronic back pain from sitting at a desk carrying a heavy child  Seems overwhelming but things will be A OK  IMO buspar is a sugar pill more than anything  Prozac is far more superior than buspar  What dose were you on when you tried Prozac   The starter dose is 20mg  I remember i started at 5mg and moved up 5mg every week and it curved any side effects I was having  Maybe try that   Can you relate to that gut feeling I'm talking about  Do you have any other ways to describe it  It's so new and bizarre to me    Oh yeah caffeine that late will guarantee an all nighter    I started on 20mg Prozac too  maybe I should ask my psychiatrist to try it again  I just feel bad that I was such a pussy and barely gave it a chance   Edit  Prozac  not buspar I didn't make it to the class  But I did some self care at home and sat in front of some roses my partner bought me and just meditated on their beauty   I was worried about the same thing two weeks ago  so much so that I felt an ER visit was worth it  I've had Bradycardia my whole life  so I thought that was the end  Turns out I have Sinus Node Arrhythmia  You're breathing speeds up and slows down when you inhale and exhale  It's very common  like I can't even explain in words how common this is  If your really concerned talk to your GP  Odds are you're gonna be fine  Most people have some form of irregularity  and most people never notice  Hope this helps   To be honest  the stomach pain might have been from anxiety  I had the same kind of pain this morning Yes and it could be pure adrenaline without you realizing it  That made me tear up  you're right  who doesn't feel exposed and vulnerable at climax  Thank you for your input  I really appreciate it   I have been to quite a few therapists in my life and have yet to find one that really gets what it's like in my brain on a daily basis  Do you know if there are  like  therapists that specialize in this kind of trauma  Admittedly  I've been putting my therapist off because she just doesn't click with me    I definitely will tell him after the vacation  I'm also meeting with a professional once every two weeks   I hope you'll get help as well  I know sometimes things feel bad af  but in the end everything's gonna be okay in one way or another     Let's stay strong  If you suffer from anxiety panic mystery chest pain is most likely due to hyperventilation  Chest pain and anxiety go hand in hand with each other  If it is anxiety panic related  it's more of a scary feeling than it being actually dangerous  If you feel a need to visit an ER then you should never second guess it but  if you're prone to anxiety panic   I'm willing to bet that's the cause of it  I hope you're gonna have the strength to stay next to your bf  All the best for you two  A nice short term solution and a terrible one longterm  I got really drunk on New Year's and then felt even worse the next day   I was asking myself the same question as the OP or a similar one  My current problem is more of a having trouble stopping focusing on physical aches and pains and discomfort  I am seeing a therapist in a few weeks  but would like to be better by then  I have already lost 3 months of my life to this and I want to stop feeling miserable   I don't have the answers  but I am going to try with the following   1  No googling researching symptom checking 2  Moving more   I try to get at least an hour of walking each day and want to get back into swimming and start with Pilates which might in turn improve my issues with back pain that played a huge part in setting oc my HA  though who knows what came first by this point  3  Spend more times with tasks that require full attention   lrarning languages  reading as well as performing household chores 4  Spending more time with people   friends and family  even if it is hard not to concentrate on this hellish HA when with then right now  it's bound to get better 5  The last but probably the most important one  I will try to accept that I will not get better overnight and won't just suddenly wake up feeling better next morning as if the last 3 months didn't happen  It requires work  Sucks that I have no patience in this regard  Heating pads are designed to handle heat  slim to zero chance it'll actually melt   unless you don't follow directions on how to use it  I use heat pads all the time for my neck when I'm under heavy loads of anxiety  If anything it works wonders  I'm sorry to hear that  Message me if you want to talk  Maybe it's time for professional help like cbt therapy  Good chance it can help  get you out of that funk   I'm sorry  Message me if you want to talk  Negative thought patterns are my biggest concern  I think about my illness 24 7  And I believe my mind is atrophied because of this unproductive thinking  My job is pizza delivery which unfortunately lets my mind wander and ruminate on stressors  I think the mind is like a muscle and we have to exercise its capabilities such as memory and problem solving  Its not enough to distract it with music or chores or tv  you need to push your brain into higher levels of thinking  Read a book  solve math problems  draw  play a video game  play sudoku  fix things  socialize     just do something that requires interaction and imagination  I think these activities promote healthy idle thought patterns   Talk to your doc about your medication either upping the dose or changing it  Dizziness can also be caused by hyperventilating  Loved the video and song   I would think if there was an abscess you would have gotten antibiotics when they did your x ray  I'm sure you'll be fine but you could always call your dentist or oral surgeon and ask their opinion   It so nice to see people have the same OCD rules as me    Thanks for sharing  I've been the same way  I'm either an all or nothing person  It's hard for me to comprehend someone not enjoying my company completely  I'm 32 and married and I still feel this way  But on the flip I also need my head space and need people to back off  It's selfish   But that's the issue  It's not so much them but us  We need to realize how we have relationships is not very healthy  If your doing the all or nothing thing  it's not a good thing  So it's less about getting over people and more about being comfortable with where things go in yourself  I actually got married at 21     You can call it a lot of things but I definitely don't consider it an accomplishment  Bad marriage  Stupid marriage  Young marriage  Aaah   You are lying   In another thread where you've posted this survey you say you need it for school  Your posts are full of grammatical errors and the survey is amateur   You say you don't want to offend anyone   You can start by being honest      I haven't really panicked lately  but I'm beginning to wonder if it's acid indigestion  Recently I've had very strong heartburn symptoms  burning sensation in chest and throat  and now I find myself burping a lot throughout the day as well as those tiny pinching pains in certain spots in my chest  I have no clue if this is the exact cause  but my anxiety isn't really helping it as I'm finding myself feeling more panicked the more it continues to happen   Granted  this is only day two  so this may be the beginning as things settle  I've been eating clean as of late  You can do it  Contrary to our anxious driven beliefs  hospitals are actually the best places for potential panic attacks because they have means to help calm you down professionally and caringly  Plus you can have all the TV you want  It won't be as bad as you think  Just go   you'll feel so much better if you do and you'll have peace of mind   better to be "safe than sorry"  Hope you recover quickly         Hugs OP     No pressure to of course  but please keep us posted if you can   You need to stop focusing on what ills you believe that your mother did does to you and focus on what you are doing to better yourself   You have to own your disease and own up in being responsible to combat it   It is unrealistic to think that your mother should let you live in her home without trying to push you into becoming an healthy adult   Some parents wouldn't even try to get their kids into some kind of mental health help   It may not have worked the way you wanted but at least her intentions were to try and help you    Instead of bashing your mom  grow up and take some positive control over in your life  Use your energy wisely  It's time to grow up    Sorry I meant 20mg of Prozac is the starter dose  You can try a lower dose and move up if needed  Could be I have stomach pains and issues all the time as well  Have a talk with your p doc and see what they recommend  I'm not a fan of buspar as it did nothing but give me dizzy spells for an hour or 2 after taking it   Yeah  I meant Prozac too  haha  I'm on 10mg buspar I messaged my psychiatrist  and I see him next week Oh yeah stomach issues heartburn  GERD etc can def cause "chest pain" when in fact is not chest but stomach pain  If the pain is around the heart area towards the bottom of the rib cage  Try some ginger root tea or anti acid like tums and see if that works  I sometimes drink carbonated mineral water with salt and lime  helps settle my stomach down almost instantly  Stomach issues and anxiety go hand in hand as well  the stomach is like a second brain in a way   Good to hear  10mg of buspar hasn't done anything for you  I actually took 30mg at one point and still didn't do anything lol I constantly have eye strain since I work in a dark room in a factory inspecting small pieces of plastic all day for small scratches etc  I also have astigmatism in one eye and mildly bad vision  my eyes give me headaches frequently and also have made me tired in the past  It's better to make a reasoned decision to improve things than to wait until it all crashes down around your ears and then have to pick up the pieces  Onwards and forwards  and good luck  I think it did a little at first  but I must have built a tolerance to it  It's 10mg 3 times a day  so I guess technically 30mg Right  I often wonder why my anxiety makes me so narcissistic  I have a song that I always go back to thats main chorus says 'maybe you're nothing at all'  It calms me down when I feel like the whole world is against me because it reminds me that I pay more attention and feel worse about myself and my actions than anyone else does     I went to the eye doctor a few weeks ago because my eyes had been aching  especially in dim places  and driving at night   He told me that he saw some irritation and that the pores in my eyelids were blocked and gave me some stuff to try to clean the stuff out  So far  it hasn't worked  I am thinking that the root of my problems could be eye strain and I don't know if that is true or if I should trust what the doctor said  Never in my life have a been so tired  My eyes are always so heavy and I have been having constant nagging headaches and nausea on occasion  I went to the movies last night and I could hardly keep my eyes open because they ached so bad  Any help   My father also passed away when I was younger from brain cancer so I am kind of freaking out that this could have something to do with that  even though people have told me I would be having seizures  which I haven't   r secondary survivors That's it exactly    The tricky thing is I still want to daydream  I just need to redirect my thoughts to more upbeat fantasies  I'm thinking that if I disrupt the worry train each time it starts moving  I can retrain my brain to wander more positively  Maybe doing something like reciting the multiplication tables whenever I notice my thoughts going bad  I try to keep learning and keep busy  but I need time to chill  too   Naw I took a full 30mg in the morning ha and still nothing  Do you wanna try something else   If you don't feel pressure like someone is sitting on your chest and if you don't have trouble breathing it's probably just anxiety or acid reflux  Still  going to the hospital could be good for you  at least for me when I'm anxious about something I'm less anxious about other things and could do things I'm usually afraid of  Find any comfortable spot  I use my bed and put a pillow on the wall to rest my back on  sit up in Indian style or whatever you're most comfortable sitting    Make sure the room is dark and the noise level is low   Close your eyes and relax your body  try not to think about anything   It's ok if you do  let the thought drift by  It's easy to meditate and you don't need to buy anything  you can also use music  without lyrics  good luck with your goals  Thank you for this  You are an amazing person  This means a lot to people suffering from anxiety  It is completely normal to imagine that there is someone there or to even hallucinate because during sleep paralysis your brain and body are not on the same page  which is why you suddenly feel panicked  Your brain actually releases chemicals to paralyze you while you sleep and when you wake up before that wears off is where that kind of night terror comes from  Although they are connected  PTSD and sleep paralysis   they can be worked through separately  I still struggle with nightmares from time to time  I have friends who also have PTSD and they do as well  but believe me when I say that it does go away slowly and YOU ARE NOT ALONE  Kay   Here are a few things that help me   1  Sensory pillows are a fucking lifesaver  Please please please buy one  The soft light when you need it right after a nightmare is so helpful  calming  and makes it just a little easier to go back to sleep   2  This is something I had to work on and it may sound weird  but videogames  They help significantly because it in a way is a sense of false reality  but you can alter it the gameplay itself  easier than you can in real life  obviously   This has been proven to give you more control during the actual nightmare itself by either being able to wake yourself easier or even completely change the dream at your will   3  Christmas lights  Me and all of my friends who also struggle have Christmas lights in our room  Sitting in a lower light environment before the actual darkness of sleep helps you to relax better before you drift off to sleep as well as set a calm and safe mood for if sleep didn't come so peacefully    Sorry I know I just wrote you a whole fucking book  but I hope it was at least helpful in some way  I am 25 now and have had PTSD since I was a child  It's fucking hard  I know  I really do  But don't give up  please  The world needs strong people and if you are able to get through whatever traumatized you in the first place  that must mean you're already strong  Reach out when you need it and remember that life goes both ways  I hope you have a happy life    Nathaniel Exactly  It's very hard to overcome ignoring it  I can even twitch    Wondering what type of OCD this falls under  I'll see what my psychiatrist recommends  He's off today Thank you and I hope anxiety becomes a past for you soon  I agree with everything you said  That teacher made the right move  The last thing anyone wants is a classroom full of kids getting a virus    I guess those who don't have this fear are more relaxed about it  Maybe thinking "oh well I'll get a day off school"  Personally I'd rather sit through hours of dental work than throw up  I would have jumped up and ran out of that room so fast  giving zero fucks  Unless  of course  there was vomit blocking the door   I used to be the same during PE  but then I didn't choose it as a subject anymore  school system is different in Australia   It is a compulsory class  If so  could you maybe talk to a school counsellor about how you feel  Anxiety alone sucks  but the fact that you're willing to cause serious injury to yourself  just so you can skip a class is pretty drastic  Like I can tell how much it bothers you because of the lengths you're willing to go to  Maybe you can get a doctor's note to say that you can sit out when you get too anxious  Just a suggestion  it might not work in your school system  but I thought I'd throw it out there anyway  Great video  I viewed your other videos as well and it is obvious that you have progressed much throughout your journey    It would be nice if you could make a video talking about how you were able to improve throughout the year   The views were beautiful but I can't even get on that freeway  Haha   Happy 2017   I know not everybody has OCD so these things aren't a big deal to people  and I envy those people   I did mention that I do understand this is 'normal' behavior  in my own words kinda  and I know she didn't do it on purpose  but she certainly didn't avoid doing anything twice  even when I mentioned to her how much it bothered me  Just wanted to vent about not being 'normal' and the stress this caused      Glad i'm not the only one  Sometimes it feels like I am  which is why reddit is great haha  She has to learn to control her emotions   This is not anxiety    For the last couple of weeks I've been waking up in the wee hours of the morning anxious and panicky about various things  and then can't get back to sleep because I can't break the cycle of negative thoughts  The last couple of nights I've been listening to ambient nature sounds while I sleep  and it's been helping quite a bit  When I wake up anxious  it gives me something concrete but unobtrusive to focus on instead of the anxious  negative thoughts and really helps with calming me down and letting fall back asleep again   It's not perfect  I still eventually wake up and can't get back to sleep because of anxiety  but I've been hitting that point maybe an hour hour and a half before my alarm goes off instead of four hours before  so it is progress  It also doesn't seem to help as much during the day when my mind starts to wander in that direction  but by then I'm usually in a better position to find something distracting like TV  video games  reading  podcasts  etc   Another option is the podcast Sleep With Me  which is basically just a guy reading a boring story to help you fall asleep  It's geared more toward insomniacs  but I think it could serve the same purpose of providing something to focus on instead of the negative thoughts  Hm    I believe I may just be spacing out a lot  Even still  I hope we both find ways to stay present  Meditation has really been a huge help through all of this  My physical symptoms have definitely abaded since I began meditating every day    Its the job of the father to discipline kids who are being bullies   It isn't your job  Nothing pathetic about it   I would also confide in a trusted teacher or school counselor  They have resources to help you and your family and there is often a liaison for the school district that is there solely to help families in tough times  I do feel it would be remiss of me to not say that a teacher or counselor may call CPS or the police to follow up on the abuse claims  However  this may help your Mom to realize the seriousness of the situation    Keep your head up and make sure neithe you or your siblings are alone in a room with him  Hey  I'm sorry you are going through this  ocd is an awful thing to go through especially when you recognise that you aren't acting rationally but still can't bring yourself to stop  have you sat down with your mum and asked her about what she feels might happen if she gets rid of the rubbish without cutting it up herself  She needs to come around to rational thought herself but you can prompt her with it  Because honestly they sound like unliveable situations for both of you but for her it's probably better than the thoughts of what will happen if she doesn't do it    I really hope this gets better for you and your mum   Everyone's experience is different  but you are definitely not alone     I'm not sure why I found the CBT to be so distressing  but I did   I think its probably related to my comfort level with some of the rituals       I don't necessarily feel like they all have to go in order for me to be "better" but I really just wanted them to be more under control   I had a tough time with the premise of the particular CBT  as well   "I just explained to you how difficult doing  or not doing  X is   and you want me to deliberately make myself uncomfortable "      Medication has been good for me   I'm at a point now where I still perform some limited rituals but it is an insignificant part of my life in terms of cost  i e   time  social response  etc    At your age 6 months of exercise will put you in the top 20  looks wise   I had an undiagnosed severe dust allergy and was always very sick missing a third of school days   In college I started playing basketball and decided to stop reveling in my sickness and ignore it     I started  r bodyweightfitness to get better at basketball and a year later I was running around shirtless and women were always touching me and flirting with me    Interesting  thanks  Worth a try    Anxiety is the uncontrolled stress response and thoughts   Its not the particular thing you think you are worrying about   if it isn't this it will be something else   If your sleep is disturbed this is a major health issue and you need to see a doctor  I would tell your boyfriend how you feel but I don't think it's reasonable to have him stop hanging out with his friends  If you really don't want to be around them than i would hope that your boyfriend would be understanding   I'm in the same boat  I've had  relatively mild  anxiety all my life and figured I had a good enough handle on it on my own  but the last couple weeks it spiked really badly and I haven't been dealing with it well   I have an appointment with a therapist next week  but it feels unbearably far away sometimes  Just hanging around here for a few days I found a couple of tricks to help me cope with it until then  and it feels like a godsend  I hope you have similar luck  You are in control in that you just have to stop feeding your anxiety and get off the computer   It does feel good to conquer an anxiety and you should always be aware of and address any anxiety that has progressed to a point where you are hurting yourself  Therapy is what helps OCD  If you feel comfortable talking with him her  then yes  I haven't  I'll try it  I had this wooden coaster on my bedside desk  I ended up just gripping that to keep me grounded to reality  It helped a lot   Hehe it started early for you  but anxiety really hits at major points in your life   End of high school and end of college are huge ones  I would suggest you change your frame though   it isn't the college that matters   What matters is the job and life    What do you want to do   Find people doing that and talk to them about it   Talk to business owners and learn about different jobs   Do internships now    If you get stuck on this it will be more productive   Yep  I've let it happen for minutes on end but it just stays  And it's too terrifying to let it happen any longer    If you learnt any coping mechanisms in therapy utilize them when you can  If not I'd possibly recommend contacting your GP   I fixed this by looking in the mirror and saying I love you for a year   I now never cringe when thinking back   I smile and love myself   I could not have been 'better' than what I was in the past   I'm sick and that is part of me   Who cares    You can also walk outside and smile at things   Spend time around other people and smile at them   Being positive around other people will cause them to be happier which will reflect back on you   Bake cookies for people  Etc  Your muscles get tense   This is the fight or flight response   Massage is one way to relax  I really want to know answer to this question as well  I heard that rationalizing would help  You can concentrate on doing your job better  As time passes I hope that you will get more comfortable about being around this guy  Also  are you sure that he is single   Same here  Thank you Nathaniel for taking the time to answer me  and for your kind words     This is the first time I have heard of sensory pillows  I looked them up and I will definitely be getting one now  I often call my cat over so I can pet and snuggle her after I wake up  and that helps  so I see how the pillow could be a lifesaver  The video game thing  that doesn't sound weird to me at all because I'm a gamer myself and have actually had dreams which got better after they took on a more "video game y" vibe  if that makes any sense  Like I have control over what happens instead of being along for the ride  I guess I'm not the only one  I will look into the light thing as well  My son has a very cool nightlight he no longer uses that I'll try putting on my bedside table  It has a very soft glow   Thanks again  It may sound silly but I feel a lot less alone than I did before I posted this  I read that and had the same reaction as you  I can't believe that people had to spell it out for them  Emetophobia or not  who wants to be in a room with vomit in it  Ugh  Thank you for your post  I agree that accepting anxiety rather than fighting it can help   If ovarian or cervical cancer runs in your family you can request a transvaginal ultrasound which would show immediately if there were any suspected problems  This in conjunction with a Pap smear will help rule out any cancers    You should be having regular exams and Pap smears to make sure everything is functioning as expected  this would help to lessen anxiety    These types of cancers run in my family so I have to have that ultrasound regularly  It's not fun but helps to immediately rule out some things    Hope this helps some   If you don't feel right about your current therapist  get another therapist  Hi ickycat  Thanks for your message   I've asked her this many many times over the years  She will barely acknowledge that there is a fear behind it   I think she is afraid of losing something  but I'm not sure that would be a strong enough reason to keep doing this    I do understand that living with whatever fear is causing this going around your mind must be awful  I'd just like to be able to see into it so I could try to help somehow  I can relate to pushing people away  But your story gives me hope      Yeah this doesn't sound like anxiety just sounds like a really high maintenance person  Ask her exactly how she feels when she's having these feelings  Does she feel like she's panicking or just angry because it sounds like she's just really picky about EVERYTHING and kind of a control freak  Talk to her about needing to control it because I don't think people get set off that frequently and with that many different triggers    Anxiety for me is all mental though so I dunmo take everything I say with a grain of salt  When I'm "triggered" is when I realize that some thing I havent done yet needs to get done  And I will dread doing it until it's done  Talking to my family is the worst trigger lol Aw  im so happy I was able to help   I'm sorry that these things happened to you  Regardless of your siblings mental health the trauma that you endured was real and has affected you  I agree with your partner that you should seriously consider opening up to your therapist about your sexual trauma  Addressing those early incidents of abuse could help to explain how you chose to cope and how your health has been affected   It's never easy to break the silence about traumatic experiences with someone  You might try writing what you want to say in a letter to your therapist and taking that with you to a session  The important thing is that you are ready to share this and that you feel comfortable talking with your therapist about it  If you feel judged or uneasy during your sessions  ask for a referral to another therapist  You will be more successful in healing and recovery if you feel safe with and supported by your therapist   Take good care of yourself  "I don't exactly have a lot of problems making friends or talking to girls"  This is not social anxiety  This is your basic high school crush  I went to see a therapist early last year because my boyfriend at the time threatened to break up with me if I didn't  That relationship didn't work out  I didn't make much progress and I moved too far away from my therapist to keep seeing her  It took me a few months after I moved to finally reach out after I had a panic attack in front of my current boyfriend and kept having uncontrollable crying  I had to wait a little over a month after that to finally get in to see a psychiatrist   As a 17 year old who loves to travel but gets anxiety flying  in crowds  in unfamiliar places  etc     thank you  I hope to have some similar experiences on my own one day   thanks for the inspiration   Keep killin it     I absolutely adored this  I also suffer from anxiety but sometimes am able to find freedom in visiting new places  though flying is very difficult for me   So happy to see below that my hometown of D C  welcomed you with open arms   Same thing happen to me I think it took 2 and half months before I actually got to see a therapist  Depending on the time year determines how long you wait I think   I don't believe that you are being over sensitive  It sounds to me like your grandmother was not at all sensitive towards you if you were often hearing his voice on the phone over the years   I suggest that you talk to your grandmother about this when she brings up his name in conversation  Yes  she has fond memories of him but he did abuse you and caused your health to suffer  She should be made aware that you would prefer not to hear about him  If his name comes up occasionally that's different  Certainly she can recall fond memories while you are not visiting with her   If she puts any blame on you for her partner's criminal behavior or refuses to consider your feelings  then you might seriously consider spending less time with your grandmother   You might also consider talking with a trauma therapist in order to gain support and validation   Take good care of yourself  They are supposed to be supportive and helpful  a good therapist shouldn't negate your feelings  Your feelings exactly why you want someone to talk to   I see one for anxiety  and we spend most of the time talking about what's made me anxious since the last time we talked  and how to feel a little less anxious in the future  You're probably your harshest critic  so if the therapist ever says something along the lines of "you're wrong " they're probably telling you the feelings you have ARE normal and valid  That's possibly the best part of seeing a therapist  you get someone in your life that validates your feelings  and helps you deal with them  Thanks for posting     Legally moving out    I'm under the age of 16 so I cannot legally move out yet   Probably untrue   You can probably legally move in with a grandparent  cousin  aunt  uncle  or other relative   You might also be able to legally move in with a friend   Finally  you might also be able to legally move into a domestic violence shelter   But it might be helpful to your youngest sister if you stayed with her instead of moving away from her     Money    If my father were to be imprisoned  or die  I know for a fact that my mother would not be able to support our family on her income  which makes me sick to my stomach and nervous for the future   If your mom can't afford to pay her rent or mortgage  you guys may eventually have to move to a smaller place  or you may have to move in with relatives   This may be majorly disruptive but is not the end of the world   Peanut butter and jam sandwiches are kind of boring but pretty cheap   Try every flavor of jam   If money's really tight  omit the jam   If your mom can't afford any food at all  you can visit food banks and get free food there   Or you can visit drop in centers  soup kitchens  and eat free meals   Food is plentiful in America     Your father    he attempted suicide the day after admitting this to my mother but failed  He might be in severe depression   I think it would be good if he could survive the depression  maybe he can get better   He should first visit a doctor or hospital and get help with the depression   He can go to Sex Addicts Anonymous or a sex addiction therapist later on     Some questions    I don't know how this could end or what to do  A   Have you yet visited the  prefs panel  https   www reddit com prefs   and enabled "Send messages as emails" for this throwaway   B   Does your youngest sister ever sleep in a room by herself  Hey girl  Its really sound like youre going to need therapy and possibly some medication for anxiety  Have you talked to your parents about either of those things   Im sending you my positive vibes  3 What happened to your marriage if you don't mind me asking   On behalf of other couples who married young  Who would like to stay married and learn from other couples   Could the police put him in jail for "break and enter" or for "assault and battery" even if she asks the police not to   Would they   It seems to me that it would be unwise for any police to allow any axe wielding meth addicts to roam free  It's been a long time since I have been in high school but I used to be able to sit on the sidelines and do my homework during PE  As long as they saw I was being productive  no one cared  and I still got a passing grade in PE all of the years of my high school career using it as a study hall  Definitely talk to a counselor about your options   You are doing the right thing by looking for and seeing a therapist  Finding one that works for you can be difficult and you'll need to keep seeing people until you find someone you can work with   When finding a therapist look for one that specializes in trauma  PTSD and EMDR  A good therapist will need to work with you over several years  not just a couple months   If you feel the need to medicate yourself please see a psychiatrist  Drugs like MDMA are probably not helping you given your state of mind    If you cannot find help there are some excellent books and websites about PTSD and trauma  I'm reading Healing Trauma by Peter Levine right now  Very good but challenging    Finally  find others you can talk to about this  Posting here is a good way to start  Maybe there's a PTSD support group in your city  The more you know about the illness the better      That's better than what I did  I went to bed at around 9pm I'm very sorry that you are receiving such disturbing messages  I am glad that you brought this to our attention and suggest that you block those users who have sent you upsetting and or threatening messages   Unfortunately  the only way I know to protect this sub is to make it a closed community  By doing that  we couldn't support as many people as we are able to currently   I hope that you get further advice from supportive members here  Take care  Suicidal thoughts increased for a long span of time  self harm actions increased  and I developed a new symptom of anxiety  a tic which was hurting my muscles  making me sore  and made me feel like a freak   The medicine I'm on now has helped loads and it was easy to obtain  I'm so much happier now  I love calling a cab  normally the driver is really nice and we have an entertaining conversation    Hope you find your girl and cheers    So  I'm still not good at this  but my best advice is to see anyone as a person first  and attractive second   Everyone  even beautiful people  have flaws  and they're own inner monologue  and self doubts  and pretty much anything else that hits at your confidence  They also do most the same things we all do  which means they've had bad days and embarrassing moments too  And  most of them have normal hobbies and interests that we mere mortals also enjoy  Humanizing them should make it easier to connect with them  They're just people  even if they're also living Greek statues   Again  this is something I still struggle with  but I think most of the anxiety people get from being around attractive people is caused by putting them on some pedastal  We're all just people  and we all deal with same shit  Greetings  It sounds like this was a difficult thing for you to write but I think it's really good you're opening up and discussing it  I have a lot of sympathy for folks whose parents had these issues  as my mother  too  had a bit of a hoarding problem  It wasn't quite as bad as some of the extreme cases you see on tv  and it sounds like it wasn't as bad as you're currently experiencing  but even that was quite hard to live with  So I can empathize  and I know how frustrating it is to have to live in clutter when you're a naturally tidy person  I find it literally jams up my thinking   like  I find it harder to concentrate in a messy room with too much visually going on  It can be a real pain in the ass   I think it's important to say two particular things  1  Hoarding  strictly  this problem is usually classified as Hoarding Disorder rather than OCD  though the two are closely linked  is a curable and fixable disorder    2    but not by 'reasoning' or 'logic' ing your mother out of it  If that makes any sense   The problem with stuff like hoarding  or any other addiction  obsession or phobia  is that it's not really caused by having the wrong rational thoughts as such  People don't ACTUALLY believe that losing all their money on a gambling addiction  filling the entire house up with garbage  washing their hands fifty times or running away screaming from a harmless spider are logically clever ideas  Folks with these problems aren't delusional  I'm sure your mother isn't either  However  there's something going in with the more subconscious parts of the brain  the bits that deal with primitive fears and raw emotions  that's skewing someone's perception to make them end up in these situations  And often their brains are literally wired differently or temporarily slightly damaged   this article explaining how hoarder's brains are actually different to regular folks' in brain scans  might be useful to you    https   blogs scientificamerican com observations scans of hoarders brains reveal why they never de clutter      But the problem IS fixable  with proper therapy and support  Your mother isn't stuck like this  Brains are very changeable  if you do the right therapy  and you can learn to think and feel differently  at any age     It would really be a good idea to sit your mother down and tell her that you think a doctor or therapist could help her to feel better about her possessions  and try to get her to see one  It can be tough with hoarders  because they're in one of the categories of disorders where they often don't think they have a problem  But she sounds like a really caring person  hoarding disorder sufferers often are  and if you made it clear to her that it would really mean a lot to you if she could try and learn some techniques to deal with her possessions differently    It's probably best not to frame it as an organization problem  one that just needs a forcible decluttering and a big investment in new storage units  because that's probably not the heart of the problem  Like  the problem is psychological  There will be some underlying reason why she feels the need to cut everything into little pieces before it goes and why to her  it feels scary and distressing to throw away an object  Her feelings are very real  so I guess even though I understand it's a pain in the ass  t least you know it's not something she's doing to you deliberately  you know   There's some info you might find handy on the HoardingUK site   http   hoardinguk org   Or the Help for Hoarders charity association  who can help you find support and therapy for your mother  plus it's got dedicated hoarding forums so you can talk to other people in your situation  so at least you won't feel too alone   http   www helpforhoarders co uk    The charity OCD  UK can also help you with hoarding problems  since it's such a closely related disorder to OCD  if those other two don't turn out useful  http   www ocduk org hoarding    I wish you all the best in getting your relative some help with this  Grit your teeth and hang in there  and see if you can convince her to get some support for this mental health difficulty  Hopefully she can feel better and not let clutter get in the way of her life again      This is weirdly similar to my 2017 goals  Thanks for sharing  I have a tic where my head will jerk in a random direction  Sometimes you can hear my neck pop  "Crack " I take medicine now and it's been significantly reduced  It was bothering me so much I just wanted to cry Why even reply to this guy's post if you're going to be this way about it  What positive thing that actually benefits your life do you get out of it  I did  This was over a month ago and I've been long done with the antibiotics  I have that too  I have had lots of experience with emotional abuse though  lol so true that video was great  it completely lifted my day  thank you  its so great that you did that  i'm proud of you     It sounds like you are experiencing pretty bad PTSD from what happened   You're right  your parents shouldn't have handled it as a drinking issue  because it was clearly a rape    I think therapy is still the best way to handle PTSD   that's how I eventually was able to deal with mine   You can go to a therapist who has a specialization in sexual trauma  which I did after my first therapist was not really able to understand my situation   My second therapist was a woman  easier for me to trust since I had been attacked by a man  and secondly was a "women's issues and family" therapist  so she was familiar with eating disorders and sexual abuse  which was helpful to me   In terms of dealing with the PTSD  it might be that the other poster is right and you need some anxiety medication  but that would be for you and your therapist to figure out together   I personally also did a gentle  patient led therapy called  EMDR  https   en wikipedia org wiki Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing  which was eventually able to help me really cut out the nightmares and panic attacks  There are many different types of journaling  many of which are   scientifically backed   beneficial  I've tried a few  and some stuck  Two of which I'll probably do for the rest of my life because I just feel so much better doing it   I don't generally write when I'm anxious  not that I really get that anxious anymore  Thankfully  But I'm still sticking with it anyway  The only time I journaled while anxious was when I was having intrusive thoughts  which have passed now  There it's very beneficial to write down what's going on in your mind at the time  and read them again when you're back to your "normal" self  And then you'll realize just how irrational and silly those thoughts actually are  I realized that myself while talking to a therapist  and then replicated that with journaling and it pretty much gave the same effect  Over time   also by not judging my thoughts  the intrusive thoughts went away   The two types of journaling I do are     Daily gratitude journaling  Every day  most days  at least  I'll write down 10 things I was greatful for during the day  Both big and small  It's been shown that by doing that you are physically training your brain to look for positive things in life  Pretty much the opposite of anxiety depression  which trains your brain to be more negative  I really love the science behind these things  since it takes it out of the touchy feely mumbo jumbo world      that's just what works for me     "Regular" journaling  If something bothers me during the week  or I find myself thinking a lot about something repeatedly  I will write down a quick note to remind myself to go in depth on it when I have the time   Then when I have an hour or so  I'll just start writing about that subject  and see where it leads me  I find it does the same as a therapist  You are bascially making connections you previously weren't aware of  and are bringing subconcious noise to the surface  Once you write untill you don't have anything to write about anymore on that subject  you can move on  and in my experience it will have cleared mental bandwidth  It seems to have to do with your brain not having the chance to really figure something out  because we all live in this fast paced world with so many distractions  That's not how we evolved  Now we have to make time for deep thought  and get it all out of our systems   It may not feel as productive in the moment because you are calm  but afterwards you might often feel a sense of relief and weight off your shoulders  Works for me  But again  there are many different types that may or may not work for everyone  Good luck  Judging your obsessions as unique is actually a very common compulsion  There are people posting on here all of the time about the fear of having some disease or disorder  There's no difference between somebody that's engaging in compulsions for reassurance about schizophrenia  or autism  or HIV    This is why it's useful to keep the focus on compulsions and actions  You're reacting to uncertainty with compulsions  The superficial topic of the uncertainty is irrelevant  You could be worried about turning into a llama and it would still be the exact same problem  The way over it would also still be the same   Enjoy the normalness of these compulsions  I want to find a job  but i'm afraid that i won't be able to be so close to people in the open space office  I mean it's too close  less then 0 5m between people  Thank you for the reply  I will definitely check out rainn  i really just want all this to be over  Hey  Awesome vid and really uplifting  I'm going through something similar  if this isn't too personal of a question how did you let get yourself our of that feeling   being stuck inside yourself I mean  Although maybe the answer is different for everyone Hey girl  fellow female HOCD sufferer here  Your story strikes me a lot because it's very  VERY similar to mine   I'm convinced that if you don't show signs of attraction to the same sex realy early on  like  around the time you start  getting crushes   chances are you're not really gay bi   I have a gay guy friend that when we were on high school told me he was bi  he said he always knew he liked guys and had several crushes on boys before highschool    nowadays he realizes he thought girls were pretty but what he felt deep inside he liked for real was guys   he was only using the 'bi' identification because he was very insecure about how people would take it he was gay  Much like an anchor to the 'straight' world    I also have a girl friend who was a lesbian in denial for the most part of her life because her family is homophobic as fuck  From a very early age she'd look up lesbian porn and be super aroused by it   even before highschool  What was interesting is not that she was homophobic towards lesbians   she actually always thought they were fine    she was always homophobic towards feminine men   Now  a second girl friend of mine that identifies as 'bi' told me she'd always thought girls were attractive from a very young age  She'd got crushes on girls more than she got on boys  Nowadays she's in a relationship with a guy  but she swears to god she's way more into girls   What I'm saying is that    Sexual orientation is something that comes with us from birth  If it was part of you that you were anything but straight  you wouldn't feel so anxious about it  If you were lesbian or bi in denial  you'd LOVE to crush on girls and feel super good about it  but wouldn't want anyone knowing that  The problem would be the outside world interefering with your inside world and not the other way around   Hope this helps   Hasn't it actually been proven that "positive thinking" or rather the forcing of oneself to do so has the opposite effect   I don't know you personally so I can't really judge  but based on my own experiences it's often hard to notice change because it's so slow  For example  at some point I just realized I hadn't had any terrifying intrusive thoughts or panic attacks for a couple of months  And those were big  noticeable things  If I didn't even notice not experiencing those big things anymore  is it really a surprise I didn't notice the small changes either       I just look back at how I was more than a year ago  and there's no denying my life has changed dramatically  But I still think I feel like the same guy  but I clearly don't  In the same respect I still think I'm the same guy I was 18 years ago  I don't notice any change  But if I really think about it  33 year old me and 18 year old me are different dudes entirely  D  Perhaps you could reflect on that  It may be that you havn't benefited from it  and there are lot's of different anti anxiety techniques out there from meditation to journaling   journaling alone has many different ones with different focuses  But it also may be that like me  you just havn't noticed the change  Do you still feels as shitty have the same problems as you did the first time you visited a therapist  Ha  thankfully all the coffee is free  Working at a hospital has its perks  University is a massive transition for anyone but when you have anxiety it can be that much worse  Congrats on returning this semester and remember to take it one day at a time  If it takes a little longer to graduate it is okay  your mental health is more important  We've found these tips are really useful whether you're new to university or transitioning back  http   blog tranqool com 2016 09 16 managing the transition to university life  Have you tried sleeping medicines  melatonin pills  or anxiety medication benzos  Hang in there mate  hope things get better Good for you  school isn't for everyone but it can be really hard to find your own path  Sometimes family doesn't really get it but these tips may help you tackle their questions  http   blog tranqool com 2016 12 20 questions at family dinner  I had surgery for some abscessed teeth  lower front  that kept filling my chin with puss  The surgery was unpleasant but it fixed the problem and I'm fine now  Don't worry  Go get the diagnosis and treatment you need   Faithfulhumanity really hit the nail on the head here  but all I can offer is that after 12 hours  if you haven't started showing symptoms  you've probably dodged the bullet  However  if you're certain it's going to happen  because this anxiety disorder doesn't give a living shit about logic  then the best you can do is prep to make yourself as comfortable as possible through the ordeal   Go to the store  get ginger ale  some fruit  canteloupe was the only thing I could keep down last time I had food poisoning  and some crackers  Maybe some pepto  but I feel like pepto's really never done shit for me during these instances  Ginger tea is good to have on hand  too  If you catch it  at least the ginger can fight the nausea  Ginger won't do a whole lot for the diarrhea  but let's be honest  we'd all rather have nonstop diarrhea for a few days than any instance of nausea v  whatsoever    You'll likely be okay now  no use dwelling on  "oh shit did I eat without washing my hands   did I touch my mouth   etc" because it's likely with all the chemicals you hand on hand at the time  you'll be okay  you probably sanitized everything before there was much chance of contamination  But prepping for the worst case scenario while you're still able bodied is about the only thing you can do in the case that you did get contaminated   But again  I don't think you have anything to worry about over twelve hours later  Noro sets in really quick as far as I recall  Also  it's worth noting that a LOT of people will literally only get diarrhea  it's more children  elderly  and compromised immune systems that get nausea and worse  If you haven't been sick in 12 years  you're probably in the "mildly immune to things that make everyone else throw up" category  for what it's worth   Also  a fun facttype B and AB blood groups are inherently immune to more gastrointestinal viruses than O and A types  So that's a thing    And again  also  it's more likely that the people who were on the bus had food poisoning from poor sanitary conditions and given they were living in such cramped spaces  they caught it from one another from the "mist" effect Faithfulhumanity mentioned re  fluids   You're likely alright  friend      But if anxiety says you're certainly doomed  then prep your emergency ginger stash and everything else that'll make the experience as smooth as possible  Hi  I hope you are doing okay   I am sorry that driving makes you  anxious  after reading your post I can understand why you developed a very real and legitimate fear centered around  driving   You mentioned that your stuck hitching rides from her to get your kids to school  Can you call an Uber  Lyft  or  taxi  to get the kids to and from  school  I  could see this getting expensive   but look into the cost    Ubber  and Lyft can be cheap  If  it's too expensive maybe you can contact a charitable  local church and explain that you are without a car and sincerely need a ride  Even if you are not religious and dislike your local churches I could see them being a resource  Talk to your schools transportation and set it up to have your kids bused to and from school  Talk to a third party  like your kids pediatrician or another source and ask for resources which would provide you with safe ride options to And from school  Don't give up  I'm just trying to think about options which would free you from ever having to be in the car with her again   I often get blurry eyes and double vision  especially late in the day  Been thoroughly checked out by eye doctor and neurologist and they couldn't find anything wrong with me   I'm like this also  except the friend I became too close to is also a sufferer of anxiety and depression  and self harms  It's gotten to the point yesterday where they blamed their cutting on me and said I drive them to be more depressed because of how I am and how I speak to them  I've been so close to this friend over the years and now I feel desolate that they don't want me anymore  Yet in my rational part of my brain I also know I shouldn't need this particular one person to be happy  It's a horrible situation  Thanks for the suggestion If you had an abscess  it would probably be seeping  which you could definitely taste       Infections get pretty gnarly pretty fast  and you'd know it  inflammation  pain  seeping  foulness   To prevent an infection until your appointment  rinse your mouth after every meal with either salt water  diluted hydrogen peroxide  or something like Listerine  Thank you for you comment  I really appreciate it  I do not have any grandparents  aunts  or uncles  And I would really prefer to keep my friends out of this   I do believe my father is seeking help  however I do not know how or from who   Your questions  A  I have not  and would not plan to  I think that this account is as public as my situation will get  atleast hopefully   B  my little sister does not sleep alone  she sleeps with my two older sisters  Well  a clean EKG is a very good sign  However  it only records what is happening while it's recording  and it is possible to have intermittent arrhythmias which only occur occasionally  I e  Not when you're at the doctor's office   Luckily these are usually not dangerous  If your doctor has any reason to suspect a problem  they might give you a holter monitor to continuously record EKG for 24 hours    Fwiw  I often have an awareness of my heartbeat and it feels like it's doing weird things  I haven't done a Holter but I was thoroughly examined by a cardiologist who said don't worry about it    Also  if it's true vertigo  it's likely caused by vestibular stuff  and isn't really a big deal    ask your doctor if they'd recommend a vestibular evaluation     Hey  I'm an uber driver too  It really is exactly as you described  I was nervous at first  but now i'm kind of addicted   I didn't drive for NYE though  I was at home helping a new pet settle in my home  only you know the answer  if those friends are bad friends so thats something you can know if you think about it  because maybe there is another reason they are your friends  like use you or hanging out with you because they dont have someone else  if you have at least 1 good friend  you can talk to him about that in a way that wont revreal entirely your problem  my eyes are really sensitive at night too  I think it's just a common thing  and I'll do things like dim my mirror to help manage with it  I also get eye strain if I haven't seen natural light enough in one day  weirdly enough   so I try to go look out a window every now and then  I think you'll be fine and you should trust the eye doctor  it's likely you're just worrying so much it is wearing you down  So do you think people  who dont know you at all are better judgement than your psychiatrist  i dont think so  see another psychiatrist to get second opinion or just accept what he is saying   it happens to met too when someone laugh or saying something bad and i think it's about me  i even remember particular stories that i found out it wasn't true and thats all in my mind  i don't have paranoia  You say you give lessons to a group of people one thing you could try to do is focus and look more at the rest of the people not in an impolite way towards him obviously but try not to focus too much on him because it distracts you and makes your thoughts go crazy   Second of all try to not see him in a sexual romantic way just look at the dude like he's your friend or a normal random person on the street that you make short talk with   The fact that you're being attracted to him makes you have certain expectations of him in your head like being with him a kiss date anything  therefore causing you to be awkward and shy because you want to look good in his eyes Try to not stress it too much and see him as just "a guy"  What I tell myself when I start freaking out about something is that yes  we're all going to die  and there's very little we can do to change the where and when  But  the little we can do is very important  and that is stay on top of our health and habits and create the best conditions possible for optimal survival   You are accomplishing this by getting your first pap  It is highly unlikely that you'll be a statistical outlier and 'win' the big C  indeed  most of us at your age are dealing with the fears of a sti   From here on out  stay current with your healthcare and you can be reassured that it's far less likely that you'll be one of those people caught entirely unaware by a major health issue   It's also important to realize that some of your response is you processing the trauma happening to your cousin  So  it's okay that you're crying and upset  It's still a form of grief  even though you have every reason to believe things will be okay for her  Best wishes   Thanks  I know seeking reassurance just kinda strenghtens my anxiety   it feels like it helps but in reality it doesn't   Thanks for the advice  also it feels good knowing someone deals with the same type of thoughts  I try to dissociate myself from my thoughts  I know I am not these intrusive thoughts  but the images that come to my head  knowing I don't believe in them  is enough to sicken me  Sometimes it just makes me question myself and my morals entirely  y'know   Hmm  Idk how old you are  but if you're over 21  and live in the US  maybe try a little bit of Indica marijuana before sleep  There are some strains designed to help you sleep or be less anxious and or depressed  If you're of age and willing  try that  But make sure you do it with a sitter around the furst few times and don't do too much or too often  It can easily form into an addiction  especially if youre self medicating often  so watch out to not get hooked  Yeah I've learned to kinda just let the thoughts come  don't push them away because it actually makes them stronger  Sometimes it works  sometimes the thoughts are so disgusting that I physically can't allow myself to just let them come and not try to push them away   Haha I know I'm not a pedophile  but my thought is constantly "What if "  I always question my morals and myself  It's horrible Respect  good on ya   im travelling currently on my own and i suffer from anxiety  can be tricky at times but glad i packed my bag   Do you think no one in your position never did the change and became happy with his life  not even one person  why couldn't it be you    Be positive  think good about yourself  by the way you are writing and what you are saying i can see you are smart  you also said to the readers to "forgive you if its hard to read" it means you are nice person and considerate  i bet you have more good qualities that people can appreciate  people made it out of rock bottom and you can do it too  read about positive thinking and other issues you think you might have and you will see the change  it may take time and it will be hard  but it worth it  You're very thoughtful  thank you so much for taking the time to write this    it really helps  and it does make sense  I try also to do that  but usually the thought is still there  cus deep down I still kinda focus on that thought  I guess I just need to calm down and not latch on  Thanks for the advice   I've been thinking about doing that on the weekends  or nights where there is nothing going on   Seeing people being happy esppecially groups of young couples who have absolutely no inhibitions has always been a major trigger for ne   It always reminds me of something i never had over the course of 35 years and there they are  living it up in their 20s surrounded by friends   It sounds like a great opportunity to get comfortable around people   Better jump on it before automated cars replace drivers and the ship sails    Yeah that's OCD lol  You just have to remind yourself that it's your OCD talking  not you  And OCD tells  lies  I think you have every right to feel the way you do and you are not being over sensitive about this   Your grandmother needs to understand how uncomfortable brining him up is making you  She is allowed to feel how she feels about him but she needs to be aware of how this affects you when you are in her presence  Maybe she is downplaying the fact that a man she cared for could actually have hurt you so much  For a lot of people denial continues even after someone close to them was found guilty  I agree that maybe you should mention how you feel when she next brings him up   Stay strong x Hello  I have been on Sertraline  Zoloft  for a little over a month  and it has not seemed to help  I feel that my panic attacks are happening more frequently and they are harder to control  Maybe this means Sertraline is not for me   Also  if anyone has any knowledge of this please help   About a year and a half ago  I ate an edible  medical  and it was about 50mg  I had a really bad high  over a day  and was convinced I was dying  Ever since then I have had really bad anxiety panic  Could that be what triggered it   I feel that I have PTSD from that experience  I know that sounds crazy  but every time I have gotten high since then it has not been a great experience because I start to panic like I did that one time  And just yesterday I was thinking about how I feel when I am really high  I hate it  and I had a panic attack while driving  Driving makes it so much worse   Thank you  Is that an everyday thing  I haven't had a problem with my vision at all  The doctor said my vision is fine  My eyes just ache all the time  I also kicked out of highschool and didn't do anything special for few years  i was sitting all day infront of my computer until something happened and changed that  it doesn't really matter what what was that thing  but it was very very hard  its like i've been forced to face my fears and leave my comfort zone    you can find that thing too  dont waste time  choose a target and everyday you live  live for that target  lose weight  go to see a doctor about that sweating  my brother had something similar and he got a skin cream that eventually he didn't need anymore   read articles to self improve and above all   thank your mother or any other person that helped you in these hard times  you have no idea how happy it will make them  and how you will appreciate yourself   if you hit rock bottom  the only way is up    It has gotten worse since I've been worrying so much about it  If I was confident that what the doctor told me was going to help then I don't think I would be worried so much  Yesterday i was buying paint from a really friendly guy at the paint department and i was absolutely wigging out   The day before our conversation went so smoothly and it was just a pleasant interaction  But this time I felt so incredibly awkward and thought he must realize i'm retarded and i ended up ending up wallking away with my head down   I mean all i was doing was buying paint  imagine trying to approach a girl or make friends   Not knowing how we'll feel one day to the next really throws a wrench into forming relationships because we set expectations that we don't feel we can meet the next time we see the person     No matter how many people there are online thete is no replacement for human interactions or intimacy   Finding situations groups where we can participate that don't absolutely demand we be social with people around us are great   Bowling is a good one   Just do everything you can to go out of your way to move your jaw around actual people   At the end of the day the good bad news is nobody really cares    Hey man i feel you i do have a lot of regrets about the past and high school as well but i try not to think about them too much because the past is the past and you can't change it that's the most important thing that you have to remember You know what i do Instead of focusing on the regrets i chose to remember and think about the positive stuff that i did and it does give me a small amount of joy   I say that you still have time to do the things that you didn't get to do in HS like sleepovers and having drinks with your friends As a uni freshman you're still young and still have those opportunities  I don't have any wild crazy funny stories from HS mostly because i had a very small group of friends and i would only see one of them outside HS frequently but we never did anything "extreme" except sleep overs and sharing retarded stories I didn't even go to prom but i'm not worries about that i can still go to the uni prom when i graduate   The most majority of people won't be interested in pursuing you in anything if you don't "put yourself out there" even if they like you at first hand it's some kind of a "vibe" that you send to them subconsciously that you're a more private person or wanting a deeper connection I get you Have the same issue  But i do consider that as long as you still have some friends that you trust it's all good You can have fun with a small amount of people you can have drinks with your mates you don't need a huge ass party that you might not even be sure that you'd enjoy afterall   My advice to you is this try focusing on improving yourself and better times will come Also i would recommend you ASMR search on youtube  might help you with the sleeping problem YT is full of useful videos to keep the bad thoughts away hell watch a funny video that will make you smile it does help i have done it myself When you get to bed remember the good things that you did leave the regrets out because there's no point really       Take care man  Yea these are beautiful  I love all of them but the last one I made my desktop  Does she have more  Yep I have it every day though not always all day and some days are worse than others    my eyes don't ache though  so I guess we don't have the same problem   p This is a horrible feeling  "being sensitive"  It immediately invokes that flight or fight response and instead I well up with tears immediately    My ex was angry and emotionally loud and violent  He would get mad and lash out at thing  breaking them and slamming stuff  He would yell and I had no other response but to cry and stammer out something  It made him more mad  He didn't understand why I couldn't deal with it even if it wasn't directed towards me    Just like some of us are more introverted and quiet  some can't deal with those crazy  negative emotions running around wreaking havoc on us  I refuse to be with someone like that again  It was a scary time for both of us  I hope it gets better for you soon xo Well  lung cancer is extremely unlikely because you're young and not a smoker     also  anxiety can cause feelings of trouble breathing  It's probably best to trust your doctor  though you can always see another doctor for a second opinion if you're not satisfied with the first  That will hopefully give you more reassurance than Dr  Google   p  You could insist on fancy scans of your lungs  but it is probably best to trust your doctor's judgment about whether that's necessary    just ask him her directly if they think it would be a good idea  Never just you  Have you spoken to your roommate about that happened  I usually try to diffuse the situation by ignoring it and never wanting to talk about it again  but it's bad conflict management  You can do it  I've had social and general anxiety for about 10 years now  I got into a relationship I really believe is amazing  I'm really just done with anxiety ruining things  controlling my life  or causing me to detach from people  I wanted to get better for myself  my SO  and the future    It's never too late to start or start over  It's been 6 months  and I'm improving everyday   therapist classes etc  How do you travel without being rich    Not being snarky btw  just wondering if you have some frugal travel tips  Thanks for the reply   also does the symptoms I listed sound like bronchitis  Thank you  You're completely right     There are no limits to what our own minds can do  I am just starting to realize that everything I think  I attract and I can choose to change path I walk    Keep sharing the amazing things you do  When you inspire one it tends to have a trickle effect  Thank you again       It worked out  There was a big misunderstanding and even though I never brought it up to him  when I got home he apologized for blaming me and then we went to see Rogue One together  So things smoothed over  I really do hate confrontation though and will do everything to avoid it   Guided meditation  YouTube  SoundCloud  Spotify  Google Music  etc have playlists specifically suited for you and your partner   Omg I've been getting the same thing  The past fewdays I stopped taking Xanax  1mg a day self medicating for a couple months  and when I lay down at night I feel exactly the way you described  I feel  waves of panic rushing through my heart whenever I reach that point where u start to fall asleep  All I know is I will never take Xanax again  Yea when you're on it  it works but  it's only been a couple months and I'm tired of sliding the problem under the rug    The withdrawal is what's making me never want to take them again  I never knew quitting benzos would be so detrimental to my health  It's already been almost 96 hours since I've last taken it  and people I should feel much better in a couple days  I just want to say I was near giving up because I couldn't sleep  shaking  cold hands  sweaty feet  no appetite all week  It's horrible but worth it  I know quitting benzos cold turkey isn't very smart  but I was only on it for a couple months and didn't take it everyday  So the withdrawal didn't start till after 2 days or so  Stay up and keep pushing  We're all in this together   It's more dangerous to feel safe at home than to feel terrified around people  Not the OP  but there's a surprising amount of things you can do with little money  Most state parks are either free or less than  5 for a car full of people  There's also tons of museums out there that operate on a donation basis  Every city has small hole in the wall restaurants and diners where good food is usually a plenty    As far as actually getting to these locations  that might be where you have little options  Gas for a car  bus fare  or a plane ticket isn't exactly cheap  But if you plan far enough ahead and know how much you have to save up  you can put aside a little money here and there  Good trips don't have to be far away either  I'm sure there are interesting places and cities within an hour of you  you just have to keep a look out   I was having stomach problems from anxiety  I have IBS  but I didn't know it at the time  I also got nauseas a lot  The gut issues lead to me developing further anxiety about the food I eat  and at one point I had anxiety attacks whenever I ate food at restaurants or even at home  The anxiety just made my IBS worse and it became a terrible cycle  Eventually I couldn't do it anymore and realised I needed help  I'm a lot better off with the food nowadays  but I still get anxiety every day or so from general things  like going on dates and some other social events  Thankfully I'm usually able to reduce it before it gets too bad  Thanks for your response  I am not looking for a sliver bullet  just something that can takes the pressure off  or makes the thoughts a little more intermittent   Did you end up ever finding a some what helpful medication     Did you have a good experience on Prozac   Thank you  it means a lot  Great idea by the way  I'll definitely do a video on how I got to this point    happy 2017 to you  Thanks for your response  I guess I am just tired of obsessions coming out of no where and becoming life consuming  and I was hoping to start this process with the proper medication  Do you have any advice to combat hopelessness    Sleeping w my legs wrapped around a pillow  hugging a stuffed animal and possibly listening to music w wireless ear buds is what helps me w this  Give it a try  Also have you heard of "Rescue Remedy"  Its a homeopathic solution to anxiety  You can buy it on Amazon  and it's very affordable     I take their gummy version at night and it helps me go to sleep  Just make sire you don't fall asleep w it in your mouth undissolved  I try to take it early enough for that not to happen  My favorite is the black current flavor     Most important thjng to remember is these feelings are just that   feelings   and while they may feel scary  they wont kill you     Hope one of these solutions helps you  Rest easier and feel better      What   Even when I was a kid in the 80s 90s they emptied the room  It gave the janitor time to get it cleaned up and avoided a chain reaction from sympathetic pukers  Not to mention getting the kids away from the virus that is now definitely lying on nearby surfaces      I go the other way  Eat until I am full and keep going  And then panic about the inevitable nausea   A psychiatrist's job is to find a pill  to "fix" your problem   A psychologist delves much deeper and identifies unhealthy thoughts and behaviors which you have built up over many years   Your "paranoia" that people are laughing at you is most likely linked to some trauma or humiliation you experienced in early life   This has probably become a theme for you and the reason behind the trigger remains a mystery    A psychologist tries to find the memories and help you come to terms with them  a psychiatrist treats the symptoms with a pill   Sometimes we need both  If there was vomit blocking the door I might have gone out the window  honestly  I get not reacting aa badly as we do but not caring at all  Wanting to stay in the same room as    it  Oh god  No  That even sounds inhuman to me  Can't take them forever  It's better if you can deal with it on your own   Takes effort though   The only reason they gave to leave the room was that some people are sympathetic pukers  No one seems to have any damn germ awareness and I don't get how anyone would not want to prevent something as horrible as Norovirus  The thing with rape is there is almost always some sort of judgement or assumption attached  Even you said that it is your wife's tragedy  Perhaps for her it wasn't  Perhaps it isn't some dark  terrible secret that has been eating her up inside for nearly three decades  It could be  I obviously don't know your wife  but maybe it's not like that    What I'm saying is  I completely understand why someone would choose to keep being raped a secret even if the experience wasn't earth shattering for them  People tend to make a lot of judgments and assumptions about you if they know you're been raped  People you have known for years  Some people like to pin everything you say or do that is a little out of the ordinary back on being raped  Being a rape victim becomes your identity instead of something you experienced  or re experienced and re experienced and re experienced   It becomes all people see  Not saying you'd be that way towards your wife  but maybe others did treat her that way in the past so she chose not to mention it  Or maybe it didn't effect her in a big way so it wasn't even worth mentioning  Everyone's different    Yep been there  It was only after the fact  weeks after  that I realised what it was    Thank you for you comment  I really appreciate it   You're welcome   Thanks for the feedback     I believe my mother has reported this to some close  but distant relatives who are trying to help my mother   It's probably legal to move in with them too   In fact  with any relatives   Or any friends   For all your legal questions  you may be able to contact your state's Children's Lawyer or your state's Public Guardian   They may be able to help you for free   Or there's  r legaladvice     I would really prefer to keep my friends out of this   You might be able to sleep over for one night a week without telling them why   Though they might try to pry more information out of you     my little sister does not sleep alone  she sleeps with my two older sisters   Good    Edit   For information on young people's safety in general  see the book  Protecting the Gift  Keeping Children and Teenagers Safe  by Gavin de Becker   Especially do read the parts about sexual abuse   Your local public library system probably has a copy of the book   Good book   Recommended   For in depth information on child molestation  see other books   I don't know which      If my father were to be imprisoned  or die  I know for a fact that my mother would not be able to support our family on her income  which makes me sick to my stomach and nervous for the future   A   Do you still believe this is true   B   Is there a welfare system in your state or country  which gives a small amount of monthly cash to those who need it   C  How much risk is there that your dad could  Heaven forbid  ever molest your sister again  I didn't know it was defined exactly like that  However  "They are compulsions  nonetheless  which is why the term Pure O is somewhat imprecise" and "commonly referred to as Pure O by the OCD community" lead me to continue just calling it OCD  Pure O isn't a clinical term   D The little puffin  This is wonderful  I am so proud of you  Look at you go  YW  OC   Noted  Thanks What do you do when you travel alone   I just got divorced earlier last year   One thing I enjoyed was traveling with someone else   How can I really make the most of traveling by myself  People who have been raped are not somehow broken or incapable of building maintaining successful romantic relationships with others  Granted  many people need time to heal and some develop PTSD  but a loving relationship can weather it all if both parties are willing to do the work    I've only ever been in a relationship after being raped since the first time I was raped I was 15  I once was raped while I was in a relationship and I did break up that relationship off  But my subsequent relationship has been successful  I would like to think that being raped hasn't made me faulty somehow when it comes to maintaining a relationship   You need to realize  you'll make more mistakes by worrying and fearing  Mistakes are normal and even you mentioned people before you have done it  Just keep doing your project without worrying and double check whatever you're doing   I'm not worried about the surgery  it's the 23 day wait and the location that bothers me The more you worry the more you're going to stress yourself out  Mistakes will happen  You are not a robot  We are human beings  Simple  Just breathe   Yes  certainly a mis labelling  Make sure he  and the rest of your professional support group  understands that what you're experiencing are vivid intrusive thoughts  Try to monitor how often they happen and if there's any triggers  So true  Even if you weren't scared of it  why would you want to risk getting sick or smell it  The whole thing just makes my skin crawl   Well the tooth directly below my concerned tooth is actually abscessed and is also being treated during this visit  I do occasionally get the bitter taste from that one  If the tooth I wrote about in the thread post is abscessed  I'm not getting the bitter taste from it but it is slightly inflamed  as I mentioned  it's only noticeable physically  and tender  resulting in pain if touched  So I don't know if it is abscessed or the way it is because of its condition   Waiting 23 days is bothering me  I chose a bad time of the year to deal with this  That definitely sounds like a tough situation with balancing family and what happened  This might be semantics  but I just want to start off by saying that I don't think you have to rationalize what happened  Rationalizing means justifying what your cousin did  which I don't think you have to do  He touched you in ways that you did not want  not consensual  and performed sex acts in front of you that he should not have  either awake or asleep   Your healing is what is important  not anything to do with your cousin   I think that it's great that you opened up about what happened on a forum like this  That is definitely not an easy thing to do  especially with your feelings about not sharing what happened with people close to you   To answer your question  sorry about my digression   No one can tell you how bothered you should be about what happened but YOU  He did something wrong and if that bothers you a lot that is completely fine and if it doesn't at all that is also fine  Only you can decide how "wrong" it really was  If you are thinking more legally  then check out https   www rainn org articles legal role consent to see how to actually define what he did    Finally  I know you don't want to tell friends or family about what happened because you don't want to escalate the situation  but from my experience  as a certified sexual assault and domestic violence counselor   it helps a lot to open up to someone who you trust  Ultimately  friends and family care about you and your wellbeing and want to help you if you need it  It sounds like you're having a tough time thinking about what happened and talking to someone close to you may help you understand it a little better    Sorry that was a long response  Feel free to message me if you want to talk about this  Gross  I don't care if they haven't hurt anyone yet  the fact that they have those thoughts is bad enough  I'll never "accept" them  When I was younger I used to deal with anxiety by either being the quietest person in the room  or going in the exact opposite direction and acting incredibly hyper  I gained a bit of a reputation for being "random" but people seemed to appreciate it and would often join me in my hyperness  In my case I was faking it like 80  of the time but I think my fake hyperness legitimately made other people hyper  lol  In their case I think me acting that way gave them "permission" to act weird in a judgement free zone  This was in my early teens and pre teens when I actually socialized a substantial amount  I totally understand where you are coming from  A little under a year ago I was a server at a diner  I ended up having to quit because the angry people and the understaffed restaurant made my depression anxiety so bad I thought about killing myself  Now I'm a teller still struggling with these issues  We just had to fill out our annual review and I basically was completely honest and talked about how upset members crank on my anxiety and depression  Anger frightens me to the core  even if the person is not directing it at me  That's when you get when your mom has a line of boyfriends that are abusive try to kill her basically   Hello  I'm a teacher  and I'm dealing with an issue that's cropped up for me before  I get very anxious and panicky when I have to go back to school after a long break  I had a panic attack at work  not in front of students  right after Thanksgiving  and my nerves are feeling a little fiery now that I have to go back tomorrow   My goal is to call my doctor tomorrow for a meds renewal appt  and to call a counseling center and do that again  Any advice for making sure I actually achieve those goals tomorrow  The fact is is that normalization of this socially is reprehensible  Yeah  I can relate  Most of the time I'm torn between 'Don't be so quiet  you idiot' and 'Shut up  you're just being awkward    Ends up being a weird combination of silence and nonsensical outbursts most of the time   I hope you are ok  Have you reported this  You should because my biggest regret is not telling anyone about what happened to me   I now realise I'm lucky as I watch my rapist die in front me  but death is to easy for them  Paranoia is different to social anxiety for me  let me try to explain  Paranoia makes me feel like constantly looking over my shoulder  like there is a lingering thought that something someone is behind me and I cannot rest until I turn around to confirm my suspicions  some OCD tendencies present in this  there doesn't have to be any physical reason for me turn around  just a thought that manifests itself uncontrollably  also warps my mind by turning completely innocent spoken words by others into some kind of attack upon me or that they are out to get me or cause me upset or annoyance    with anxiety  I am not afraid to turn around  I am afraid I will turn around and other people will judge me negatively for it  hence while solitary I find no such judgement and anxiety is greatly diminished   so much so I have convinced myself of this that when I go out I automatically feel judged before anyone has even cast a glimpse in my direction  paranoia is easily defined in my mind  where social anxiety is multifaceted  it doesn't just come from one cause it comes from a plethora  negative thought patterns  self consciousness  low self esteem  negative reinforcement  ect   which all feed into each other    OCD  anxiety  paranoia  depression  to me seems like they are all interconnected in some way  having experienced them  and gain momentum from one another  a part of the invisible tribulations of the human condition  It sounds like you've got an exposed nerve or thin enamel resulting in sensitivity  As I suggested  keep it rinsed and clean  take your zpack  and monitor for infection  You'll likely be fine until your appointment  You're certainly not going to drop dead or anything  I wish I could just drop out too  Sexual abuse can absolutely lead to relationship issues and sexual dysfunction  This can be a somewhat complex issue  so I suggest you go to malesurvivor org or at least a consultation with a therapist or psychologist    I could give advice all day  but it looks like you are mainly looking for answers and support  Yes  while I don't know the details or your specific relationship  it is completely natural to have the issues you talk about years after experiencing sexual abuse  especially with men   I work on a sexual assault hotline  and I have talked to men who have had issues arise long after their abuse has ended  It is completely normal  and I'm really glad you had the courage to share this    If you want to talk more about this  don't hesitate to message me    EDIT  I realize that I forgot to answer whether what happened to you was sexual assault or not  The best answer I can give is that in some states it is and some it may be classified differently  Here is RAINN's database for the sexual violence laws for every state  Good luck with your healing  and thanks for sharing  https   apps rainn org policy  My 2017 goals are to just be able to pay tuition and make it to graduation    It's OK  it's not really your fault  those first days suck  What's your job if u don't mind me asking  You are definitely correct that spending time on the internet causes this problem   The dilemma in admitting I have an addiction has many parts   First and foremost  I believe I have a moral obligation to be informed   I think a lot of people who have this problem feel the same way   In the process of dealing with my anxiety I have come to realize that some or possibly even most of the information I consume is useless  in the form of editorial flair designed to generate fear   This whole thing about Trump being literally Hitler is  exactly that    I get what it is trying to prevent  but it is entirely unfalsifiable and vague   It's undeniable that there are people who will be impacted negatively by his administration's policies  but these impacts aren't really being looked at in a rational way   Editorialness goes beyond politics   it is also seen in science reporting   and much of the information consumed over the internet is drowned in it   But the nut in that shell is still useful  and often the nut doesn't come without the shell   The second problem  what to do with my time if I get this out of my life   I automatically go to my phone when I'm waiting for time to pass and I have heard the arguments for leaving it in my pocket and using the time to just think   That's fine  I can do that   But I have too much free time besides that  and often I don't want to spend money so an afternoon on Reddit is to go to activity   I already use my free time to do constructive things that cost no money  but I can't do that all the time   My break from that is Reddit   When I do feel like spending money I go out with friends but the idea of sitting around and just talking   that's one of the things I least enjoy   Any time I am in that situation I feel a strong unease  that my time would be better spent doing the creative things I like to do   That's just me I guess   I need to feel like I am being productive  and consuming information is one of those things when it's not doing something creative   The third problem is that my habits appear to be working   I am doing well in school and I have a great internship coming up   I am not in debt   I have money saved up   Success is what I want  and it looks like I'm going to get it   Could I be more successful if I change   Maybe   Anyway  I've learned to keep the anxiety under control despite not changing  and while I can improve I am looking to help anyone who is stuck in the same loop as I am while it's still happening  Will do  thank you  I take it that zpacks will help with oral infections  I was prescribed it for what was thought to be bronchitis coming on  but since the morning after I've been fine in that regard   If this was anywhere on the bottom row and not specifically where it could actually be fatal  I would be able to handle this better  Same with the inflammation having the tender area feel "heavier"  If that could just stop    It sounds like a pretty good work environment overall  especially with your boss being understanding  No one can really expect someone new to be perfect at their job while they're still learning  If you stick with it you will eventually get more used to it and find it easier to talk normally  even if your anxiety is still high  It's okay to not be perfect  Like I said  you're still learning  I also have problems with talking normally when I'm anxious and have a tendency to mix up words  forget what I just said  and generally babble and make zero sense  It definitely does make you feel like a freak since you'd think talking should be easy and people do it all the time  But I think it's great that you're trying at this and if you give a big "fuck you" to your anxiety by sticking with it  I bet you'll get a lot better at your job  I've tried  it doesn't do anything really    I would definitely be freaking out too  even if you don't have a reason too  I hope it doesn't catch you but the last time noro ran through our family  it just gave me stomach cramps  Nothing more  So if you do catch it  you aren't automatically on the train to puke town   I have also been struggling with this lately    mostly this last month  Most days it has been really bad  I haven't been that much into coloring anymore  but hopefully I can find something else to help  I constantly search the web for help  I hope we all figure it out  Thank you for your reaction and good perspective  I also put massive pressure on the relationship I had with her  but do you know or anyone on this forum how to get over it   I had to work both jobs on NYE  And then had to be back at the second only five hours later  Needless to say  my legs were achy  still are a bit  and I got  3 hours of sleep   woke up once every hour  I guess I made up for it last night because I just slept for 12 hours  I would have slept more  but then I would feel bad for not doing anything productive  I get SUPER anxious when I'm sleep deprived  And at work we weren't supposed to park in the garage but I did anyway  so the entire 8 hours I was worried about that  Nothing happened  Taking my meds every day might actually help  but I don't do that  I just am so bad at remembering  Gettin health care was a joke  it's so expensive  but I just finished college so I need something so my medicine isn't so expensive  I hope I figure this out  I hope my anxiety subsides  I just want to go a day without the pit of my stomach anxious feelings  I just want to breathe    edit  added details This is not your fault  they are rapists  It really does take some time to find the right therapist but please keep trying because when you do find the right one you will really see a change  If you find one who pushes medication and that makes you uncomfortable  keep searching  Don't give up  First days are nerve wracking for anyone but when you have anxiety a new situation can send it through the roof  Trust in yourself that they wouldn't have hired you if they didn't think you could get the job done  If you feel a panic attack coming on try some of these tips to help calm you in the moment  http   blog tranqool com 2016 10 28 3 ways to ease panic attacks  utm medium Reddit utm campaign Reddit utm source anxietysr utm term stop panic Hello  Lad  I don't know if this helps  but I've dealt with OCD for as long as I can remember and picking at my skin as a method of stress relief  Very much like you I keep picking at my acne  trying to pop it all out one by one without even realizing what I'm doing  I also pick at my lips so I'm constantly with bloody cracked lips  What helped me in this case was putting on lipgloss constantly   once they don't feel as dry the skin isn't as 'pickable' I tend to do it less and less  Maybe some kind of sunscreen might help  At least until you go see a professional and all  You will get through this and you need to remind yourself that you will  I am a big fan of using a mantra  i e  "You are okay " "This too shall pass " "I am new and learning takes time " It is wonderful that your boss is supportive  Maybe ask your boss to role play a call with you for practice   I'm married  Dated for one year  been married for almost a year and a half    The first time I had a panic attack in front of my husband I was embarrassed and afraid  but his reaction was part of how I knew he would be the one  He wanted to know what he could do to help  He held me  brought me water  helped me focus on something else and slow down my breathing  Since then  we've talked about my anxiety a lot  We've talked about the how and the why and the what and we've talked about what he can do to help and what I can do to help myself  I feel comfortable being myself around him  and that includes being anxious and even having full blown panic attacks    He's been my biggest supporter in getting mentally healthy and happy  I don't hesitate to credit him with a lot  as far as my road to mental health has gone  He's my rock    I'm actually going through this myself  Had a really bad day at work on Friday and did not do a very good job to say the least  Plus some other stressors at work with basically not being given enough time to get my job done in the time allotted  Instead of enjoying my days off  have stewed about it all weekend  Yes  about 10 years for OCD  Thanks for the reply   Did you have a problem with change  I try to change some of my behaviors  but my brain just decides to be lazy sometimes and repeats the said behaviors  even when I'm aware that this is a bad behavior  Did therapy help you with finding strategies to trick your brain into not being this lazy when trying to change  I think what concerns me is when I was young  around eleven or twelve maybe  I'd watch things on youtube that were semi pornographic and most of them if not all of them were girl on girl or just involving girls  And they'd turn me on  Today if I see pornographic things involving two girls together it actually does turn me on  But I don't want to be with a girl  So I don't understand why girls in porn would turn me on  Some people have said that pretty much anything pornographic can turn you on or that it could always be like empathy arousal  where I become aroused because I can relate with how the girls would be feeling in that situation  But that concerns me and it's something I've never really been able to let go of as a concern   I hate the feeling of crippling anxiety  All anxiety feels awful  but that one is the worst  I don't even have answers for myself  but I do understand how you feel   Best of luck to you  I suffer from severe generalized anxiety panic disorder and depression  I had three really bad panic attacks in a four day period a couple of months ago  two that lead me to going to Emergency  Last night felt like I was going to have another panic attack  Not a good feeling  Best of luck to you  Hmm  Not much else i can help with    I'd try speaking with a therapist or sleep therapist  I know what you feel when you go through it  Everything's size is out of scale compared to everything else and it induces your anxiety  Maybe you're dehydrated and need to drink more water during the day  Or breathing too shallowly    And if all else fails  meditation should help   "Things Might Go Terribly  Horribly Wrong  A Guide to Life Liberated from Anxiety " I just happened to notice it on my brother's bookshelf and picked it up because that title is pretty much exactly how I feel all the time  that everything's going wrong lol  That's good that the techniques in that book are proving helpful for you  Best of luck with everything for you too   Not usually  Why would they  If they have no complaining witness  and now complaining statements  they have no case of something being illegal  Cops are there to manage lawfulness   I do the same with my lips aswell  I'll start using Vaseline maybe that will help with that  as for the rest of my skin on my face I'll have to find other tricks to prevent picking  Thanks    I think it's a common misconception and I only really learnt it in the past year  I didn't understand mental compulsions for ages  Always good to learn new stuff  I started in customer service for ATT wireless but now I'm with a corporate travel company   Fantastic video  amazing progress   An amazing life awaits   Man  you gotta get out   I started meditating recently and it has made me realize when I day dream so much  You got to step out of your head and stop fantasizing  You owe it yourself to experience life   Start Small   You have your life to live  I'm 22 years old and I still don't know what I want to do  but I'm still searching    Fibromyalgia must suck  I would tell you to go to the gym  but I don't know how serious your pain must be  Have you tried going back to school   Do you read books     I guess what I'm saying is    it sucks that your family doesn't seem like they want to help you out  but that doesn't mean you have to just sit there and accept things for how they are  Talk to them about it  or talk to your other family members  Go back to school  that would be my first step  Socializing is a big step to greater things  still learning how to do this myself     In the words of J  Cole  " I know you're desperate for change let the pen glide  but the only real change comes from inside  "   You could look into CBD  Oil might be worth a shot  I have severe anxiety depression and Complex ptsd  i just tried the cbd oil today  and i must say  even though i only had one drop of 3  it has done something incredible for me  mind you i still feel the anxiety but it is like i'm not troubled by it  It could be something to look into   I'm sorry to hear about your mum  I and most of my friends in DC feel this way  I don't think it's going to be a nation wide phenomenon though  A lot of sufferers experience a point where they feel like they aren't themselves anymore  I have it as well after a massive attack in February last year   Thanks for answering my post   I used to be the type of person to be scared of opening up and showing my feelings and my thoughts  I still am uncomfortable when bother people and still am scared to make them lose their time  I thought I had finally found someone who understood how I felt and to whom I could open up  a genuine relationship built on trust  but my negativity and my problems just drove that friend away  I sort of hate myself for it right now   How do you find your therapist  Where do I start  I tried looking at the Psychologist Order's website in my area  to search for a therapist  today  but I'm just overwhelmed by the amount of therapist and by all the strategies they offer and all the stuff they list    Its just    how am I supposed to choose  I'm kind of overwhelmed  Did you try many medications before Prozac  If you feel it's the right decision then good  I wish you luck  im so glad that the videos could be of help      and im also glad it worked out for you two    I call it "the second worst Tuesday of my life" for a reason  The only worse Tuesday was 9 11 itself   After school shootings  I avoid the news like the plague  You can choose not to follow political news if it makes your anxiety worse  If you have Facebook  you might want to use it less often or delete it entirely  I am nearsighted and didn't know I needed glasses for years so I have a headache all the time TIRED and sore eyes     It sucks  But I'm getting glasses  I've seen it a lot on Facebook as well but it seems mostly to be going around to people who have kids or are around kids a lot   You know  our society works with the idea that woman sex  The whole thing about 'adding sex appeal' to media involves a woman  Women body is so shamelessly oversexualized that it turning you on is completely normal I'd say  Specially heterosexual sex  It's all about women being the pleasing one and man being the pleased one  Heck  I have this friend of mine that her whole sexuality was built under an abusive relationship and now  because her ex made her watch all kinds of porn with him  she says naked woman arouses her even though she thinks being with a woman doesn't really interests her    I just took little steps to get there  I told myseld 'okay just get there and if you don't like it you can leave' then once I got there I was like 'okay just walk briskly  and if you don't like it you can leave' and slowly but surely just small steps lead to me actually working out today for the first time in 4 months  Was it my fault  FYI  you can only catch norovirus if someone vomits in a room and you literally touch it and then touch your mouth face and ingest the particles   You cannot get norovirus from airborne particles unless you are literally right next to someone actively vomiting or you get vomited on or something  The particles have to go into your mouth digestive system   So that teacher probably evacuated the room because of the smell sight of the vomit  The kids would only have gotten a virus if they'd all touched it  it's nothing to do with being "aware of germs"   I understand the sentiment but it's not great to spread misinformation about this stuff  It might be as simple as that she doesn't want to cause you unnecessary pain  You should have hope  There are a lot of people out there like us  or are at least happy to love us  Each person is broken in their own way and the people who are great partners for us are the ones that don't get hurt by our jagged edges and understand that all we really want is connection even though we are terribly afraid of it as well    I'm not particularly pretty or thin but my husband and I see the best in each other and that's when you know you found someone great because they see the magic in you  Maybe he just needs time to adjust to a new environment  If he has used the litter box that's a good sign  I would get him checked out at the vet    It's hard to lose a furry friend  I had to have my toy poodle put to sleep in 2012  It was heartbreaking but she was very old and had a lot of health issues  Sometimes you have to the hard thing to spare them suffering    I know it's not easy but try to not panic too much until you've talked to a vet  I stop drinking caffeine at like 5 or 6pm  unless I'm working that late  then I don't   But I take ambien for sleep  which seems to help that problem   Just one  Zoloft didn't work for me  I have seen a lot of posts on social media about people being sick too  It's making me really anxious as well  I am worried about there being a bad outbreak of a SV   It's probably best to avoid Facebook and Twitter for a little while and attempt to distract yourself  That always helps me  Keep in mind that some of those people could have food poisoning or something else  Not everyone is as well read up on viruses and stuff as we emets are  lots of people assume if they feel pukey they have a virus even when they don't   Also  idk if this helps  but there's not really such thing as one norovirus season  Norovirus is actually just as common during spring and summer when everyone is getting together for camps holidays etc  but there's less media coverage people talking about it because they don't think it's the "season"    Just remember all the years you've gone  without  having noro  even when lots of people around you seemed to have it  You survived then  right     As long as you wash your hands like normal and don't literally clean up someone's vomit all day  you'll be absolutely fine  This is a terrible thing to say and  OP  you are 100  not at fault  It doesn't matter if you were drunk  they took advantage of you and you are NOT to blame in the slightest   No  it's not misinformation  If someone actively vomits on the tables and someone 'cleans it up' with a tissue they spread the vomit around  get it all over their hands  carry it everywhere  others touch it  the whole room potentially ends up being a risk for infection depending on how old the kids are  The teacher acted right  Bodily fluids of a sick person are a biohazard  I don't need to be told about how this stuff spreads  I spend way too much of my time researching it and with only 10 100 virus particles needed to infect a person and people threading it around under their shoes  spreading it during the clean up process etc  it's very reasonable to evacuate that room until a janitor cleaned the vomit room with bleach  Yeah it's tough to manage different aspects of your life   Try to take it one step at a time   It's okay if you can't do everything at once   Good luck  Yeah  we have a vet appointment in two hours  I'm hoping my version of very sick is the vets version of easily cured     Sorry to hear about your poodle  I'm sure they were a good pup  I know how you feel  I started my first job this summer at a fast food restaurant and after I finished my first day of training  I couldn't stop crying and was filled with so much anxiety that I called the next day and quit  I worry that I'll never be able to have a job like a normal person   Does eye contact give you anxiety   since its only the ladies that are doing it  Some animals are also picky about what food they will eat  My rat terrier is like that  She makes me worry sometimes    Bella was a sweet puppy  Also very quirky  If she saw a cow on TV she would bark at it and didn't stop for a while after the cow went away  You're so cute  great vid    I see in a post you traveled with only a backpack  I'd love to see how you packed  Packing give me huge anxiety  I'd love to learn to pack light  You are not lost  you are found  We are all in this together  I understand you completely  i know exactly what you are going through because it is the same as everyone with SA  We feel isolated  alone  upset  unmotivated and more  I've been there  I have walked down a busy street and noticed how people seem to seamlessly interact with one another all the while wondering to myself  why can't I be like that  why can't I communicate like they do  why is it so hard for me  why can't I be like them  is there something wrong with me  who am I  Why me  Will I ever be "normal"     I dont know everything  all I know is what has happened to me up to this point in my life  What I do know though is jumping in at the deep end with no supports  unable to swim and you will surely drown  I never believed in exposure therapy  but the more I think about it  the more it has helped me  I was told that challenging yourself and putting yourself in difficult situations will help with your anxiety and to a point this is true  if your anxiety is based on a specific situation  you can repeat this situation over and over and evetually you will train your brain so that it does not recognise this as a threat  but  on the other hand  if you are constantly meeting new people  you can never truly adapt which leads to constant anxiety in every social situation in which a new face appears  So If your problems are largely related to one task  such as going to a certain shop or something in which the scenario is likely the remain the same  you build up a confidence which dwarfs your anxiety at least enough to function semi "normally"  I guess what I am trying to tell you is that pick something that you need to get done in your life that requires interaction that makes you anxious and pick the least of those and do it over and over and over until you have it down to a fine art  then work upwards  will this be a cure all  No  I haven't discovered a cure all  Will this at least give you a foothold and a place to start from  Yes  After each time you push yourself that bit further  when you are home in your safe space  free from the constraints of anxious thoughts  just take some time and think  let what happened process  stop being so hard on yourself  you are trying and that is all anyone can ask of you  There are so many things I wish I could tell you that I don't know how to put into words yet  Do NOT sit an over analyze every social interaction  you know exactly what I am talking about  when you come home and you start ripping yourself apart because  you think you might have acted awkwardly or "weird"  I have started recently looking into bias modification  basically your anxious mind is attributing negativity before anything has happened  this is a negative bias and part of the negative thought cycle  you only identify the negative  only see the negative  everything seems grey and dull  Some people believe  just like you trained your brain to focus on the negatives you can train your brain to focus on the positives     Never give up whatever you do  The more you learn about yourself and your condition the more that will enable you to help yourself and help others in the same situation  always pass what you have learnt forward  no one deserves to live the life with the mental anguish we do  I have the opposite    I have to sleep for 7 12 hours a day or I get anxiety attacks from sleep deprivation  Like yesterday  I had to work both jobs and then go back to the second one only a few hours later  I barely slept  I take sleep medication  but I couldn't because I wouldn't have woke up on time  and so all day yesterday was awful  I was anxious af  Sleep does the opposite for me    until I start thinking how I'm "sleeping my life away" as my grandma used to say  You gotta find something that calms relaxes you and do it before bed   You'll get the hang of it and once you do  your whole life will be better and your social anxiety will diminish a lot  Its about learning to rely on people and trust people  and yourself   We will have to see if it's the food or just his sickness  I don't know  Worried  I'm 45 and you are my inspiration  This year I'm going to at least take a road trip somewhere instead of just going to work and home  Thank you   I can second that one can travel on a low budget with planning  Some places are more affordable during off peak seasons especially if you don t have kids in school  You need to watch exchange rates and keep track of where you money will get more and meet people  Traveling and meeting people  supporting local economies is doable  It takes sacrifice though  traveling with friends  sharing experiences  etc   Go to the library and study the travel books  you will see   Its actually not all that uncommon for people to enjoy something that society thinks they should abhor based on their pasts  My counsellor reasoned that it's our way of enjoying something that was forcibly taken from us in a "safe" way   For me  I was extensively abused from 8 15  not only sexually  but he was also physically violent and emotionally and mentally traumatizing to me  too  I also am extremely submissive in bed  and enjoy being restrained  called names and even hit  I call it "acceptable violence"  and the thing that makes all the difference from my childhood experiences is that I'm actually the one in total control  I say no  and it's a no  Nothing happens that I am not 100  okay with  I'm 31 and have been voluntarily sexually active since I was 14  Its definitely not me just working through something  as others have suggested  Ive pretty much always been this way   Thank you for the reply  I know  I really need to get out of this house  I'm starting to get claustrophobic stuck in here all the time  it's like a prison except I am totally allowed to leave   I hear going to the gym helps people and I've really considered it but then there's the problem of being broke and unable to afford it  I don't know what you mean by school  whether you mean high school or college  but if you mean college then I'm unable to because I have no way to get there  plus the courses are out of my budget at the moment  I'd like to though  I really would  Hopefully soon I can figure something out    I don't read books but I've never been much of a reader  Thanks for the support and advice  I do appreciate it   I don't know    I mean I HATED college  It took me 7 years to finish because I lost motivation after the 4th year  But I did finish  And I do feel like it wasn't a waste of my life because I was actually doing something  I really want to tell you  "no  don't do it" but it all depends on you  I know what it's like to go to school with those feelings of anxiety  panic  depression  It's awful  I think you should get some help  counselor or something  and try again  and I'm sorry  I wasn't trying to make you feel down or like its not a safe place to  voice out frustrations  but I also didn't want to reassure you  I'm sorry it was stressful  but you did great I'm so  so sorry  this was not your fault  You are not a slut  Please be gentle with yourself  and if you can  consider seeing a doctor or a therapist  RAINN org has good support available via phone or instant messaging  Hopefully everything goes well with the vet  Please update on your Kitty's condition  your comment actually helped me  I always get a little anxiety right before going back to work after a long weekend and saw two or three stomach virus posts so I'm freaking out a little bit that it'll be unavoidable this season  But you're right the last time the SV hit my house was 6 years ago and that was when my mom was babysitting kids in our house  Now  none of us really have contact with children  who seem to be the main cause of the spread   Just praying and hoping I don't catch it this year  Do you ever get the feeling like  is it my time  Or it's been so and so long it's definitely my time  I guess I'm just having an off day after the holidays and going back to reality  No therapist will tell you that you were wrong for going to therapy  It takes a lot of strength to go  It is important to take care of yourself now instead of letting problems escalate  You are clearly not lazy if you are taking the first step by getting help  This article may help you understand the different types of therapists and what may work for you  http   blog tranqool com 2016 04 11 what are the different types of mental health service providers  utm medium Reddit utm source socialanxietysr utm term providers I'm totally crying over here cuz this is amazing  Your happiness comes across in the video and I can't help but be so happy for you  Yeah  I've got some stories in the bag     including "that time I got uber scammed by some drunk russians"   I think it's good practice for small talk  I think I might try it one night  but put on a different persona    the charismatic version of me  just for practice  Yeah  it doesn't feel good  It makes me wish I was young again and carefree like them  It's amazing how shallow these conversations among young people are  But I'm sure they're having fun  I definitely think it's worth a try for you  If anything  just to get some exposure to people  though the dynamic is definitely a lot different than real socialization     I actually went to a 2nd run last night  Mostly normal pay  so a very meager payout  I was trying the 30 trips for  100 bonus  Then I realized it's like a video game trying to make you stay on it longer  And the surge pricing is like pokemon go  gathering people trying to find that rare pokemon  I think those elements make it a little more interesting addicting  What do you think  Hi there  I can really empathise with this   I had bad cystic acne and am a compulsive skin picker  mostly around my fingernails  but also lips and face   I use tweezers and clippers as well as picking with my nails in the vain attempt to make my skin feel 'smooth' and I often pick until I bleed  and am never satisfied that it feels 'right'  I do have some tips to help though   I put plasters over my fingers at night  and exfoliate and moisturise my face lips which makes my skin feel slightly smoother   Also  I tend to pick when I'm nervous agitated worried  so stress or fiddle toys can help to distract  Solving a Rubix cube is a good way to keep your hands busy too  plus it gives your brain something else to focus on  If none of these work for you personally though  remember that there are plenty of people out there with the same compulsion if you want to talk or vent  Yes  I hate change  I feel much calmer when I can stay in my predictable routine    I can't say I've had much luck with tricking my brain  It has been more like "screw you  brain  I'm doing this anyway" to consciously change the behavior  otherwise I would continue the same way  Therapy helped me give as much weight to the logic as to my feelings anxious thoughts  It's hard to explain  expressing myself is one of my issues  but it helped my to kind of accept what I'm feeling for the moment without letting it totally control me  I can sort of transition the behavior until it becomes more natural     As an example  one of my ways of coping with anxiety is to over exercise  so I make the decision to stop at a certain time before starting even though it makes me very uncomfortable  to say the least  When that time comes I feel quite anxious about stopping at an "incorrect" time according to how long my anxiety says I need to go  but I do it anyway  I sometimes feel terrible about it for a while  but I am able to think back later or the next day and see that was the right choice  It's a lot of work  but I am starting to do it more automatically and with less angst  I will  Only an hour before we go    For me  I had strong associations with the few episodes where I v  For instance  eating a certain food and then v soon after  For years I would avoid that food and eating it would make me feel n  I finally realized that by exposing myself to this food  aka forcing myself to eat it sometimes and realize that I will be okay and not v  I can slowly subdue the memories that come from the v episode after  In your case  perhaps you can remind yourself when you feel that way you did before that it's all in your head and that you are going to be fine  The more you repeat that mantra  the less and less the anxiety will be around to bother you  Ok I'll look into it  do you recommend certain types of school like cyber school  You're not contagious until you v or have d  And even then  the virus can only be spread through feces or v particles  I have intrusive thoughts as well  don't google stuff   1 rule is do not google stuff  Also remember you are not your thoughts  as horrifying and disturbing as they might be  it is only thoughts   I wish I had your courage  You're awesome  On Facebook  every time a friend shared a news story  I clicked "unfollow all from  news source  " I was merciless  Legit sources  fake sources  clickbait  all of it  It took a few weeks  but now 98  of what I see on my feed is just my friends' lives  It's really made Facebook less stressful   yes totally  You should start psychotherapy if you have not already  Dont lose hope  there are ways out of this   I have OCD as well and have a 12 year old dog  I get anxious about leaving her too  mostly because I just miss her or am worried that she misses me  Then I get anxious about her being anxious about missing me   gotta love the vicious cycle  All in all I just remember how happy we make each other and how great it will be to see her when I come home     Maybe you could take a picture of him with you or have him be the picture on your phone wallpaper  I know seeing pictures of her always makes me feel better     Paranoia is a potential symptom of social anxiety   I have had the same problem thinking people are laughing at me from behind or wherever  and have also thought people have said things like you mentioned  fag  about me too   SA makes you over sensitive to your environment and can max out self consciousness  thus making you paranoid    Edit  I don't think I articulated that correctly  Paranoia and social anxiety are different things  But sometimes I think they can go hand in hand  Ex  being paranoid that people are laughing at me  and being terrified and feeling bad about myself for it    Hey  I first want to say you are not alone  I've been diagnosed for almost a year now and although I have learnt to deal with a lot of my triggers etc    I can go through "waves" of having very bad nightmares and also I do get sleep paralysis  It's so scary so I completely understand where you are coming from  I've found that listening to something calming before sleep helps a little   Hey  follow up  I went to the doctor  they made a bunch of tests to me and it turned out im healthy  It was anxiety  purely psychological  I knew it  Im afraid ill live my life like this  Having fear  I'm the same  I fear making phone calls  I'd rather text  But when I can't avoid it I panic  Pro tip  work for an airline  Acquire  nearly  free travel benefits  at the good ones anyways   Sauce  doing that now  And no  it's not just for pilots and flight attendants  there's shit tons of jobs you can do at airlines  Well  you aren't going to know   And one big problem we often have is thinking that there is some "perfect path" that we need to find out enough facts to pick   Understand that you have virtually no information that you can get as to whether these people are good or not  and really whether they are good for your issues that you don't even understand yet  so there's no facts to be found as to which to pick   Hopefully that can take away some of the drama over picking one   When I started I just opened Google Maps  typed in "psychologist" and picked the one closest to me  Guess what  terrible way to pick a therapist  and I got virtually nothing out of it   Next time I did the same  wrote down the  12 names in my town  and started googling all of their names until I found one that had papers published and was a member of a psychological association  meaning I thought he took his profession seriously   When I moved to this place  I searched the local subreddit and found a post by someone asking for one  and people had replied with a couple suggestions   I emailed the highest rated one  but he had retired and pointed me at another therapist he works with   It's hard to understand the differences   In general a psychologist who does therapy has more training than a basic therapist   You might look for someone who specializes in anxiety  but I think our issues are pretty basic in comparison to psychological issues  so you can likely get progress from anyone   I don't mean to take them lightly  I just mean there are more specific deeper issues like years long family abuse that you might want someone specialized in that for  Thank you very much  Your answer gave me some confidence  and I'll try once again when I see him this weekend  and if I can't do it  I'll do as you said  The Reddit community has some over the top ultra liberals  It also is full of trolls that move around subs to see what type of havoc they can wreak  Don't let it get to you  It isn't worth it   I suffer from this too  Check out r CompulsiveSkinPicking   whole subreddit dedicated to this    I'm so sorry you're going through this  The only thing I can say is that people make mistakes   you were only 13 at the time  I think you need to try and focus on the future and be kind to yourself  it sounds like you are just going round in circles in your head  you should still allow yourself to have these thoughts   but try and not let them consume the life you have ahead of you   The antibiotic will certainly help fight off potential infection  And I understand  it's hard not to worry when you're in discomfort  I've certainly been there  An anti inflammatory like Tylenol may help as well  no need to heavy dose here    Good luck  I would warn you to be very careful here  Any intervention on your part may end up causing her to be abused worse  You cant control her  and she may not be ready to leave  I know that sounds kinda sad  but in all honesty  be very very careful  Shes not asking for you to be a white knight here and rescue her  Your actions may backfire spectacularly  Please check out thehotline org and see the information for family and friends  Things you may expect to be helpful can be deeply damaging  Abusive relationships are very complex  People dont stay in them because they like being hit  Its much much more then that going on  This is why it takes an average of 7 attempts to really leave  And why its the most dangerous time  Please dont just try to make yourself feel better or like a rescuer   Public speaking is a big hurdle for people who don't have anxiety issues    win for sure  thank you  It's nice to know I'am not the only one Well it took me untill I could live with it and it faded away but i still have rare moments when i'm triggerd What do you mean by "going to be"  I feel like it already is  and he isn't even president yet  I mean  I live on the exact opposite coast of DC  and it feels like the air itself has gotten 10  thicker since the election   I can't imagine living in DC come inauguration day  Jesus Christ  Buy all the guns  take the day off work  lock your doors  and get liquored up  For the benefit of others here  you were banned for advocating the murder of all pedophiles   That is awesome that you are pushing yourself  Freeways are tough because you are "trapped" between exits    I know that fear well  And   It gets easier from there  this video confuses me so much  You missed out on some things in high school sucks but you can't do anything about it  In college or university you can do the same kind of stuff I was basically the same exact way in high school knew a lot of people but didn't hang out much  Now I'm a freshman in college and took a chance and went to a school 16 hours away to play a sport in college and it was best decision of my life  I remeber the night of the of the first party and everyone on the team was bout to go out and I was scared shitless but just went and had a great time  Just try and go out and go to more parties or school events and stuff like that if its bad you can always leave  Good luck homie  My Facebook isn't actually that bad  I accidentally curated myself one of those bubbles you hear about  About 5 years ago  I went through a vicious culling  and now the people I interact with regularly are all  if not aligned  deeply friendly    EDIT      I call it "the second worst Tuesday of my life" for a reason  The only worse Tuesday was 9 11 itself   I know a lot of people feel that way  but I feel a little relief to see someone else type it  How did you  if you did  vote in 2000 and 2004  And what was the sense  I will ask a mod there if I can post our conversation about how I did no such thing  If you find the death penalty for pedophiles abhorrent and deserving or the death penalty  it is not the same as advocating to go out and kill all of them personally   I never did as such  and in the context of all my comments on the subject  including "as a survivor of sexual abuse as a child"   I found it petty  I posted here to vent due to the environment of Reddit that I believe fosters pedophilia and pedophile apologists  Here  of all places  is where you tell lies about me  barely scan what i said  and harass me  And you're a mod    Fuck off  Eat shit and die   And no  that's not a death threat  I hear ya  I struggle a little bit because some people who  otherwise  might be very intelligent and compassionate end up believing some very stupid shit  and I feel like I should be stepping in just a touch and saying  "guys  no  This is obviously wrong " But then is that just an overinflated sense of self  Additionally  I see you're a mod of r documentaries that is apparently now stalking through my profile and attempting to harass me in a sub for survivors of sexual abuse  There are things I've gone through in life that were the cause of some of my anxiety and their anniversaries can cause anxiety even when I don't seem to consciously think about them  My victory I am celebrating is  the realization that anniversaries had passed without me noticing either consciously or unconsciously  I thought many stomach viruses were airborne  There are no excuses for rape  The only people at fault are those people who did this to you   I hope that you have gotten medical attention  It's important to look after your physical health   You may want to find support through the RAINN website  Or visit pandys org  Take good care of yourself  Thank you   They are both the singer  and show her fighting with herself  The little girl acts tough because she's learned to and tries to scare the rational adult away  He is fascinated with her and tries to take care of her  but she is untrusting  When she leaves she makes fun of him because he can't  Then she realizes they need to work together in order to be whole  But only she can leave the cage  he can't    Basically to me its about how innocence becomes fucked up with trauma and our rational side is trying to reach out and calm us  It's an internal struggle between getting well and trusting again  or protecting yourself at all costs  And then at the end once you've learned to rebalance yourself the cage of trauma is still there  You can't escape that entirely    look down  Don't make eye contact  Act like you're busy on your phone or using the register  Pretend you're busy  Line up the clothing signs with their heads so they can't make direct eye contact  Oh shit they saw you anyway     Smile    ah shit they think you're faking it now because of that twitch you always have in your left cheek when you smile at strangers  Their eyes have clouded over they definitely hate you now  Shit they're coming over here  Shit shit shit  "Hi  can I help you ma'am " I have always  always wanted to go to Europe  Maybe one day     That's some good sauce   Thanks  that helps a good bit  I just try and distract myself as long as possible from them It has been back and fourth  I guess i have been the first to text more often than not    I fell asleep during our last texting spell cause i was really tired  But responded when I woke up the next morning  Heard nothing back  Then I sent a voice message wishing him a happy new year and that the next one will be better still  And a picture  This was on the 30th    Facebook Messenger gives me the added benefit of more information  read receipts and Last Active notice  he hasn't  read  any of them and he hasn't been on for more than a day    I don't think messaging him will provide any benefit  I mean i could text directly to his phone  but Then i worry i'm coming off as pushy or somesuch  It's a fucking struggle when every avenue in front of me involves a degree of mental emotional anguish The first election I could vote in was 2008  but I remember the elections back to 2000  Gore won in a landslide in our mock election in fifth grade  This year seems like a more depressing repeat of 2000  where Hillary played Gore  Trump played Bush  Jr    and Gary Johnson what's his face played Ralph Nader  I've been told Hillary actually won the popular vote too  a la Gore   My mother said this year reminded her of Nixon winning in 1972 after she spent the summer campaigning for McGovern  but was still too young to vote for him  I'm just glad Trump is less popular than Bush Jr  and Reagan were  though I wasn't around during the Reagan era myself   I voted for Bernie Sanders in the primary this year  and Obama in every past presidential election back to the 2008 primary  I remember a slogan I saw online during the Bush Jr  era  It said "We are sorry our president is an idiot   we did not vote for him" in a bunch of different languages  That sucks man  I'm 23 and left school extremely early like you did so I'm in a similar boat  No education  no possibility of real work  no way to get anywhere or get anything accomplished without help  Shit sucks  I think I would disintegrate if I didn't have my computer to keep me occupied  I'm sorry your family isn't helping you at all  You are waaaayyy too young to have lung cancer unless you've been sucking up asbestos  It would also be getting progressively worst  Trust me  your doctors wouldn't be able to disregard how sick you were    My former boyfriend died of lung cancer at 27 and he was made into a case study because he's case was so rare  He also had what seemed like a never ending flu and was diagnosed through a x ray   Now anxiety can cause shortness of breath and a small red drop of blood was probably just your throat being irritated    Go back to your doctor and ask for an allergy test and an x ray  That way you'll know what allergies you have  if any  and the x ray will see if you have cancer or pneumonia or whatever  This is literally me  My boyfriend wants me to go out with him and his male friends and it is so exhausting  Especially in the holidays when he asks everyone out and they could fill a small bus  It makes me feel very uneasy because I dont care about these peopla and they dont care about me and we have nothing in common  I end up being silent while the bf is having a blast and I keep pretending to laugh and smile  I even pretend not to be bothered by their "manly" dirty jokes that sometimes are borderline offensive to women  It is all so fake  Not to mention the horrible feeling I get because I remember I have zero friends  Staying home reading a book would be less traumatic  really    I probably can' t be of much help but I have talked about this with the bf  After yesterday's charade he finally gets it  All I can say is  do your best to talk to your gf about it  Eventually she will realize that it does more harm than good  Here is a  Seven day round trip flight  https   matrix itasoftware com  view details research ORDTXL TXLORD solution 0BvVJ8uG14l7PcKqoS3ypoS 7JSe6p1TYa5N2walTTELkK003  from Boston to London for  370   I'm not sure where you are  but flights to Europe have never been cheaper   You should at least look into it  39 and haven't done a damn thing worth mentioning yet   Fml lol If you had an abscessed  you'd wish for death  It is so incredibly painful  Like mind blowingly so  Trust me  My husband who is a tough military man was curled up in a ball  crying in the ER    You are probably good to wait until your appointment  Now if the pain is so horrifying you can't deal  go to the ER  But otherwise  you are most likely good  So inspiring and you're happiness is so adorable  I loved this  Might have to take a leaf from your book some day  Well done and congrats x Yeah  I could  But He's said that he often isn't online for extended periods of time  And i guess this would be one of those times     Thanks for talking this out with me   I've just been freaking out      Hmm  I see  It is a bit less stressful to know that there is no wrong or right way to pick one  I should almost pick some at random near my workplace and choose from those   Thanks for your help  It is very appreciated  I'm sorry that this happened to your friend  Has she been tested for STI's  It's important that she take care of her physical health as well as mental and emotional   There's great information for how to support a survivor of sexual trauma on the RAINN website  You might direct her there for information and a forum that they host  Pandys org is also a great online resource   http   www capefearpsych org documents Rape mensguide pdf The above guide has great information for anyone supporting a survivor though it is directed towards men   Your friend may turn to you for support if she needs to vent  is confused  frustrated  angry or depressed  It's important to validate her feelings and let her know that she is doing the best she can  You may want to have an idea of what resources are available to her in her community if she becomes suicidal  As well  she will need more than a few supportive people to turn to so it would help if you can encourage her to reach out here and to close friends   Allow her to decide what steps to take in regards to reporting and healing  Rape and sexual assault are about taking power and control away from a person  Allowing that person to choose who to tell and when gives them control over their own healing   Take care of yourself while supporting your friend   Thank you  I still have 800 mg ibuprofen but running low  Hopefully they'll approve a refill  you literally have to swallow someone's vomit or feces particles to catch norovirus  This sounds like a wonderful I think I understand what you're trying to say  I'll try to find a therapist and find out by myself if my brain will cooperate   Thank you for taking the time to answer me  It helped a lot  They might be shy  and INTERESTED IN YOU  Also  it's normal to glance at others occasionally  Of course  I don't know your situation  so I can't say if this is true or if they're being weird  They don't seem to be avoiding you  just averting their gaze     That's reassuring  thank you  I had an abscessed tooth extracted before rather recently and it never pained me  I imagine your husband either had bad luck or had his with or without knowing for longer than he should have  maybe   A buddy of mine had one on his upper right canine and got awakened in the middle of the night in extreme pain and major swelling  Out of the blue and didn't know he had it  Knowing this is making it difficult because "what if"  you know  Great  I hope to be able to do this some day  Yay for accomplishments  A normal doctor or even a nurse practitioner should be able to help you set up a "get off the meds" plan  You should probably go to your family doctor or the person who prescribed it to you for continuity's sake  but any medical professional should be able to help    If it goes like my own meeting to get off citalopram  you'll sit down and confirm that you are no longer depressed anxious  Then you'll be recommended to taper down the dosage over a certain amount of time  two months for me  until you are free of the pills  You'll also be given a list of symptoms or effects you may have  how to deal with them and when to get a medical professional   I talked to my relatives when they were over last night  instead of just reading while in the room with everyone like I would normally do   The problem is last time I double triple quadruple checked and there was still an error  I have some OCD like tendencies and situations like this will make me check over and over but in the case of this particular project it's easy to mess up  let's just say the project has a million moving pieces   I know that's why others have before me  but it just makes me so stressed   Yeah  it's totally understandable and normal  for people with this phobia anyway    What helps me is remembering just  how unlikely  it is that I'll catch anything if I just pay a normal amount of attention to hygiene and what's going on around me  If I'm ever around noro I  will  know about it and I will take steps to avoid it  Sorry you're going through this too  I've just been a huge ball of anxiety about going into work tomorrow and it's been really stressful   Maybe  I don't typically look into his mouth   P   But yes  I know exactly what you mean about the what ifs  However  I'm sure that you will be fine until your appointment   Nothing to say other than I am the exact same  It sucks Literally impossible if you haven't been exposed to the virus  And believe me  you'll know if you're exposed to it  This is only true if you're beside someone while they are vomiting  as the particles disperse into the air briefly before landing  as the particles may land on your lips face hands  But it's an incredibly tiny chance  Viruses of the digestive system need to enter your digestive system to work   they can't do that if inhaled  Thank you so much ladyorchid  I hope that your work week proves to be less stressful and anxiety provoking as you anticipate   Thanks a lot for the support  I appreciate your help   A  I do believe that if my father were to be imprisoned that foster homes could become a possibility   B  There are welfare systems that would be helpful in the event of my father being imprisoned  or dying   C  I honestly believe that my father wouldn't do it again  but you can never be sure  I suggest that you put yourself on a wait list to meet with a trauma therapist  It may be months before you meet with a professional but like any other wait list others will drop out because they've found services elsewhere  chosen to try a different type of therapy or have other issues come up in their life   While you wait to begin therapy you can learn a bit more about childhood sexual trauma  There are many books written on the subject  Peter Levine's "Healing from Trauma" for example   Some websites  pandys org  include reading lists  You could also begin to write down what you recall about your abuse and or your emotions around it  You might try using art or poetry to express yourself  No one needs to see your final results  You can tear up everything you create  which may be cathartic   You could visit websites like RAINN  pandys org  etc to see what they offer online  Some websites offer forums that you can join to gain advice perspective  Reading about what other survivors are doing or coping with may help you  You can also continue to post read here and or on the rape counselling sub   Take good care of yourself  Makes sense that it's the case on the west coast too  It probably won't be in super conservative southern states though  I expect there to be some significant buyers remorse coming down the pipeline quickly due to working in public health  The on going opioid epidemic and Trump's current appointees do not bode well for places like West Virginia  Ohio  Pennsylvania etc  when it comes to adequate federal planning and funding to the problems that come with this  Least we forget that Mike Pence dragged his feet for 3 months to allow a county with an HIV outbreak set up a needle exchange program because of his uninformed beliefs  Unfortunately many people do not think about public health issues until they happen to them and with those states it's not a question of if  it's when  It is terrible to say because it places blame on the victim by implying they put themselves into that situation  The problem isn't that a teenager was drinking with older kids but that those older kids violated boundaries they shouldn't have violated  I don't think you should be commenting in this forum if you can't comprehend this   I also found that Sertraline really was not for me  and made me a lot more unstable  Citalopram worked a lot better for me   Don't want to sound like a nagging mother but any drugs tend to be bad for people with anxiety   some in the short term  all in the long term  With unstable brain chemistry  the last thing you want to be doing is    screwing with your brain chemistry  Lay off the drugs  and try journalling to see what you're thinking about and when  This is such a perfect description   Okay sweet  Thanks so much "Intrusive thoughts are a result of your creative imagination mixed with anxiety and exhaustion"  I know intrusive thoughts are shocking or disturbing but they are not you  You have to try to not react to them with fear  Fear   Anxiety   Anxiety   Fear  Instead dismiss them taunt the thoughts  The way I do this is by telling myself  "Whatever  is that the best you got   Give me worse thoughts  c'mon I dare you" What I do by doing this is eliminate the fear from those thoughts  I know it seems crazy to ask your anxiety to give you more  but we need to stop fearing it so it does not take control over us  I keep doing that step if a new thought pops up and then I engage myself in an activity   Staying idle is bad for us folks with anxiety  Find yourself something to do  something that makes you think hard about what you're doing  Like a puzzle or crossword to name a few  If you stay put you'll just end up thinking about your thoughts or anxiety    I learned this from a book I read that has helped me greatly   PM me if you ever need to talk to someone    You're strong too  Seems like the holidays have been a big trigger for a lot of people  All we can do is take it one day at a time and keep working to improve   That's pretty reassuring  I'm hoping the same will happen to me  It makes enjoying life slightly difficult sometimes   Yay  congrats  that's awesome   D If you don't want to wait for the blood test results you can go to a walk in clinic and have it done immediately  When I feared it  they literally took 2 seconds and checked and boom I didn't have it at all     Hope that helps   I was TERRIFIED  It was so quick and easy  Facts get in the way  huh  That's great    you do you      that's actually a really beautiful description ty   i see it now for sure  I sure hope so  Do you know where his abscess was located  i try to keep telling myself that   but  ya know  emeto brain  I'm the same    was meant to take my two years ago     after many lessons but choked    I am afraid of causing crashes literally anything on the road  Driving at night  freeways    I am not familiar with that  but that would be extremely helpful  Thanks so much  If you are noticing them looking at you  aren't you looking at them  too  If someone looks at me  I do look at him  That's perfectly normal     or   Are you noticing it from the corner of your eyes  Because if so  and I am sorry for saying that  that can kind of fool you sometimes    Anyway  I kind of believe it's the first option  You are paranoid and have anxiety  You are looking  maybe even gazing   at other people  They look at you  You get more paranoid and feel more anxiety  And so on and so on  I hate touching small objects  especially those made with metal  like coins or jewelry  I also hate their smell  Oh  I'm glad I'm not alone in this fear  as weird as that sounds   I'm having a similar issue with my neighbors right now as well  I called the local DV center a little over a week ago  and they advised not to call the police but to leave center's cards and flyers in a visible spot near the entrance to the building  It's very hard to hear the violence and do nothing  but calling the cops can make it worse   It sounds a bit mean almost but it's nice to see I'm not the only one in this kind of position  I never hear about people dropping out of school as young as 13  stuff like that  I'm sorry you're in the same position as I am  it's not a nice place to be  Most of them have boyfriends though  and I heard some of them talking about how they don't like me behind my back eye contact from strangers yes o O it's very late here    but I've been seeing one in four for over a year now in Ireland and couldn't recommend them more highly  they've been very supportive and offer more services than just one to one therapy     I waited almost a year to start seeing someone  but the quicker you contact them the quicker they'll see you      pm me if you'd like more info     people know I was sexually abused  but my abuser is also dead and was my biological father  and others  as I was used in the production of cp  so i have never disclosed who abused me to anyone in my family as they all think very highly of him  pillar of the community sort of situation      the laws with Tulsa have changed  and again  feel free to pm and I can go into detail of that if you like  but naming someone whether dead or not involves reporting and investigation   No need to apologize for sharing your thoughts  I'm sorry that this happened to you   I'm glad that you have reached out here and have been getting professional help  It often happens in therapy that a person will come to a wall  There seems no way through it  I found with my therapy that I progressed as far as I could with the therapist I was seeing and for where I was in life  I thought I was done but other issues came up a few years later  I chose to meet with a different therapist   Since I work in an agency where survivors get therapy   I'm not a counsellor or therapist  I often hear of clients returning after a break or returning after confronted with other issues  Some will try a different form of therapy and find success  So there are other ways to get through that pane of glass that appears to be blocking your progress  As well  different therapists have different approaches and skills  A different professional may be what you need   It may be worth it to take a break  meet with a different therapist and or try a different therapy approach  I suggest that you talk to your therapist about this Healing from trauma is a journey unique to each of us   Best wishes on your healing journey  I've been married for 2 years  My anxiety didn't develop until Oct  2016  lots of things going on at my very stressful job and with my parents  My husband was actually the first one to tell me that I may be experiencing panic attacks   Before I knew what a panic attack was  I didn't know what was wrong with me  I kept freaking out thinking I was having a heart attack and kept going to the hospital  My sweet husband would accompany me every time even though he was dead tired from work  Of course the drs would never find anything wrong with me  He was actually the one who pointed out that every time we'd arrive to the urgent care facility  I'd calm down He told me  "i think it's all in your head"  Then I started analyzing it and I was like  you're right  they never find anything wrong with me and I feel so much calmer when I get to the hospital because it's like my "safe zone"  After some therapy sessions and reading an awesome book I more or so recovered  He's been by my side and is always snapping me out of it when he notices I'm zoning out 'cause I'm probably wrapped up in anxious thoughts  He lets me talk to him about all my thoughts  no matter how irrational they may be or if he's heard them a million times before  He never makes me feel dumb about it  he reassures me  and by venting to him  I feel better    At first before I could get a grasp on my anxiety it was a little difficult for us because he didn't understand as much and felt helpless every time I'd be panicking and crying  He stuck with me  and I'm grateful   My resolution was to be confident going out in public alone  My friends aren't interested in going to bars dinner or seeing the movies I want to  so I used to just not go  But today I'm typing this from a sports bar where I'm grabbing wings and a drink  Alone  Granted I'm on Reddit mobile to not have to talk to people but  hey  it's a big step     I travel  and I am definitely not rich  I plan ahead and save my money  Check out  r Shoestring and  r solotravel  Flights are usually the biggest cost  Once you get someplace  you can typically eat  sleep  and explore for relatively cheap   So brave  Great job  So proud of you  You inspire me    Got it  thanks a ton  Feeling a bit better now  being a night owl and having anxiety isn't always the best for me  I  definetly  agree idleness is a recipe for anxiety  I figured that out a little less than 3 years ago  when my anxiety really started getting to me  But I have been suffering a lot from idleness and it's resulting anxiety as I've been having trouble with making friends in school  but my social situation does seem to be getting slightly better  had like an existential crisis on Thanksgiving and have been trying to convince myself to take more risks in life  anxiety has always forced me to play it safe  never living it up like I should be  Anyway  enough talking about my problems  don't wanna seem self centered  Really appreciate your comment   I'm not a professional but I am a fellow OCD sufferer and from what I can tell you do sound like you are suffering too  Again  I'm no professional obviously so this isn't me diagnosing you and standing on some pedestal  I suffer with a lot of compulsions too and rituals just like you've mentioned  I suspected for about 6 years that I had it and self diagnosed myself in my head  It wasn't until last year  a few months ago that I finally broke down and saw a mental health professional and was officially diagnosed  Seeing a doctor will help you  Even if it's just to get that official diagnosis so you can stop torturing yourself  There are plenty of resources online to help you too  I wish you well   I have exactly the same thing except it is not on my face  it is on my scalp and once I picked it that much it started bleeding and I got infection and had to take antibiotics the downside of it was I have a compulsion for hairbrushing and boy did that really hurt    I have it now and am even worried about getting a hair cut and i look like cousin IT from the Adams family at the moment lol  Anyway I still have to find a way to stop myself and seems like the most hardest habbit ever to break and would like some suggestions too  Hope things get better for you  And thank you for sharing  I had a feeling that your job would be a call center   My advice would be to get out of there and put in as much notice as your new employer will allow  Most places will respect the fact that you want to leave on good terms  Best of luck with everything   I chew the inside of my lips too and the inside of my cheeks  Never realised how common it is  Speaking from my personal experience i think it depends on the psychiatrist and your country   some doctors will avoid as much as possible to prescribe SSRI's to everyone and may tell you that you're just shy and maybe give you some propranolol   others will try some SSRI's and see which one

no smooth road for any of us  As we go down it  we need to remember that    Happiness   is a talent we   develop     Not an object we seek  It's the ability to bounce back From life's inevitable setbacks    Some people are crushed by misfortune    others grow because of it    "   some lady that passed away and this quote was shared by a family member    I would be more than happy to help you

really  I was always too ashamed and scared after a psychologist laughed at me when I began to cry bc she had asked me whether I was sure about my father touching me  It really scarred me and prevented me from ever seeking help again  This sounds awful but it's relieving to know that I'm not the only one  I get stuck  in a rut  gaming for pleasure escape  and I'm helped by doing something nice for my Body  Afterwards my mind is not so self defeating  I'm guessing I'm unable to think through some feeling thing my Body is telling me    An hour of exercise helps me  or meditation  Particular to me  but I find grooming  trim nails  helps me clear my head too  https   www reddit com r Anxiety comments 5lg3o6 i cant function due to work anxiety my mind feels   Thought I'd link

how pathetic I am  Now work starts again tomorrow and my mind is exhausted from worry   So you are not alone  and it could be much worse   They basically can't tell us anything  of course  They gave him a shot for upper respiratory problems  and told us he was indeed drooling more than usual   But we haven't had him long so we're just saying he's an extra nervous cat  I don't know  My mom is being ultra negative about the whole thing and I can't mentally handle the situation so yeah Thank you for sharing this with me  Sorry you had to go through all of that and I am really happy about therapy working for you  I'm really afraid of putting myself out there  so to speak  I'va had a therapist laugh at me and have never really seeked further help   10 up votes  no comments  Lol   I've always been introverted  Maybe had a very small case of social anxiety  But I've never been an "anxious" person  I've never had any panic attacks  never been scared or nervous of a situation where that wouldn't be considered normal     And then on June 11  2015 I had a genuine anxiety attack  Fear of heart attack  sense of impending doom  irrational fears of random things  was afraid of ANYTHING yellow for example   Wife rushes me to the ER  they pump me full of sedatives to calm me down and tell her I had a SEVERE anxiety attack  so severe that it did actually register on their readout monitors which I'm told is incredibly rare for someone who's merely having a panic attack   Two weeks later I had another one  Completely stopped being a functioning adult of 25 years  Couldn't answer simple questions  couldn't walk  lost all motor control and it was like the sane part of me was locked inside my head  helpless as it watched the crazy part of me take over and say and do things I didn't want to happen  Wife rushes me to the ER again   One week later I had another panic attack  but this time my wife and I worked through it at home   Each time I had an attack  I was dying  I was sure of it and it didn't matter how wrong I was or how crazy I was acting  To me everyone else was crazy  Everyone else didn't know or couldn't know the truth that only I knew  That I was dying   The fear is   unimaginable  And it hurts knowing that only those who go through it themselves can ever truly understand how when you're in the middle of an anxiety episode  that facts don't matter anymore  To me  I'm DYING  And no amount of readouts or explanations can change that   Reality shifts on itself and suddenly the rules change  But you're the only one playing by them now   As I write this now  my last severe anxiety attack was in July of 2015 and my last minor anxiety attack  a standard panic attack  was in September of 2015  I'm over a year now without any issues whatsoever and yet     I'm different  I'm not depressed or suicidal or anything like that  But I'm   scared  A lot more than I ever used to be  It's not real fear   it's not even anxiety   it's just   I don't even know how to describe it   I guess it's like a scar  Or maybe it's like when someone breaks their wrist  The pain is gone and I've healed  but I cant move my wrist as far as I once could     Maybe something similar has happened to my mind  Maybe having those random  unprovoked and severe episodes scarred my mind and even though I'm better now  maybe it's not as whole as it once was   I'm right there with you  I am not the same person that I once was and I don't think I'll ever truly get back to being him  Something in me is broken  It's not major  I function just fine  but something isn't right  nonetheless  and hasn't been since  Your username just hurt my brain  I kept hearing "Sonic The Hodgeheg" and kept thinking it was supposed to maybe be Heghodge and finally heard hedgehog in my head haha    Anyway  I would keep yourself preoccupied before the date  Work on a hobby  For example  if you play piano  learn a new song  Read a book  read the news  If you live in a big city that has their own subreddit  read the news in there  Keep your day filled  Run errands like grocery shopping  Anything can happen during the day  random stuff  and you can comment on that  Watch a movie the night before    "Have you seen      " and perhaps they love whatever actor is in it  yada yada  Good luck    I can't promise any time during the night on occasion  but I'm a pretty active texter and always make the effort to get back as soon as possible  I'm 31 f so if you feel comfortable  feel free to PM me   You seem to be looking for answers externally  Only you can quiet your mind  Only you can be happy with your own company    If you never learn to depend on yourself  you're gonna have a bad time  The only thing you have is yourself  It's true for all of us    Once you start being happy with your own company and start to like yourself as a person not only will you be happy but you'll attract people who like to be around you    Look inwards  not outwards  No  as long as you've washed your hands and all you should be fine  You probably don't even need to do that  but I know it helps me in those types of situations  I'm sorry you've been treated like that  Yes  it's the feeling that I get  I feel as though people were only able to see me as an object to use for their own pleasure and feel sick to my stomach  dirty and unworthy of love   If it were of help  I'm here if you need someone to talk   https   www reddit com r Anxiety comments 5lg3o6 i cant function due to work anxiety my mind feels   Thought I'd link this rather than type it  I just spent 2 3 whole days of my break in bed worrying deeply about all the work I am behind on and how much I don't know on my job  I started contemplating my whole life and how pathetic I am  Now work starts again tomorrow and my mind is exhausted from worry   So you are not alone  I am dredding work tomorrow and just want time to stop so I can stay in bed   Thank you so much for the reply     Honestly  I really want to  see someone  but I'm scared of telling my mom that I need help  I have told her before that I have wanted help  but she hasn't done much  She keeps on asking me if I still want to seek therapy  and I say yes   I may sound like I hate my mom  but I don't  I love her  and she has done so much for me   Maybe she just thinks this is a passing thing  I think the hardest thing for me is to bring myself to ask for help  I hate asking for help  even when I most need it  I am sure my family will get involved  and my dad has told me to be confident and stop worrying and control myself  but I can't do any of that  I don't want this to be a pity party for me though  you know  People feeling bad for me is weird  Sent I experienced a variation of this during my massive anxiety attack where I was CONVINCED that I was dying   The ER docs had a mental health gal come in and try to calm me down long enough for the doc to draw blood from me  I refused to stop walking   She asked me why I couldn't sit down and I told her that I would die if I stopped walking  She asked me why I thought that and I told her "It feels like Death is tethered to me right now  As long as I'm walking  he can't keep up  If I stop  he'll catch me  But I cant outrun him because we're tied together  so I have to keep moving "  So it wasn't depersonalization of my own self  but I certainly felt as if another entity  attached yet disconnected  was a part of my situation  This is super cool  Congrats  I think it was his back molar   My mother and my family are somewhat the same in that respect  I guess if you don't suffer from it  no matter how hard you try   you won't understand  I mainly keep quiet about my issues because my father doesn't think OCD is real and my mother thinks one day I'll just stop    I'm also with you on asking for help  I find it hard  It makes me feel weak and like I can't cope    but it is needed  Don't think of it as getting help if that makes you feel uncomfortable     Think of it as ripping off a band aid  The band aid being the diagnosis  Just knowing will make you feel so much better  Although I highly suspected for a while  I never let myself properly believe it although I KNEW     But once a doctor officially sat me down and said "You are suffering with OCD"    It felt like someone had poured cold water on me on a hot summer day   This had some great points   Hi  I mean this respectfully and do not mean to dismiss you at all  but would it be possible to update your doctor with exactly what you wrote in your original post when you get the chance  You expressed yourself very well and provided important information that can help him help you    Antidepressants are also commonly prescribed for anxiety  Although I also have suffered from severe clinical depression  my antidepressant  and anti psychotic  has made my Generalized Anxiety Disorder so much more manageable and has wiped out so many crippling symptoms that made it impossible to function at a basic level  Well that's no fun  Hope all is well now  https   www reddit com r Anxiety comments 5lg3o6 i cant function due to work anxiety my mind feels   Thought I'd link this rather than type it  I just spent 2 3 whole days of my break in bed worrying deeply about all the work I am behind on and how much I don't know on my job  I started contemplating my whole life and how pathetic I am  Now work starts again tomorrow and my mind is exhausted from worry   So you are not alone  Sorry I have no actual advice  I am knee deep in this too unfortunately   Even though I sincerely think that what you are describing is nothing more than an anxiety spiral  I have pain which makes me anxious  I am anxious which gives me pain   go to the doctor    Even if they find that it's only Anxiety  you will be AMAZED at how effective peace of mind is when it comes to calming Anxiety  Don't go to the doctor to find out if there's anything wrong  Go to the Doctor to prove that everything is fine   That's what helped me  I was having panic attacks because I was CONVINCED that something was physically wrong with me and that I was going to die because of it  Went to the Doc and they proved I was as healthy as a 25 year old could be  Put my mind to rest and with it  my anxiety  Hey there    I know this feeling very well  I have gone to a few therapists who felt the same about me  But for some reason none of the antidepressants worked for me    Eventually  the only thing I was left with was a benzo for 14 years   I would get a second opinion  After I started mindful meditation therapy and EDMR things got a lot easier  I was actually able to do a taper off my medication and I've been free from benzo's for a good 5 months    It's not easy to control your anxiety at first and I know it might sound super cliche but the gym helped a lot  keeping a journal with things you've accomplished big and small  eating healthy and doing the things you enjoy  Remember the mind if powerful and you are in charge  You tell it what to do   First  I would talk with the doctor about a second opinion  Meds do have their place if you can find one that matches up with you perfect and for that you're going to need a doctor willing to spend time with you  Then  I would give it time and incorporate some mindful mediation and maybe some EDMR  It could be super helpful    Don't stop meds of course without having a provider help you with that and if they start to work even better  I'm still dealing with anxiety but not nearly as bad as it was before  I do a lot of writing and force my brain to focus on the present  That way it can't linger to tomorrow or the past    I hope some of this has helped   Thank you so much for your post   I am so relieved to see that I am not alone  I have extreme anxiety about death and it takes hold of me via irrational thoughts   I was recently on a cruise and could not enjoy myself at several points because my anxiety kept causing thoughts of a crash or explosion to keep me spun up  The flights to from were torture bc I was convinced the plane would crash and I would die  I am now paranoid and have obsessive thoughts that I have contracted a virus from one of the ports of call  Anxiety SUCKS   The worst part is  I KNOW the thoughts are irrational and there are always logical explanations for everything  My anxiety will not allow me to stop reacting even when I know I'm fine   Like right now I know I don't have some strange virus    I'm dizzy bc my equilibrium is still off from the cruise    It just sucks bc all my anxiety stems from the fear of death  It seems as if the older I get  the worse it gets   It's so comforting to know I'm not alone  Xoxo Yeah that's definetly true  I just wish I was enough of a presence to demand respect Very much so  Yay for dental insurance   Absolutely not  Paxil is one of the WORST offenders when it comes to overdose underdose    If you're truly not feeling an improvement with Paxil  my suggestion is to start weening yourself off now and NOT increase dosage  Paxil is one hell of a drug that REALLY fucks you up  I know from experience  and the side effects of withdrawal are   Jesus Christ I never want to experience them ever again  The brain zaps alone      Find a different drug  If Paxil isn't working for you now  a higher dose is not going to do the trick  And I would stay away from Buspar if you can  That one almost gave me a REAL heart attack  like actual cardiac arrest and not the "anxiety makes me feel like I'm having a heart attack"  Hi  Sorry to hear about your struggles  but give yourself a lot of credit for making the decision to reach out for professional help again  You're taking great care of yourself  and that's awesome   Maybe it can help when you call your doctor's office and counseling center to read exactly what you wrote out loud  I know you must be busy with your job  but if you have the chance  maybe you can also write down a list of any symptoms you've experienced  You can show your list to your doctor and therapist  It can be hard to go back for help and can even feel like a big loss  but it's not at all  This is a huge success because you're taking care of yourself    Same here    I have to make an important call too right now    You say you feel stupid  I know this thought  It seems so unbelievable that something 'small' like a phone call can be such a huge thing    But you don't have to feel bad  For people with anxiety problems something as a phone call is not easy    The important thing is don't get too stressed about it    If you aren't able to make the call right now it's okay  Do something different  take a walk or do the dishes and get back later  but not too late   Take a pen and a paper and write down what you have to say  When you are in the conversation you can use this to remind yourself what to say when you are getting stuck   And the most important part  Don't take it too seriously  If you are getting stuck  if you stutter  if you have problems to find the right word  that's totally fine and normal  The other person on the telephone probably has the same problems sometimes too   Anxiety often seems to make minor problems huge in our head  But if you keep that in mind it could help you see the reality    Hope that helps you  And don't worry you are not alone  From Dallas    You are an inspiration  Hope I can achieve inner happiness  Well first off  I'm sure you aren't ugly  and yeah I'm a teen too  well 19   And if they do that while the mum is right there  that's definitely her problem and she should do something  I don't think I could yell at them  even if the mother wasn't there  I just can't raise my voice to anyone Does exercise help    We were a species which really had to do a ton of ass kicking sweat inducing hard labor just to survive  before civilization came along with its conveniences  taking away our active lifestyles  Helps me to get the heart going  one hour of cardio stuff for 24  hours of peace  Bicycling  yard work  etc also as long as I sweat for like 45 minutes   Depending on the area  country city  you should decide to report or not  I guess you should have actual proof  like being harassed in front if people  Yeah  I have severe anxiety for going back to university campus  especially my building  When I was still a student  just a few months ago  I would finally muster up the courage to take the train over there  And I would sit on a bench for several hours  listening to music or audiobooks  Trying to summon the courage to go to my office and work on my thesis  But I just couldn't  After a few hours I'd go home and cry   A couple of months ago I decided it didn't work and I had to give up graduate school  It was a hard blow  and one I had experienced about a year ago as well  However my office is still occupied by my stuff and I need to go clean my spot  It's just so fucking anxiety inducing to go back there  the fear of meeting fellow students  people who looked up to me  people who expected me to succeed  And just the place in itself   I managed to go pick up most of my stuff and stash all my books in a closet this Christmas  when I knew no one would be around  but I know I'll have to go back someday to get it  I just want to forget the whole place  but on the flip side some of my best years was spent there  I had a great time in uni and it's just so sad that I'm left with these feeling about that place   I do find that breathing is the sort of thing where once I start thinking about it consciously  it suddenly SEEMS like this very difficult thing and can be a vicious cycle  if it were me  i would either try to distract myself with something that would require my full attention  or maybe do some calming deep breathing exercises  nope  political views differ I guess Yes  It's so hard to take my mind off of it     I enjoyed therapy  I wish I could go back  just for the talking and not having to fear to be judged  I have the same problem  For me  it was when my grandmother suddenly died when I was in elementary school that my death anxiety started   My anxiety over death manifests itself in irrational thought   As a child  I would freak out over very unlikely scenarios  For example  I would stand in the middle of my room in the middle of the night if there were thunderstorms with tennis shoes on in case lightning struck the house   It was always there  but def got to be much worse after I had my son  For awhile  I tried several different meds prescribed by my doc  They helped stop the obsessive thoughts  but totally altered my life  I have ZERO ability to be aroused  even after being off of them for many years  and sometimes my body does not process touch in the correct way  Example  if I lightly scratch my arm it registers as intense pain  For this reason  I chose to do everything I could to manage without the daily meds  I still occasionally use Xanax or some alcohol if I cannot get a hold on my thoughts   It seems the older I get  the worse it gets   I was recently on a cruise and could not enjoy myself at several points because my anxiety kept causing thoughts of a crash or explosion to keep me spun up  The flights to from were torture bc I was convinced the plane would crash and I would die  I am now paranoid and have obsessive thoughts that I have contracted a virus from one of the ports of call  Anxiety SUCKS   The worst part is  I KNOW the thoughts are irrational and there are always logical explanations for everything  My anxiety will not allow me to stop reacting even when I know I'm fine   Like right now I know I don't have some strange virus    I'm dizzy bc my equilibrium is still off from the cruise    It just sucks bc all my anxiety stems from the fear of death  It seems as if the older I get  the worse it gets   It's so comforting to know I'm not alone  I am going to seek out therapy since I can no longer manage this alone  If I find anything on my own or from a therapist that seems to help  I will make an effort to PM you and share  Please share with me if you come across any ideas  I am tired of feeling this way  It helps to know I'm not alone  Xoxo Grape juice    It's definitely a tough road to go alone  feel free to reach out and PM me if you need someone to talk to  What are your current coping strategies  Let me know how it goes  I was thinking about therapy too but I'm a bit skeptical as some people say it really helps and others say it's a complete waste of time  Good luck  You'll be fine    I get these sensations every so often    always freaks me out  I've learned to monitor the twinge pain if it persists  but after occupying my mind I'm usually symptom free    I read a great analogy once    our bodies are like really intricate machines  like cars or computers  Just like our bodies  these machines can overheat  rumble  or slow down a little bit from time to time for seemingly no reason at all  This doesn't indicate they're broken  dying  or wrong  rather these things just happen simply 'cause    Our bodies are intricate  strong  and very capable   it will definitely warn you of anything to be worried about  Keep an eye on things and keep yourself busy  I'm sure you'll feel these types of things more and more throughout your healthy life  so don't stress    I eat when I am hungry and hate to eat when I am not  I have been having to make myself eat more recently though because I got out of the habit of eating breakfast and lunch which ended up with me being underweight   Just asked my mom to call a therapist and she asked what I think I am suffering from  so I said OCD  She rolled her eyes and moved her head  I feel you  She'll call tomorrow  and hopefully I can talk to someone soon  She said I think you have been getting better with this  but I told her just because  I may look alright doesn't mean I am  I told her about me praying on the toilet  and she said that everyone has fears like that  It's like she's trying to help me  but it isn't working  I said  "the way I handle these fears is not normal"  I have the same thing  I got a really bad virus  my entire family did  so we couldn't help each other  I threw up like 15 times throughout the night and dry heaving  It was absolutely horrible  It's been about a year since then and I understand how you feel    When I think about these moments  and when they replay in my head this is what I do  I inhale  and while inhaling I focus on the bad thought and imagine it being tied up in a bag  As I exhale  I imagine it flying into a garbage can  then taped shut and then set on fire  It's magic because it really stops me from thinking about it  Lol  You should try something like this When I first started driving I was super confident because we started on really quiet roads  I could already drive before I took lessons and felt like I was king of the world  The second I had to start learning manoeuvres and facing traffic was when I became like you  Scared of causing an accident or holding people up    Surprisingly people are actually really considerate towards learners when they are with instructors  drivers will usually give you plenty of room  As for dealing with the anxiety side of it  I used to ask the instructor if I could have the radio on for a little background noise and distraction  It helped massively  If you are 100  focused on the driving you will be more nervous and make more mistakes  Sounds stupid but that's exactly what I experienced  You need about 2  of your mind focusing on something else to keep you calm  in my case it was the radio  hope this kinda helped   Try Ativan it works well for me If you already covered topic of hobbies then I'd suggest to do some research and learn more about her hobbies  Like that you can let her talk in depth about her interests  You can invite her for a movie and then you can both discuss the movie you just watched  Think of some interesting stories that happened to you and consider sharing them with her  You can ask her to share some cool stories with you as well  When in doubt ask her about her   Congrats on the interview    I know how you feel   I get anxiety when I go on interviews too  What helps me is remembering that they called me in for a reason  and they wouldn't have done that if they didn't think I had something that might fit for them  Also  I'm interviewing them too  in a way  to make sure that they're a right fit for me    Not that this is anxiety specific  but you could use something from another field for your current one  For example  I'm in library school right now  and I don't have a ton of experience  but I volunteer and can use that experience  customer service  and relate that to libraries   Good luck   D  Hmm If the vet didn't have ideas he might be OK  My sister has a cat that's a drooler  He's totally healthy  Just slobbery  Maybe the respiratory issue is making him drool because he's breathing more through his mouth  Hey  I was in your boat 4 years ago  Dropped out in the middle of a semester no less due to massive depression  Worked retail  saved some money and really gathered perspective on what field I wanted to be in  Went back to community college and I graduate in a year  debt free  Congrats  I hope you take this time to find your skills  passions  and find out what you want  Much better than staying in college just because someone  not you  says you should  Good luck OP  You're a great inspiration thank you for sharing your journey with us   I want everyone to be happy  both of egotistical reasons and for the other person's sake  You also went at the best possible time to D C    The cherry blossom is beautiful and everybody is happier because the city is so beautiful    I loved the video  it inspired me to get up and do more things that I enjoy but avoid because of anxiety  Thank you so much for sharing  Touched my weiner  Can confirm I have it  Seems more like a nerve ending or blood vessels   If you only sleep and play games  you might very well have back issues from a poor posture   bent forward gaming desktop posture    Apart from that  health anxiety is very common  either way it's a good idea to get an appointment with a doc  I am that friend for someone  Thank you for reminding me how important that is for some people  What did you do to overcome them  i had the same thing before  it was a stretch mark Time to grow up  What does that mean to you  My body always feels like shit when I spend too much time in bed  I did go to the doctor for reassurance though  that helped a lot  This is fantastic  I'm proud of you  Thanks mama megs I appreciate the insight on this  I was kind of worried about it  as I didn't know if it was ok to feel this or if it was the result of trauma  That makes me happy to know it's not a repressed psychological issue  As Ive been working with my trauma therapist for close to ten months to address everything  Thanks   Fenea Deep breaths in through the nose  slowly exhale through the mouth  Try about 10 in a row  Another option is to look for a good guided meditation or relaxation video on YouTube  Good luck  Thank you so much for your kind words  I wasn't able to today  but I'm gonna try again tomorrow  and definitely write stuff down  I don't even know why I didn't think of that    Thank you  again  I really  really needed that   yes I feel the same way  my resting state is anxiety  when my anxiety fades  I dont know where to even begin and start getting anxious until i reach my normal anxious resting state where I am somehow more comfortable and familiar   Yes  I hope it will  And sorry  I didn't mean to sound so dismissive  I'm genuinely curious as to what it is I seem to be missing here  I'm willing to try anything that might help  so was wondering if you'd tried it yourself or could offer further advice  Thank you  It's possible to have anxiety all day  every day  I think a lot of people on this sub have this issue  I certainly do    I don't know if it helps  but one thing that seems to help  as ridiculous as it sounds  is to talk back to my stomach  that's where my anxiety messes me up the most  and be like "oh shut up" or "be quiet it's not that bad"  When I say it out loud it helps  Usually I do this when I am lying in bed and feeling sick  my anxiety gets bad at night because my mind can wander   Hello  Im so very sorry you're going through this lately  But let me tell you  if you had an ulcer  which I do  you would know it beyond a doubt  It's hard to explain because people tell me all the time "Dont worry if you had     you'd KNOW it" even though we kind of already THINK WE DO  right   But rest assured if you had stomach cancer or an ulcer you would 100 percent know it    It sucks and is very obvious  When I get focused on just one worry  I tend to OVERFOCUS on that body part and notice every single sensation  So you might "think" you feel something but with an ulcer  I dont want to give you too many symptoms because you might start to worry yourself  you would know  I've never had one before in my life and when I started feeling this one it was like "Omg what IS THIS  It's driving me crazy it's so weird  it hurts and it feels so funny" yeah it's pretty obvious so please dont worry  You have no reason to be upset or scared  When you have an ulcer and you have stomach pains let me tell you  it's OBVIOUS  It's worse and you can't ignore it  If you can ignore your symptoms even for just a bit and they aren't really causing you significant pain or anything I would definitely say please dont worry  And I don't just mean stress  cause you can stress yourself silly  I just mean if you ACTUALLY feel something you've never felt before and you can't ignore it  That's how I found out about my ulcer  But even still im taking meds and they should be helping soon  So please dont worry  I hope you feel better love  I really hope that you can relax and feel better because I know health anxiety can really be the worst      3 Typically the sense of impending doom happens seconds or minutes before they die  You would have been dead if yours had anything to do with health issues  Just paranoia anxiety  Thanks  Helps a lot  I'll try the YouTube stuff tonight   Someone on  r nootropics said a while back that there's four main things that we can say with confidence help to improve mood and general functioning  Those things are exercise  diet  sleep  and meditation  If you can get more of those things into your life you'll have a much better foundation from which to build on and improve your life   It sounds like you sleep well enough  though if you can get it so that you spend more time awake during the day  ie  get up at like 10am or earlier  you'll probably be better off  At the very least you'll get more of your Vitamin D naturally   If you can get an exercise   meditation routine going that would help  Start slow  Headspace  phone app  offers a free 10m guided meditation which might offer a good start    Diet definitely helps  Maybe you could try cooking up some recipes  If you like it you could become good at it  and maybe it could become a hobby  It's a good skill to have regardless  and it might help you feel more confident if you get good at it   I'd personally add another thing to the list  and that's herbal tea  Specifically  relaxing ones like chamomile  holy basil  valerian root  mint  There are others as well  These can really help me turn a day around  in that I might be a nervous wreck before and then pretty chill after drinking some tea  None of them will cure you  but they definitely won't hurt  And your body will definitely appreciate them  goes with diet to some degree   Lots of teas are good for you in other ways as well   You're only 22  so you have lots of time to figure it out  And your unique life experience actually gives you a unique perspective that may turn out to be pretty useful  It's good that you're getting fed up   you should be able to use that motivation to get better  I have severe anxiety and I get that feeling pretty regularly when I have a panic attack  I've been to the ER countless times because I was convinced I was going to die  I've had my heart checked  and I'm completely fine  Being checked by a doctor might ease some of your fears  but it sounds like you have anxiety   Not really sure  but I have OCD  I think it's another type of anxiety disorder like GAD Are you able to get an erection now  To be honest  if you can get an erection at this time  and it doesn't hurt I don't  think  you need to worry about any damage to your wingwang  Also  by obsessing over your possible visual changes can make them worse  Your brain is a powerful thing    I don't think you are in any immediate danger  The doctor will probably check your heart too    The best thing you can do right now is relax and stop reading horrible possible side effects on the internet   I know it's tempting but it is terrible for anxiety  Your doctor will diagnose any problems    Good luck   Source  not a doctor  used to be pre med tho Yeah seriously  I mean  I'm over here dreading the idea this is an abscess and will get to my brain  but I couldn't imagine doing so without insurance I've gone to therapy a couple of times now but it still makes me nervous  I'm sorry this happened to you as well  I've been talking to my friends and some of them have had experiences like mine  I know it's not like getting professional help but it's a start I think     Thanks      Thanks Thank you so much for this  3 Its currently 3am and I'm laying in bed feeling super anxious and then I remembered I posted this  I really hope giving a big "fuck you" to my anxiety will make me improve  I mixed up so many words yesterday and completely forgot whatever the costumers were talking about and what I even had to type at the computer  Bascially everything   I'm just hoping I'll get used to it very quickly so I don't fuck things up and have a good experience at work  Thank you again    Mantra sounds good to me I think I'll try that too    Thank you  3  If you can concentrate on a book  i'd recommend reading  especially Tolkien or Dragonlance  Thank you so much I really really hope I will get the hang of it       Thank you  Good luck with school and in your sport    I know I'm not the only one  but I always feel that I am  I just can't seem to stop thinking about the bad things instead of the good  Plus  I keep thinking that every single athlete in the world was part of that crowd in high school besides me   I agree 100 percent this has happened to me countless times with many visits to the er  thinking "IM DYING IM GOING TO DIE OH MY GOD" and having a panic attack  Yes 100 percent  This is very common OP  Very very common with health anxiety   I've tried concentrating on books and that hasn't worked  Music is another good distraction  if you have any way to listen to some  I can't sleep without watching something or listening to an audiobook myself  It's like this for a loong time  The worst part is feeling discardable and disposable  I'm an emotional piggy bank to be drained then smashed once longer useful  Hi  Thank you  that helped   I don't know if I'm going to driving school or if I'm going to just drive with friends family  do they make "learning to drive" bumper stickers    but that's a really good tip    I love audiobooks and podcasts  and I think that might help too     Did you find that practice helped you become less nervous too   Hello  I don't have much experience with bentonite clay  but I do think that if you look it up it's actually very commonly used as a face and body mask  which is probably why you did it and saw the videos     If many people do it very often  I would 1000 percent say you should not worry  In fact there are 100s of articles that explain why it's actually a good idea to use this clay  And if they have done it and nothing happened to them  lets be honest if it did  we would all be saying DO NOT USE THIS CLAY   STOP ITS CAUSED PROBLEMS AND LEAD POISONING    Also you are correct  If you immediately felt that way then it is DEFINITELY anxiety  This has happened to me too  For example if I try a new medication  I always think "What if im allergic  " and I freak out  I think "I shouldn't try it I mean I know I have to but I really am scared" then I take the medicine and guess what  Almost EVERY TIME no matter what the medicine I get dizzy and lightheaded and almost give myself a panic attack   Why is this  Because when we are worried about something we are about to do we pay even more attention to how we are feeling after we take it or use it  the clay mask  the medicine   So of course we notice EVERYTHING even things that aren't there  So you are very very right and smart to think that it was your anxiety   Also please remember that it probably has a very insignificant amount of lead in it  Back in the day people used lead for all kinds of things daily and eventually after years of exposure developed problems  If you use a mask with even just 2 percent of lead or something  it is not going to affect you  One time  I accidentally got bleach in my mouth  just a bit  I freaked out and called an emergency hotline and the woman told me even if I drank some the most it would do would be give me a stomach ache  Remember  if a lot of people are using this product  they are   and nothing has happened  then if you use it 1 time you are soooooo very unlikely to have ANY reaction whatsoever  So I would suggest throwing it away so that you don't scare yourself anymore  but just remember how often it's praised and suggested  It cannot hurt you and I promise you  you are fine   Sorry for the long reply I've just been in your shoes before      This was not your fault  Please consider seeing a doctor  and speaking to someone   We are here  and we are listening  Thanks for sharing  I relate to your post SO MUCH  It's a little different that it's not that I don't know how to do my job  but that some of my tasks are EXTREMELY detailed oriented and easy to fuck up on  When I make mistakes  especially on this project  they are somewhat public  visible to our constituency at least   Today  I spent most of the morning panicking and crying and double checking work on my day off  I totally  totally understand how you feel    One thing I finally did today after this post was call our employee assistance program  EAP   It is free and confidential and a case manager is supposed to get back to me for a referral to an outside counselor  I think I will get a few sessions free because it's through the program  I didn't have to tell them that my anxiety was work related  You could see if your job offers some type of benefit like that  or seek outside counseling    Also  I've been fantasizing about going back to working in retail like I did in college  so I get that desire    1   You're welcome   Little kids often mistakenly think that sexual abuse was their fault  and that it was a punishment for past minor misbehavior  e g  stealing cookies from the cookie jar    Your youngest sister could really use some counseling   This will teach her that the abuse wasn't her fault   It'll also help her to recover   Your older sister should ask your mom to please get your younger sister in touch with a psychologist or social worker   A   What are your mom's main expenses   Food   Rent   Mortgage   Anything unusual  such as unusually enormous medical bills   B   Have you yet visited  r secondary survivors   Things move slowly there   Post and wait   C   Have you looked at  its sidebar  https   www reddit com r secondary survivors about sidebar  and clicked at least one or two of the links  I can't listen to music since I can't use my phone     I do not have any grandparents  aunts  or uncles   You still probably have some second or third cousins   Your mom is an only child  and so is your dad  Wow that's really messed up  No therapist should laugh at you  Maybe looking for a trauma specialist would be better if you try again  That's really terrible though  I'm so sorry to hear that  I go through the same thing where I feel like most all people hate or don't like me  It's had me paralyzed from trying online dating because I know I'm just going to have constant rejection  But you didn't fall into the trap I did and that's amazing  You even found someone you've been talking to for a while  Though things aren't clear cut  I imagine you got to where you were by going with flow  You can try acknowledging there's a part of you that's hoping to protect you and see if it lets you have more control   It sounds like there are a lot of good things happening with a new start and new career  Maybe take a moment to enjoy it and don't slip down the path I did  What a fun  impressive list      Your smile is awesome  I love it  I hope it stays on forever  Definitely not alone  And from what it seems like  talking does help  That's the reason it's an irrational fear  even though we know it's stupid to obsess about death we're also curiously drawn to it    It's one of the main reasons I hate travelling overseas too  Even before my flights I'll comb through news reports for possible terrorist threats  and scare myself  I'm strangely attracted to those air crash investigations shows too  even though it makes me feel awful     maybe it's sort of a defensive mechanism   I hope you'll feel better soon and recover from your virus     Teacher with anxiety here myself  A few things   1  Your first five years of teaching are tough  with the first year being the worst  It  does  get easier   2  Don't bring work home  Stay at school and do your grading there  I found bringing marking home always caused me anxiety   3  Find alternative ways of assessing  Not sure what you're teaching  grade subject   but there are online tools like Kahoot and Plickers that make life WAAAAY easier   4  Write mini goals for yourself  Make a check list and use it  It may even have steps broken down into smaller steps   5  Look into the Pomodoro method of getting done  When I'm feeling really anxious about a task  this approach really helps me    6  Is there any way the students could do some of the grading   7  Do you have a mentor teacher that can help you   8  Look at the TeachersPayTeachers website  It has a lot of lessons preplanned  Some are free  some are paid resources  The way I look at it is that my time is money and if I can spend a few bucks for something that will help with planning  it is worth it   9  Breathe  Remember to breathe    10  Be forgiving towards yourself  This is your first year teaching  Your admin knows this  Your colleagues know this  No one expects you to be perfect  And  it's okay to ask for help  You know I have eaten all kinds of steak and not once have I thought about vCJD  And lets be honest  if you didn't know about vCJD you probably wouldn't have thought about it either    Please do not worry  300 cases   In total  Everywhere  Even just in the US alone  That is still a significantly low number  im talking about so very very low  There are 319 MILLION people in the us alone  and when I tried to calculate the percentage of people that is compared to everyone in the US  it literally gives me such a low  uncalculatable number  Were talking about the chances of you getting it being less than 0 00000000001  excuse my math im not that good but you get the idea   Also you'd have to eat the EXACT piece of the brain or spinal cord of the cow affected with mad cow disease in order to get the disease  Did that delicious steak seem like brain or spinal cord  That lessens your chances even FURTHER  vCJD is EXCRUTIATINGLY rare     Very very rare so please do not worry    I looked it up and sure enough getting struck by lightning has the same number of people affected as vCJD  Which means that your chances of getting mad cow disease for ANY YEAR not just in your entire life but any YEAR is 1 104 200 000 that is AN INSANELY low number  You do not need to worry  It's almost impossible  Just remember how rare it truly is  Feel better and eat that steak1 I get it  completely  I often get anxious and upset immediately after climax  I panic and burst into tears more often than I'd like to admit    Reading your post makes me feel more normal  tbh  I'm so sorry you're going through the same thing I am  but you aren't alone at all and I feel better knowing I'm not either  My boyfriend and I always talk through it  he's amazingly supportive  I'm happy yours is too  If he's as wonderful as he sounds  he probably wants you to talk about it  Let him be there for you  I know mine has helped me heal so much  All the best for you dear I totally do the same thing    end up putting important things off  like bills etc   because I don't want to pick up the phone  It does help  sometimes  to write down the conversation that I want to have  Even in highschool  other people are a lot less hostile than most people think  Just be friendly and they will be friendly back  Here's my take OP   We all have certain times in our life where we feel completely trapped   Anything would be better than the current situation   But at the same time it's hard to think about consequences clearly because emotions can cause strong reactions   For you  it's likely that things have not gone well so far  and you feel that you can't fix the situation and make yourself comfortable   The problem is that you're at one of those crucial crossroads   Sure  you can go back to college  but you're there right now   It doesn't get any closer to higher education and an easier life   You have to remember that a situation change doesn't automatically lift the psychological root problems   They're stopped for a bit  but it doesn't take much to land yourself into another trap   If anything  a job is not freeing  especially ones where you have no degree or experience   The jobs you will end up finding are likely going to exasperate you in the same ways   If you do somehow find a no stress job it'll likely be something janitorial   There are very few low level jobs that aren't physically socially demanding in some way   I wanted to do janitorial for similar reasons  but I believed I was in a situation where it was OK   For you  you have the possibility to finish your degree  find a job that suits you  and you will look back on all of this struggle in a positive way   No one remembers all of the shitty anxious moments  moreso the best moments of that period of time when they look back years later   There's nothing wrong with going into class one day and just being a different person   You don't have to hold the weight of previous encounters and conversations in such a high degree   Class work is stressful  but being organized with it can do wonders   Really  it's more about calming your mind  realizing that every moment you're alive is the moment where good things happen  to change you need to accept your surroundings   This is your life   You're an adult   You will make these decisions regardless of what I say   I just think that you need to see the situation without your stress attached   I hope everything works out  I thought about this too after eating beef a few weeks ago  Googled it and found out that getting mad cow disease especially in the USA is impossibly rare  And it doesn't show up for years anyway after exposure  So if you're feeling funny after eating beef  it's not from mad cow  Jesus Christ bro  that's extra heavy  Thank you so much for the long reply and sharing your story  I'm really glad you haven't had any attacks in over a year  good for you man  I totally understand what you're saying when you say that something isn't quite "right " That's how I currently feel right now  It's an extremely off putting and bothersome feeling  It's strangely dissociative  I do not feel quite like myself  I really hope with time this gets better for both myself and for you  Best of luck man  have a nice night   Its all about baby steps  If a baby step works out you get a bit of confidence  if a baby step goes wrong its only a little thing  Its like going to a casino and only betting a small amount each time  less risk   Gl I have a back to school anxiety thing going on and it has been two days    I have trouble sleeping while being anxious as well  so comment to see people's solutions There's different levels of SA  I'd say I'm in a similar boat  I much prefer one on ones than anything with more than 3 people   One thing that I try to keep in mind is that language naturally puts constraints on the way we think  and it seems appropriate to mention it here  "Social anxiety" tends to have an encompassing label when we hear the words  but really everyone has it to some degree  Traveling alone is awesome  You get to do whatever YOU want to do at whatever pace you want  If you stay in hostels with other travelers  people are always up for going out to eat  or going sightseeing together  Or you can decline and do those things by yourself    I like traveling with others  but I also enjoy being alone    So traveling by myself works out   Something I want to say  high school doesn't matter  Now I'm not saying to drop out  not by any means  what I am saying though is that once you're out you'll see how the world really works  especially when you get a job   Literally every job I've had  4  the coworkers have been really nice  they care about your work ethic more than your awkwardness  And if you have a good work ethic people will naturally want to talk to you  Trust me on this one man  I'm not the first to say it but there's a  lot  more to life than high school  You're welcome  good luck with everything  I used to do this  nowadays I'll purposely look like an idiot and have fun doing it  It's almost a fail safe  if I ever do look back on my stupidity it was all in good fun anyway   My fingers are crossed for you too man  best of luck to you  It's very rare  but stress ulcers do exist  You are far more likely at 22 years old to have a ulcer than stomach cancer  Stress ulcers can also be called gastritis  Anyways  listen to your doctor  Work with him or her with a plan of action  Quit the alcohol  spicy food  fatty food  caffeine and smoking  Start meditating or some other relaxation stuff and eat stuff that soothes your insides    Good luck  Stomach issues sucks  But again  stomach cancer at your age is super rare  You will be fine   This post spiked my anxiety big time too  My anxiety gets worse around nighttime  Do you have access to a computer  If so  I'd say turn on something light to watch like videos from YouTube or Netflix if you have it  If not  there's two options  journaling and meditating  Write down what you're anxious about and why  but make sure to keep these notes positive  That's crucial to help make sense in your mind that everything will be ok  which is the truth  Then try meditating  It's not a difficult process  Since you can't use your phone for a meditating app  just try to focus on laying down  Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth for a little while  then return to normal breathing  After that  listen to the sounds where you are and focus on how your body feels  Then count your breaths while feeling your stomach rise and fall  and then open your eyes after a few minutes of that  Hopefully something will help  Would be awesome One thing I want to add is that our language  and really all languages  constrain the way we think  words are finite when life is anything but  "Social anxiety" has such a strong connotation to it  personally I try not to think how 'bad' my SA is and in turn it almost goes away completely   There's a great book that helped me a lot when I first realized I had SA  it's called "The Wisdom of Insecurity" by Alan Watts  He talks about this for a chapter  I recommend it to anyone who wants to improve themselves  Does anyone really have a friend like that though  Thank you for your support   I greatly appreciate it   I just   I'm terrified that If I do nothing this guy   this opportunity will slip between my fingers   I know it's ridiculous of me to think that   I do not have unilateral control over the events of my life   But that's how it feels   I want to contact him again     But even doing that makes me scared  Thank you so much for your reply  I'm so glad I found this sub  it's like I've finally found a group of people who understand  I cannot tell you how much your comment helped me  No matter how many times I reassure myself that I'm overreacting and that it's just anxiety  it means so much more hearing from another person that I'm not crazy  I totally related to everything you said  my first thought was that I was allergic to the clay and I would react the same way if I got bleach in my mouth  And you're right 1000   the chance that I got lead poisoning from the one time use of a product that tons of people use everyday is highly unlikely  Just needed to hear it from someone else  Thank you so much  I wish I could give you a hug  I know how you feel  Just breathe  All you can do is breathe   Hi OP  you did nothing wrong  If you have anyone in your life you can talk to  please do  If not  you can talk to me   Nice job  Cheering you on from the USA  I think 300 cases in the US for sCJD and like 4 for vCJD  but it still has me shooken up  whatever I found in my food was probably dime sized  kinda hard and white  not sure if it was gristle but it still has me worried  I try to look at things from a statistical stand point but its so hard to not think negative thoughts on this They should be  by the state   Everything will work yourself itself out you just got to get out of your comfort zone more  About feeling like your the only one who hasn't done a lot of stuff plenty of people are in similiar places and you would never know  I actually almost dated a girl that's a sophomore at my school who had never dated anyone  You never know and even if they have done other stuff as long as they get along with you they will most likely not give a shit and if they do then they aren't worth your time  College university gives you opportunities to fix your anxiety you just got to use them  While it is true that there are certain things you could have done differently that would've not let this happen  it doesn't mean that it is your fault  It does not excuse him from going against your will  Even if he was drunk  you said NO  He was the one who didn't listen  He is the one at fault  not you  Additionally  you're following me around from a conversation about abortion from several days ago   Grow up  this isn't the sub for it  Saying someone deserved being molested is fucked up  Best of luck to you in the new year  and congrats on finishing school and getting your own place   Those are both huge achievements  especially when you considered your OCD to be completely unmanageable only a few years ago  Glad that you're doing better    Thank you  As unfortunate as it is  I am glad to see other people know what I'm talking about because it's more than just flashbacks   it's that awful  terrible feeling after orgasm  I think I posted this half for some advice and half to see if anyone else in the world knew what I was talking about  So thank you for your words  How about trying one of the gifs that shows you when to breathe in and out  Like this  one  https   31 media tumblr com b1406ea40336dc68e5404b380c391d96 tumblr nsj9tcMOgY1qkv5xlo1 500 gif  Not anytime of the night but someone that will text you back most of the time and they happen to be a night owl like me maybe   I'm so sorry this happened  It's very disappointing to look forward to a therapy appointment and finally vent what you've been holding in and then that opportunity gets taken away from you  I would suggest writing down everything you want to talk about on paper  not only to get it out of you like you might have in therapy  without input back   but as a reminder to discuss these things at your next appointment  Best wishes   Thank you    Hey there  You sound to be making a lot of progress with your anxiety issues  I too live outside Philadelphia and have dealt with anxiety issues since childhood that have reemerged and worsened since I started and now finished college  Just starting to frequent this sub  I'm also a massive Star Wars fan  Did you enjoy R1  Best of luck to you  Please consider that he is probably doing this to other girls   I understand about not wanting everyone to know about it but maybe you can find another way to "tell"   Maybe write an anonymous letter to his boss or to the police so there will be some suspicions raised and maybe someone will notice something is "off"   Edit   Forgot to say you're very brave for writing out what happened     I hope you find healing and able to receive the right kind of care   What he did was HIS fault   There's no shame in anything you've done and if you never report him I don't blame you for that either   What time did you have to get to times sq for NYE   I've lived in the DC area for my entire life  including uni  As a Black second gen immigrant  I have to be extra vigilant re  safety  Classes are cancelled on inauguration day  so I plan to stay in my dorm room  which is a confirmed bigot free zone  Inaugurations are always hectic here but this one will be just too much   That sounds like a very good experience   I spent this NYE with a bunch of friends and strangers  I have never had more fun in my life   It certainly beats last year when I waited to see the fire works through the bedroom window and fell asleep  Ditto the year before   I'm spending 6 months traveling across the US and reconnecting with old friends now  This is partially to force myself to completely get rid of my sa  the worst is when driving I notice my hands are super sweaty then I get anxious about my ability to handle the wheel in an emergency situation   thank you so much  i honestly really appreciate displays of empathy even if they are online  It means a lot  I wish you all the best and if you ever need to talk I'm here for you    Although I want to have someone to talk to I just don't have a clue what to talk about with them  To me that's the most frustrating part and why I can't keep in contact with people  Here's one more  "I'm totally independent of the good or the bad opinion of others"   Don't stop  Role playing  and going through the process in your head multiple times will make it feel natural after a while   When you make one successful call  your confidence will build up  And think about good enough  and not perfect calls  And improve from there   I still think you got this  Don't stop now  Thank you  thank you very much  I will share the article with her father as well   I can completely relate to this  If you ever need someone to talk to  feel free to PM me    I honestly dont know if friends like that exist  would be awesome though  I kind of had a roommate like that in college  but it was mainly bc he would never sleep and text me random texts while i was sleeping  I miss that canadian bro Pm me and we can talk  I'm 23 male  Definitely agree  though I was so friggen bummed out today from it   2 hours  and only got just shy of  7   Hopefully tomorrow evening goes better   At least I got a ton of great pokemon in pokemon go   P Benzo's are way to extreme on the comedown for me   Did you notice comedown anxiety on phenibut   I've considered trying that at the right dose and as a one off on special occasions   It seems to get mostly positive reactions when used correctly  I don't have advice but I have a lot of sympathy  It's the same here  My worst anxiety trigger and my strongest anxiety symptom are the same thing  I know it's not a good thing to be uninformed  but I don't keep up with a lot of political news  After 9 11 people were scared for their physical safety and their lives  Are there indications that this election outcome is going to threaten people's safety and their lives   Genuinely asking  Thank you  It has given me a new lease in life  I think it is here to stay  Yes  this is wrong to say  as it's victim blaming   I understand what you are attempting to say  but this is not the forum for it   No one "puts themselves in a position" to be raped   There are many girls and women who go out  drink  do drugs  and are not sexually abused   That is the expectation any woman should be able to have   Thank you to those who reported these comments  Look up derealiztion it could be that  I have it   Hi Sadgirlssclub   As FO wrote  the only way we can completely protect the forum is by making it private or 18   neither of which is a good solution   It only makes it more difficult for those who need it to gain access

a lot to take it  I don't have much advice  but I told myself that when I leave work  I have to accomplish finish a task  Correlating and reflecting my day on something positive helps me get over the fear of something going wrong  I hope that helps   It's not anxiety  You're a normal person who doesn't know what they want to do with their life  Give college a try  You'll meet new people and have a whole new experience than you're used to in high school  While you're there maybe you'll realize what you want to do with your life  You'll have a better chance of getting the type of job that isn't 9 5 if you have a college degree   I relate  I feel bad turning down the invitations to parties  but feel worse going to them and not feeling comfortable and leaving early  The cycle ensues Thanks  it helps just to know that I'm not the only one  I mean I know I'm not  but the positive vibes certainly help   Buy a mouth guard because that jaw clenching is really hard on your teeth  If you've got good dental insurance your dentist can make you a custom one but I just buy mine at Target and throw them away when they are chewed through   though maybe I should be saving them for some sort of grim art project  Most people who have gym memberships have gone a period of time without going   People stop and start working out all the time   Just rip the bandaid off   If you're stressed  you'll start relaxing once you are working out   Exercise is awesome   Not to mention a TON of people probably return to the gym the first week of January every year  You'll be one of many  I used to get these kinds of transient pains a lot  After numerous medical workups and tests with no apparent cause I finally found relief  It turns out that taking a magnesium supplement completely stopped them and now if I miss a few days of magnesium  they come back  It's worth a try  The best one I've found is Whole Foods 365 brand magnesium   I have 1 like that  Females seem to be best for this   The answer really lies in why you don't like these sorts of events  If the reason you are uncomfortable in these situations is that you are constantly worrying about what the other people are thinking about you  or changing your behavior because of them  then it's probably social anxiety  You may have an unreasonable fear of being negatively judged by these people  which is social anxiety in a nutshell   If you just don't like noise or how the conversation is typically more superficial  then you may just be an introvert    That's usually when I get up for a few minutes  get a drink  snack  Then force myself to sit back down   And if they're still talking about the same subject  you'll have your drink and some food to keep you company until topic changes  He doesn't drool if we don't touch him so he might just need some time     I'm just worried that we will have to return him because then I would feel downright awful     Hi Kisua   There are answers to all of your questions  but if you haven't sought out therapy with someone trained in sexual assault trauma  it's going to be difficult to move forward     What I can tell you is that you can re learn how to enjoy yourself sexually with a partner you like or are in love with   It just takes  time  practice and patience for both of you   It would help for you partner to know what you've gone through  so he can help you to experience pleasure and orgasm together     Of course  I don't know your specific history  but my guess based on women I've worked with  is that you are drawn towards men you don't like because you have a need to punish yourself for what happened   Another possibility is that by going out with men you aren't attracted to  part of you is hoping you won't be drawn to doing anything sexual with them   You can say which fits best for you   Panic attacks are an anxiety response from the primal part of our brain that is trying to warn us of danger   With panic attacks though  we are being fooled because there is no actual danger in the moment   Knowing this is one step towards dealing with them and learning how to reduce them over time  If you like  I can provide what are called "grounding techniques" to help you with this   One book I recommend for women who are wanting to be sexual and having a hard time is Wendy Maltz' "The Sexual Healing Journey "  It's best used after going through recovery with a therapist  but it may be of help to you   The best thing is to keep asking  writing  and talking about what you need   Either here or with partners you trust   All my best  I think work anxiety is very common but you've also got a very high stress job  You might want to look at other options  The pressure you're describing would make me bananas  After a particularly tough gig as an autism aide I discovered that I would rather work a physically demanding job than have one that has a lot of mental pressure  Some people thrive on and even need the adrenaline of a job like sales but I think for me it would be a freaking nightmare  If there are parts of it that you like  maybe you can find a sales position somewhere more low key  Sounds like you may have anxiety  If it was really bad you could go see a doctor  If you have a cold with a stuffy nose it might make it worse because breathing right is a pretty big deal with anxiety  Just my thought   I am anxious every Monday night because I have therapy every Tuesday   During the day or evening I try to write some things down about the past week  things to discuss  etc   Focusing on therapy topics for just 5 minutes greatly reduces the amount of stress I'll feel the rest of the day night  I'm not too sure what your point is in re  that everyone has social anxiety  I agree you are correct  but SA is more typified by social anxiety that is problematic  unreasonable and atypical  It sounds like you're trying to deny you have a problem by pretending everyone else feels anxiety too  when they don't  at least not to the same degree   I conquered my crushing anxiety about my grades and specifically my classes this semester  I fell behind by almost 3 months in my robotics class but clawed my way back through seven programming assignments in one week  and even checked my transcript  I got 2 As and 2 Bs this semester  I feel that under my situation  most people would have given up and dropped out of school  and I'm really proud of myself for surviving a situation that seemed impossible  It's hard enough to get decent grades at an elite engineering school  University of Michigan  but to do it with panic attacks every time I worked on any content related to my programming classes was fucking heroic  I also managed to confront my bizarrely specific fear of checking my grades   Tomorrow I must register for next semester's classes  It is a huge anxiety trigger for me because I am in my last semester of college and I envision scenarios where I don't get enough credits to graduate and screw myself over  Wish me luck  I read something great yesterday about anxiety being when you're too focused on the future and what might happen  and rumination is when you're too focused on the past  I'm going to try managing my anxiety with meditation and exercise  Anxiety is definitely about not being in control   or really more about not being okay that we're not in control because none of us are in control  It's great that you found someone you like  Read up on meditation and maybe give it a try   Yes it does   Hi There    First off you aren't alone    I've dealt with severe anxiety for as long as I can remember    Yo have to figure out you but there is millions of people who deal with the same thing everyday    First off if you have any caffeine in your diet cut it out  Second of all don't try and hide your anxiety  tell her about it  I'm sure she will be nothing but supportive    Try to set a routine and keep yourself busy as it typically helps most people    For the times when your anxiety is out of control I suggest downloading headspace the app it's great to listen to and it should help calm you down    Last just know that you are perfectly normal and anxiety is a beautiful things  The darkest tunnels can lead to the brightest of lights  It will make your mind and spirit stronger and more creative than you could have ever imagined    Feel free to private message me    Stay strong and remember we aren't given more than we can handle   I just came to this sub looking for the same thing  I saw a few online that looked promising  specifically joyable  I don't have the money to pay for sites like that but if you do it may be worth looking into   When you're anxious your breathing becomes very shallow so try some deep breathing  Also make yourself some toast  I don't know why but toast is comforting  Is it anxiety  I have the same issue related to coffee  acid reflux  and post nasal trip  It's aggravated during certain seasons too  Honestly I keep finding myself coming back to the comments just to remind myself that I'm not at fault and the guy really is a piece of utter shit and that I'm not just imagining things  Funny how a single event unfolds into being fucked up for a while   Thank you  I'm really hoping it goes well  I'm kind of the same  I think about my loved ones dying all the time and makes me feel so upset I get anxiety  Whenever I read about a person dying in the news I imagine it happening to my family and it deepens my depression  The thing is that I do it to myself and I try to control myself from doing that  I had to unsubscribe from many news feeds just so I'd stop imagining my loved ones dying all the time   Hi kali   It's difficult to give you any really helpful answers   I will say knowing is always better than not knowing when it comes to a history of sexual abuse   Especially when it's affecting you in ways you aren't certain of   If your mother has answers that may help you understand things better  than it will be better for you in the long run    That said   without the support of a therapist or at least a support network of friends trusted others who can be there for you  learning more details may have a short term impact on you that could be very difficult to deal with   I typically recommend to my clients that we increase sessions or other supports to ensure that getting new information won't cause more disruption in their lives than they are capable of handling   You are clear about your history of depression and addiction and I'd hate to have this spiral from your control  assuming it's under your control now   There are some alternatives to therapy if you cannot afford it   One would be seeking out a therapist who will do some pro bono or drastic sliding scale work with you   Others would be utilizing ad hoc supports like RAINN  a chat forum like pandys org  or here   7 Cups of Tea is a moderate choice as it's not done by professionals  but can provide free support when you need it   I'll be honest that this work is best done with a qualified professional and I wouldn't want to set you up to destabilize if you don't have the supports in place to take in whatever your mom has to tell you   I'm sorry I can't be more decisive  but hopefully this will give you some guidance in how to approach this   All my best    You're totally right about this one IMO   Since you guys are bringing it up though  I will say this   the "fag" issue may be manifesting itself because you are worried people see you that way    If you can learn to not care if someone calls you a "fag"  you will be a lot happier   Maybe that means that you have to face some fears related to it    in my opinion everyone is somewhere in the middle   this realization helped me a ton when dealing with similar fears  At a minimum  this is something that I would run by your psychologist   Ive never tried meditation and to be quite honest I don't completely understand it  Would you mind telling me about how you meditate and how it works  I'll do that  Thank you   I will  My therapist gave me her phone number as a means to contact her or ask questions   Thank you so much  I really needed to read something like that  I really appreciate it  That's some good advice  thank you  I'll try that next time I'm in a similar situation I think they have moments of inaccuracy  if you are talking about the wrist ones  Mine would have moments where it would spike to 150 or something crazy while just sitting down  and my heart body felt normal the whole time I actually brought it up to them today because it's just impossible for me to manage on my own at this point and because of that I now have to pay for college  my car  and my phone if I want to keep going to KU  If I move back home they would continue to fund my education  So that didn't go well   I don't understand why I'm being punished for needing help    You're most welcome  Don't hesitate to reach out    I'm a psych major and I was actually looking into EMDR a while back so I might try to find a therapist who does that  When my parents made me come home the therapist I was seeing was not beneficial at all so I've been hesitant to try again  I also don't think I was ready to talk about any of it at that point either   She gets how i hate parties and she doesn't want me to have a bad time but I don't want to force her to stay home or make her leave her friends just because of me  I stuck out the night for her   Hey  had some similar issues   Have lost both parents   dad died when I was in high school  mom died about a year and a half ago    I used to have anxiety about losing my mom  and after her passing I have definitely had worsening symptoms and constant thoughts about mortality and circumstances about her death    The advice I can give comes just from my own thoughts and kind of how I've dealt with things  death is part of life  our finite time here makes life special  and we never know how long any of us have   Spend time with the ones you love  call them  do things with them  make great memories and make the most of the time you have together    I also have found comfort at r death   might be worth wandering over there   Some good suggestions on that site  I used to suffer from crippiling anxiety  during a panic attack my partner would sit me down and read  online  symptoms of anxiety panic attacks  and then get me to write down what I was feeling and compare   Works from multiple angles I'm not really doing it yet  just researching  but the idea I think is that you learn to focus and calm your mind  I'm starting with this breathing exercise   http   mobile nytimes com 2016 11 09 well mind breathe exhale repeat the benefits of controlled breathing html    Then I'm hoping to get a good meditation app on my phone  It's my understanding that when you meditate you focus on a word you repeat and block out everything else  I get this  Kids are more frightening that adults because they will be more overtly disrespectful to you  If they don't like you  or don't want your attention  they aren't worried about letting you know  or don't care if you know about it   Not only is it unpleasant having someone be rude to you  there are often people around to witness it which is all the more embarrassing    I was once at party where there were kids and this kid pretty much realised I was the weakest socially  and harassed me to get laughs out of my mates  It was humiliating and infuriating    Also this http   www holisticonline com Pets pets 5 ways to meditate with your dog htm Id rather have the ONE friend  i only have ONE friend right now  and he has some kind of mental problem  its like extreme adhd or something  its tough to explain  hes totally different from other people  idk what exactly it is bc ive never asked and i never will ask  but after going through cancer AND chemo  he was the only dude there for me  besides family  and not even all of my family was there for me  i learned through cancer i have NO friends besides him  And i can never repay him for that  The only bad thing is is that we cant have those deep conversations just bc of his mental ability bc his 12 year old little brother is literally smarter than him  hes 26   A true friend is priceless tho  Hes the only one ive ever had I'm sorry this happened  Keeping up with reporting and blocking seems to be the best solution    I wrote out a story asking for advice  I got a creepy message  I ignored it and deleted my post immediately   Its always been difficult for me to have female friends  But youre right  they are best for that  not to be sexist but my past experiences show its true   I either become attracted to them and then they talk to other guys and i get pissed or they get attracted to me and i talk to other girls and it never ends well  They always want to have sex eventually and i dont want to  mainly bc one had herpes  but thats a whole different story  and they get pissed or turned off bc they think i think theyre not attractive  Ugh  just so complicated   Some of those would bother me too  You're not alone  Today my gf breathed onto my dinner and I had to throw it out but she didn't understand what she did    Other people aren't going to get it unfortunately  It definitely makes it go away to an extent I won't lie  Not completely  but eases the symptoms a bit  Pinched nerve  Get up and stretch and walk around a little and see how it feels  the nausea you're feeling is almost entirely anxiety  and maybe because of your diet  You'll probably never vomit unless you come down with a stomach virus or food poisoning  but try not to obsess over that  Hopefully he will get acclimated soon  He'll probably be harassing you to pet him soon  just like my cat      Distract yourself with happy videos  things that will make you laugh    Are you thinking about taking a trip   Do some daydreaming about that   Yes  It makes you not care and feel dead inside   Maybe I'll start implementing them in my diet  or maybe start to eat more spinach  But I thank you for your advice  In a similar situation  Great to hear good news for someone   Will do  Muscular pain from constant video games   I actually did the exact same  I'm surprised I'm not the only one  p That explains it i have been laying down since new years a lot   Magnesium acts as a muscle relaxant and most people are deficient in magnesium  It can be difficult to get enough through diet  I originally took it for anxiety on advice from a book about natural anxiety treatment since I don't tolerate psych meds well and it had the side effect of clearing up the dull ache and sharp  transient pains in my chest and sternum  Worth a try  I went without dating anyone until age 20    I'm not sure if you want it but some advice I know works is to put yourself out there  The longer you wait the harder it'll be  Somebody somewhere will see you and be interested in it   Yes this happens to me all the time I second guess everyone and wonder if they are telling the truth and I keep asking and asking for reassurance that they are not lying to me  In that case  I'll definitely look towards supplements  I actually bought some not long ago  They're 250mg  but I'm not sure exactly how much to supplement  if I'm honest   Edit  says one tablet daily with meal  That works  haha  When I get like this I like to use that energy for something  You need an outlet    I see you said you can't workout because of dizziness  However that energy can be used elsewhere that dosnt require something physical  For me I play FPS video games  The adrenaline I get from the anxiety helps me in the game and when using that energy it eventually fades and I become relaxed    If you don't like video games you can just apply the same thing to anything else  Take a bath  But instead of just taking a bath clean the tub first  really well  Then reward yourself    Breathing in a paper bag helps too  Focus on your breath and calm your breathing    Hope something works  I feel ya   If you're a girl then I'm down lol It is NOT your fault   It was sexual assault    I just wanted to say that I totally relate to this  It's a kind of covert anxiety that as an adult I've managed to learn to hide over time  I love it when people are like "you're not anxious" and I just want to say "oh yeah  Then why does my brain keep telling me that something important is on fire somewhere all the time " I really do hope so    Take melatonin  or if you don't have any Benadryl  You'll be put like a light    Remember too if using your phone before bed to turn the brightness down or change the settings to night mode  This will help the brain relax and not be so stimulated   Read a book or graphic novel  It took me 10 weeks to read the first walking dead because I would read it before bed and not last 5 mins lol    Hope something works  I feel ya   I take 400mg a day  The only side effect to magnesium is that it can loosen your bowels a bit  so I'd recommend taking it when you'll be home until you know how it'll affect you     I'm not religious but if I don't pray every night or do a cross three times   EXACTLY THREE TIMES  whenever anxious something really bad will happen to me  Well you're trying to solve your problem with the wrong shaped block here   Your way of thinking goes "success   no anxiety" when it should go "no anxiety   success"   You have to find out why you are getting this anxiety in the first place  Talk to a therapist  You won't believe how much just talking will do   I feel like you're adding a lot of weight ontop of already a substantial amount of weight by pin pointing and amplifying when you see yourself do something wrong  You need to take your mistakes and improve on them and not beat yourself up about it    Hope you find something  I feel ya    7 for 2 hours  Sorry to hear that man  Is that a rare thing though  I don't know cause I live in a fairly tourist heavy place  I found myself just checking the surge maps throughout today  even though I had no intention of driving  Addicting me  just like a video game  D  Well  there's already been a pretty well documented outbreak of violence against minority groups following the election  In terms of his presidency    I mean  he advocated for so e pretty reprehensible platforms  so I guess it depends on how you feel about mass deportations  national registries  and nuclear proliferation  Pretty much every SAers success story  Good for you  I read an article today about how "luck" happens to those who try new things and meet new people  Definitely favors extroverts and well  people who don't stay at home on the weekends  Something for everyone on these boards to keep in mind this new year  incl myself  Has something happened in your past when you were a child  Something that traumatized you    I feel like you are easily influenced by traumatic images  While yes what you saw is traumatic  realize you are now applying something that never has and probably never will happen to your everyday life    You should use the information productively and remember it for educational and safety reasons not so much focusing no the negative impact of it   Hope you find something  I feel ya   yes   reading before bed does the trick  Yes  i did try it and I am grateful   it did help me process some past unwanted closeness  rape  and to overcome the compulsivity eventually  I am still doing it   with some memory pictures  imagined or on photo    partly with some abusive fmily members of mine and partly with pictures of body parts  I do believe in it   But for that I had to read some articles on eye movements during dreams    called REM and also about how eye movement and the brain memory center is linked   And Nicolosi mentions left brain and right brain  rational verbality and emotional nonverbality  balancing in this context  which also sounds persuasively  Keep it PG GG to that buddy  Keep it up I don't know what counselor you mean  I sure had few therapists but to be fair   here there isn't really good professional help in the field of mental illnesses  you're insane  go to asylum  or just have pills and be done with it   that is basically what approach I ever got from doctors  If you mean school counselor  I am really not sure if our colleges have one and don't just relly on outside help  Also helps me not overthink so much and keeps me in a positive mind set  Stick to the indica strains or higher CBD strains  This is important because strains high in THC can just increase your anxiety  Microdose or in other words take a hit and chill  Good luck I've had to learn  the hard way  of course  that a cult ure routinely

"massage" the brain so that it responds more quickly to psychotherapy   Yea according to Dr  Google  everything is cancer haha  I've been there don't worry  But I would look into those three things   First off take a few deep breaths and relax  Slow things down a bit  Your mom doesn't hate you  Think about all of the times she has loved you and then argue with your intrusive thoughts  They dont control you  Your mom is not going to hate you over your preference of video game   I guess what I was saying is that saying that you can have SA even if it's minor  It doesn't have to be typified if you don't want it to  you kind of make my point when I said language puts constraints on thought   Yes it's a problem when you have more extreme forms of it   which it doesn't seem like OP has  but to say that "pretending" everyone has it  that's where I don't understand where you're coming from  You said you agreed with me yet you also say my thinking is an excuse   All I meant to say is that instead of thinking that you don't fit in with other people because of your insecurities  you can get some comfort from knowing that everyone has this feeling  SA or not  It hurts when someone doesn't quite understand  especially when it's someone you expect to  I also know what it's like to feel like a burden    Over the past couple of years or so I've tried to focus on forgiving other people  as well as myself  I don't like to talk about my trauma  but when I do the reactions are rarely as strong as I'd expect  I think the people I've told don't know how to best handle it  so they do their best to show they care with the "oh  I'm sorry" routine   I also try to remember that my trauma is unique to my psyche  biology  and upbringing   what happened and how I feel is valid and important  This helps me feel like less of a burden   As for your doctor visits   I've totally been there  too  Sometimes I'm very honest  sometimes I don't give every detail for fear of the repercussions  Again  I try to forgive myself when this happens and remain optimistic that this is a healing process  It takes time    I still believe I'm a better  stronger person despite all that's happened  Thanks a lot I will definitely do that    I took the same dosage for a little over a month and it would help when I took it but my tolerance began to build and long term it made my anxiety tremendously worse  and it was miserable trying to get off of it  to the point of not being able to leave the house for days    Everyone's different though I suppose  I agree that it's probably best to use it as a "safety net" of sorts   Me too   Stress can cause ulcers  Irritation can cause ulcers  Many things can cause ulcers  Just because you have an ulcer does not mean you are deathly I'll  Avoid acidic foods for a while  be nice to your tummy   I've always been an introvert  and a lot of social interaction stresses me out and tires me easily  Perhaps not talking to others isn't ideal by society's standards  but it has to be okay  Some of us need a break from the inundation of small talk  It isn't imperative to talk to people  especially if you don't want to    That being said  it's good to have people there for you  I talk to only my closest friends when I'm anxious and stressed  and sometimes that helps   There is no multiplicative nature to radiation exposure and your phone  You will be fine  I ask my wife to do stuff like this but I don't think she understands  I get crazy anxiety that I'm going to sound like an idiot or fuck something up  You're not alone   Hello everyone  I've had anxiety for a long time  I guess   Probably since early childhood  May have come from a stressful overbearing and heavily controlled upbringing combined with constant bullying in school  or somewhere else   I don't know   I don't necessarily think mine is all that terrible   I have random panic attacks that wake me up on rare occasions  a few times a year  tops   and anxiety attacks while dealing with triggers  driving places i'm not certain about  phone calls to non friends family  anything super official legal  and walking alone in the dark   or traveling alone in general I guess   But aside from the rare breakdowns when I don't take my vitamins and get the idea that everyone secretly hates me  i'm naturally lacking in vit D  sadly   my day to day life is pretty easy i'd say  and anxiety stays pretty mild   But anxiety is still anxiety  and in the absence of any other ideas  my doctor says it must be the cause of my physical disabilities  Recently was put on Zoloft but had such severe side effects that I only lasted 3 days on it before I mustered up the nerve to call my doc and she told me I needed to stop taking it right away  So  That was something     My anxiety plan involves trying to strengthen my body  and therefore my confidence  as much as I reasonably can with better workout ethic this year   so far successful  11 miles biked yesterday  5 today   I also plan on trying to schedule a few therapy appointments before my insurance runs out in less than 4 months    I have to try to psych myself up for doing that tomorrow so I can get in    I do wonder if poor sleep could be part of my issue  I tend to take hours to fall asleep and wake up at least once during the night   This year   I intend to finish the book i'm writing  I also hope I can go visit my friend in another state  but that would require going to some of the busiest airports in the country alone   One of my worst nightmares       If only I could teleport  haha    Do it  It helps  A lot  Like   A   Lot    Haha  For real  Best decision i made  Probably need to head back   i wake up every night around 3am feeling like i can't breathe  i'm saving up for a weighted blanket  if my boyfriend is next to me  he rolls over and lays across the chest  i've never been a great sleeper but the night anxiety is a direct result of my job  i've started having panic ridden dreams as well  my boss is unpredictable and often makes me feel inadequate for things that were out of my control  he's also petty and passive aggressive to the point when other employees have to stop him and tell him to let it go and stop bothering me with stuff   as in made a small mess up that i rectified immediately with no further issues two months ago and he still teases me about it    anyway  my therapist suggested i try taking my medication in the morning instead of at night  we think it might be waking me up when the slow release pill starts releasing    my suggestion   if you can't handle the stress and it's making your life miserable  there is no shame in trying to find something else   something you can do with pride and that will not affect you like this   Oh I see  Thank you for explaining  Oh man  Zoloft was awful for me and I only tried it 3 days before my doctor told me I needed to stop right away  Those side effects   Unbearable  I just rocked back and forth all day and stared at a screen  accomplishing far less than I otherwise would have       Never trying SSRIs again  lol   I seem to be having some luck and controlling anxiety with my multivitamin   an additional vitamin D chew as well as daily exercise  I've also been thinking about getting some kind of calming scent plugin for my bedroom  Maybe something like these ideas would work for you   Would recommend not getting high anymore  though  Some people say marijuana helps  but at least as many say it hurts  increases their anxiety   Thanks so much for your advice  Very helpful   I just don't really get your definition of narcissism  I can't really comprehend it  Sorry   Anyway I will  Thanks for the concern   Edit  Do you mean taking things personally  Jealous    My anxiety automatically cancels me out of the dating world  No guy would  or should basically  want to date a nervous  depressed  weirdo like me   Yup    Every day I think I'm going to be fired  I suck up at work so hard and never stand up for myself  I don't ever want to cause conflict and let everyone trample over me so they won't get me in trouble    I don't know how it's possible to maintain a career and a job and how people do it    I was fired twice last year   Well you said about becoming like your mum and not being able to feel guilt or remorse right  That's impossible for anxious people because our senses of guilt and remorse for things we haven't even done minor issues are already off the scales  The losing touch of reality becoming cynical and not caring about things is part of the depression that comes with OCD and anxiety disorders  It's like a protective screen that stops us from going into overdrive all the time  All the worries you have about being narcissistic or not caring about people are being reinforced in your mind by the physical symptoms of your anxiety but you aren't narcissistic because you're aware that your anxiety is affecting you in this way  does that make sense  Have you got your hormones checked out yet  Alot of these issues can stem from hormonal imbalances  I'm a guy   and I'd be happy to be your friend  I've been looking for a friend I can depend on like that as well     You don't take any medications  I could imagine how hard it would be to not be on medication to function  I take medication and it helps me tremendously  Only down side of it for me is hire difficult it is to climax during sex  Though I'm sure my wife doesn't mind    Keep up with your job though and schedule a doctor's appointment  I think you'll find that with medication it makes things much easier and can keep the constant worrying at bay easier    Remind yourself that you have done this for a year and nothing bad has come of it  Every time I have to head into the city I'm uncomfortable even with medication  But the worst case scenario within reason   of me visiting the city is better than living a closed off life    We're all rooting for you  You've made progress moving forward  Just because it's not easy doesn't mean you should move backwards   Yes  More so the driving   I'll usually end up convincing myself that I hit someone or ran over someone as I'm driving  and just can't "remember" it clearly  And so I'll come up an image from my imagination of me hitting someone to obsses on whether or not I did it   It's a rough time  But the anxiety will go away if you fight it enough  Hey crimson i like to help people and i wanna learn english completely so my english isnt good but if you wanna help me and feel alone just pm me    20 male from Turkey Don't internalize the guilt  Your ex wasn't good for you  there was nothing you could do to fix that situation  Focus on improving and respecting yourself  No one deserves to be treated as a lesser person  You are a human being who deserves love  Spend time with people where you feel it the most   Receive hugs is a better option  I feel like they have to be sick of me  Ive been leaning on some people  hard  I am scared sometimes to be alone  I have had very bad anxiety and I know being depressed all the time has to be boring to be around  I tell myself all the things youve said and just hope someday i believe them  Everything is so surreal in a sad way  it feels like he died  or something in me died  I wish he cared that i hurt so much Holy fuck Irish     From MinerAP   Dude do you

getting some pleasure or something out of another human being is rape  This is why kids need to be taught about consent in early life so using another person's body without explicit and non intoxicated permission is rape  We could teach consent because our bodies belong to us and us alone  If anyone wants to argue about giving consent while intoxicated  r philosophy and  r feminism have gone over the definitions and arguments the basics several times  This sub here is not the place to discuss philosophy  rest assured  though  philosophy logic provides  clear and cogent  https   www

abuse is that it's ok to mourn the good parts of the person  It doesn't make you weak  stupid  or sick  You're grieving the loss of what you had  what was done to you  and what you wish you had  You wish you could isolate and keep the good parts about him and that is absolutely understandable and normal  I'm proud of you for taking steps to make sure you are physically and emotionally safe by going to therapy and getting a restraining order because you can't change him no matter how hard you try  He has to change himself  All you can do is work on healing   What coping skills do you have  If you don't have many this would be a good time for you to talk to your therapist about different ways of coping  I know for me finding ways to express the trauma and get emotional support helped  Do you have any supportive friends or family you can talk to  I know that for me writing  drawing  painting  and collaging really helped me emotionally get out my feelings of the trauma  You may find that books about trauma and healing are also validating to your experience  You deserve healing  happiness  and justice and I hope you continue to move forward in your healing process   I did that with Skyrim     Specifically  which hormones  Can you post a link with information   I can feel hopeless out of nothing and cry the rest of the night  It's weird and disturbing  when I told my psychologist she said that I should also mention it to my psychiatrist to see if it could   should be fixed with meds I miss MinerAP      And not much man  finally started college  hate it  I'm growing titties and I couldn't be happier  I live every single day in existential horror wishing I owned a gun and I now play a fuck ton of CSGO  What's up with you homie    Also oh god my post history will scar you  Sort my posts by Top and see if you can find my WTF post from like two years ago   Hi there  I'm new to this Subreddit  I've dealt with anxiety for a long time  I was on citalopram for a little while but went off it cold turkey  stupid thing to do   and have been trying to deal with my anxiety without medication or therapy  which I went to for a few months but stopped due to expense   Sometimes I feel on top of it all  other times really not  At the moment my anxiety levels have been up quite a bit  night time before bed can be the worst  I'm looking forward to chatting with you all  and hope we can all help each other     http   www everydayhealth com columns therese borchard sanity break depression bipolar disorder and hypothyroidism   www calmclinic com anxiety causes hypothyroidism  Testosterone and thyroid problems are not uncommon  only way to know for sure is to go to an endocrinologist  Problems with your adrenals can cause anxiety but Im not sure if that applies to your case with SA The fastest way would be to cut off all contact  But it's also the hardest one I guess I actually was just on it tonight  I was looking my old messages  saw a conversation between us about our base being griefed and Outpost Squid  and it led me here   Yeah  I'm in college  too  Computer Science degree and all of that jazz  I am also not a fan of it   I saw that you were trans   I'm glad that you're comfortable with your identity  I'm not LGBT  myself but I do consider myself an ally   I play a multitude of games  now  Civ 6  Pokemon S M  Overwatch  Dead by Daylight  Ace Attorney       I'm also a fan of Undertale and FNAF but I swear I'm not like the rest    "Chandelier" is a great one by the same artist  It captures the self destructive feelings perfectly   Do you know where to get one  Those brief spikes sound much more like inaccuracies in data collection then actual changes in HR   Thanks for your reply  My therapist has mentioned that triangle and I am currently pulling away from it   Meditation was something taught to me from a young age as part of the religion my family prescribes to  I think it's one of the things that kept me sane through everything  Unfortunately it's heavily associated with the family so I can find it difficult to focus on it without my mind wandering to darker corners  I really should try it again though    I don't follow     I get that   It also entirely depends on what form the lead is in the clay  You can play with liquid lead all day with your hands and have no increase in the amount of lead in or body  This is because in several forms lead cannot be absorbed easily through the skin  Ingestion or in certain chemicals you can get absorption through the skin  but these are highly regulated and they likely wouldn't be able to legally sell them for use on skin     Please share the company  I'll check them  thank you very much  If you're into podcasts  I recommend listening to "Shrink for the Shy Guy" from the beginning  even if you think SA and "just shy" are miles apart  I don't want to reiterate my story although you can find a summary a ways back in my comments  however I will say that it's is infuriating that my severe PTSD is undermined because I didn't sign myself up for a war  Infuriating doesn't touch it actually  I didn't have a choice in this matter  I didn't sign a dotted line saying I understand the possibility of my life being taken from me in my own home    That being said  PTSD is PTSD  Having a legitimate diagnosis  I wouldn't wish it upon anyone and I can understand the severity of some veterans' PTSD  Just as I can sympathize with you more than maybe PTSD from a car accident  PTSD is lonely and the more access we have to remind us we are not alone and others can understand  the better for all of our healing  Its got a very low population  but its active  Within the month yet another era is going to start  Maybe you should slide in   Its funny  I'm actually using a Squid skin right now  Maybe I'll reform FIFA for the greater good of animals everywhere   Man  I'm garbage at everything  but  Computer Science  Probably because it requires minimal memorization and more problem solving  which is what I'm great at   Long hair is great  I've been growing mine out since  like  2014 and I haven't stopped  bar a trim that was a bit too long a few months ago  I still haven't reached beard level though   I'm a Reinhardt and Genji player myself  My gf also mains Mercy   and yes  we have matching icons  We play PC  though  True    I always get the sense of doom right before a panic attack  I think this is our brain and body going "wait  something's different  RED ALERT EVERYONE " I always think the feeling of doom is that split second when my  for example  average joe plumber cells put their tools down and reach for the weapons  All hands on deck type situation  It's brief  but to those of us with anxiety and health anxiety  feels terrifying    I find the only helpful thing is breathing and riding it out  and that usually helps to stop the ensuing panic attack as well  But sometimes it doesn't then you just gotta ride that out as well   I got prescribed Wellbutrin and it put me in a great place for 3 days  Then shit got way worse than before and I had to finally quit taking it    I have a very similar situation to you  Please share     And congrats  I totally feel you here  really early morning right now but I keep procrastinating going to bed because I'm to anxious  Wish I had some words of advice other than try to get to bed a lot earlier When the maps resets I'll probably get on actually  If you're gonna start FIFA again hmu I'll help out  I'm still shit at absolutely but I'll be the best animal fucker there is     And I'm jealous man  I had real long hair  but working for my Grandpa over the summer he made me cut it cause he don't hire no fucking hippies he told me  You better take good care of it      Also fuck you Genji  literally impossible to play Widow because every game there's at least one Genji just fucking shit up   Thank you for sharing this  My girlfriend is helping me with my anxiety and depression issues but she hadn't had much experience with either until we got together  We are working on a plan together for it and this will help a lot  Holy crap  yes  I'm back to throwing up and screaming while either getting ready in the morning or in the bathroom before my shift   For me  anytime I get triggered  I have multiple traumas  because apparently I'm an overachiever  I'd say it's a tightness in me  an urgency and hyper awareness that something is off  sonething is wrong   I begin to not trust anything and my paranoia gets a lot worse  heightened mostly to the area that is triggering me but also to other things   Fr my sexual trauma I start to question everything in my mind and things speed up  this happens in general  with other triggers too  but I begin to feel not in the moment but feel out of control and begin to panic   I have had panic attacks during sex  to which my husband immediately stops and asks me what I need   Does any of tfat sound familiar    Okay now I get it  My ocd makes me not understand it   Thanks so much  You're very helpful   Edit  and about your advice about getting out of my situation  then I have a plan about moving to my father after three months  I can't get out now for some reasons   I feel you there  I think I may need to get back into therapy at some point but I really don't want to  Facing the things that give me anxiety is very hard for me  and sometimes  even with therapy  I can't figure out what they are   Hang in there  if you have a good therapist it should help      Thank you for the reassurance  It means a lot  Hopefully this will past shortly  so I can get on with life  until the next issue comes along  lets be honest   You're probably right  if it was something serious i would know for sure  I really just hate the anxiety that comes with symptoms or what i think are symptoms  most of the time the symptoms probably aren't that bad but the anxiety is what really knocks you down  Good luck with your ulcers  I hope you feel better soon   There are     If you really want to go thetherapy route  finding the right therapist is tantamount   It's not abut their education  either  it's about how you feel   My therapist was actually originally my husband's  I went in totalk about his stuff  then we started couple's counselibg and then I saw him for my stuff because I built a trust   I had been seeing another therapist and it just wasn't working     A lot of therapists have bios online  or talk about their views or treatment methods   I would check around that way   My husband foubd our therapist that way and immediately clicked with him first session  in a way he'd never done with any other therapist   I'd done the same with a therapist back East      hug  good luck Relatable    first commentor is shadow banned btw  This is so me  Even when I was younger  like age 5 or 6  and my aunt would call from another country  I couldn't talk to her   Recently  I needed help making a phone call for my friend  I asked if he could call for me instead  He didn't understand why  I told him I can't make phone calls and he still didn't get it    Does anyone else keep confusing this sub and r introvert with r me irl I want to get this out somewhere because I don't know who to talk to in real life  but it's been a rough week for me  Luckily I'm on break from school but I've had a tough time sleeping because I found out this week that my sister has Hep C  I feel like it is something that I cannot talk about to people or that she doesn't want them to know  She has been an IV drug user and has abused alcohol in the past  and she is trying to get clean so she can get treatment  I am a nursing student and I know how bad liver problems can be and I just sit up at night with anxiety that she is going to get very sick and die or that she is going to give up and go back to drugs and die  I think about her  about myself and about my parents and it just makes me physically sick to my stomach  I don't know what to do because unlike some other triggers for anxiety  I feel like the threat is very real and it's harder to talk myself down from it  Thanks to anyone who reads this    I hope all will turn out okay  I'm able to get an erection  but I've been so full of anxiety  the kind you can feel and it makes your body tense  that it's overwhelming and I haven't felt any sex drive since  I also am not waking up with morning wood  I just wish this whole incident had never happened  The sad thing is    I do less than he does   Yes  me too  I have been taking baths and that does help me a little  but I'd love to see other peoples ideas  Hang in there  Well  I really had a rather bad time  I ended up sweating like a pig in my dress  there were like 10 guys with us and all they talked about was army  girlfriends  their old classmates  and I felt bad and out of place  Even my bf forgot my existence at times and he was too absorbed talking with his pals  The worst thing was having to listen to "manly" dirty jokes that sometimes were borderline offensive to women and I was forcing stupid smiles  After we went home my bf finally understood  I hope this time it stays in his head  I feel the same way  I'm 20  Even though I've had some action with girls kissing  making out etc   I'm still a virgin and never had an actual relationship  I have a couple of friends  they have girlfriends and seeing them happy together makes me feel like I'm missing out and that I've failed in life  I have GAD as well  A great hobby that helps me relieve anxiety is walking  just getting out the house and walking around the neighborhood  Running tends to make me scared and I worry about what other people think when they look at me  so I walk now  I definitely recommend that      As for crazy day to day situations  the best thing that helps me are breaks  If I'm feeling overwhelmed or stressed out  I leave to the bathroom to calm down and tell myself that my fears are irrational  and it's just the anxiety talking  I go there around 4 times a day to do this  Sometimes a feel lazy and unproductive because I need so many breaks  but it's important to remember that your personal sanity comes first  Plus  it's probably illegal for him to have them  especially if OP can prove he coerced her into sending them   I kissed my first girl at 19  She was 32 I think  We met on the Craigslist personals section  I think it was good to just get it out of the way  Next time you think a girl likes you  and it's a non school or professional setting  just ask her if she wants to kiss and then if she actually does like you  bam that's crossed off the list  And if she doesn't  just say  "Ok just thought I'd ask "   College will be better  trust me  High school is a terrible place  and everyone knows it  The people bullying you have their own personal issues and are incredibly immature  those types of people grow up to be complete losers after high school  But you have to bite the bullet until graduation  then learn from your past to become a strong  successful person  Most adults here will agree with me in saying that your life pretty much starts after high school    few people care about high school  enjoyed it  or define themselves by their high school experience  I'm a senior in high school as well  we can do this   You really could have helped somebody in trouble  You did good   D That sounds like a very unpleasant experience  You did the right thing by calling for help  although it's understandable if you felt too numb or scared to do so  I wish you and those neighbours  including the couple  all the best in healing  I can say I'm afraid of falling asleep but not because sleep is scary but because I won't be awake and able to focus on things  I crave control over all of the happenings in my life so sleep takes that away from me  I think it may actually be more apnea related became from what I understand  when asleep  your brain is in a different state and is rarely able to acknowledge that is it even asleep   Remember  no matter how bad things May seem now  they are likely not that bad  With anxiety we tend to focus on the negatives because we are afraid of them and try to avoid them  But focus on what is going on in your immediate life  What is happening right in front of you and work on thinking about that and forming your feelings around that  Trump becoming elected May lead to some crazy things happening or it may NOT  we don't know  but he is president and we will find out so sorry about the bad when it presents itself to you in your immediate life  Yeah bump to this one  This is something I am trying to overcome as well so you aren't alone  I know its a trust issue and believe it stemmed from past friendships relationships where I was lied to by two races people  I try to remember there are good people who truly want to be my friend out there  Still a struggle  If you're willing to do an experiment try this  next time the teacher tells the class to form groups and you see that your classmates are starting to approach each other don't just stand there  approach them too  Don't say anything  don't ask if you can be in their group  just walk to their side and stand there  This may be helpfull for 2 reasons  first if the other classmates see the group is already full they may not approach it and you get to stay there  second because you'll get to see what is the reaction of the other group members to your approach  Also try to do this with groups of people you've already been a part of in previous classes  they may be more accepting that way    This may not work  but I guess it's worth trying  Just don't injure yourself on purpose  in some years you will look back and realize how not worthy that was  You can even end in a weelchair  or a bed  for the rest of your life because of that kind of things   r eyebleach I am proud of you  That is a huge step  I hope the rest of your year goes well too   D There's a match out there but he has similar problems  My more successful relatonships have been with girls who have anxiety as well  Your wife not telling you doesn't mean she doesn't trust you  Rape is a very private and isolating incident for most people  it takes a lot all it courage to tell someone  like the above comment once people know someone is a rape victim that becomes their label  Maybe she has repressed the incident and put it to the back of her mind   Fact is that you won't know until she tells you  however I wouldn't recommend just out right asking her  Maybe bring it up in general conversation  it's not a topic which is usually spoken about a lot but maybe if you have read or seen someone on TV  Wait until she tells you  she may not be ready to deal with this and asking her outright about it may inadvertently cause her distress    I can imagine how upsetting it might be for you  you seem to have a very supportive and positive relationship  and you are already being supportive by asking for advice  don't think of it as something you are doing wrong  some survivors don't tell anyone   Depersonalization Derealization is a symptom you can get from anxiety  often it comes out when under greater stress anxiety episodes  Personally i think it's horrible  and i have a very hard time accepting it    Dpdr is a kind of protection  protecting you from too much external stuff  I just try to act strong and confident even though i'm screaming on the inside  It kinda changes the other persons actions towards me  Sometimes    That's perfectly fine  I went through high school being relatively shut out and I'm in college now pretty much the same  I'm trucking on through and have a few people im familiar with now   Hey  I definitely understand your take on the situation however i've thought about this even without my stress head on and I believe that this is the right decision for me  Also this is british college so it's kind of different  I wouldn't get a degree from this I'd get a BTEC  Also it's in a subject that is not really of any help to me in the search for jobs  I also definitely understand that looking for a job isn't going to be easy and neither is actually working however I feel that I'd actually be earning something from this as opposed to what i'm doing at the moment in college  Thank you for your input though  At the moment I think i'll just be looking for retail jobs to start out with    I've dealt with it for so long it's my day to day state of mind now  Sucks really bad when I get drunk and relaxed and realize how much clearer everything is  Seeking psychiatric help now so here's to hoping  I'll bring this up so thank you for the info  Thanks    I definitely know it's going to be a challenge but it's one that I'm willing to step up to  I wish you luck in your situation  I thought this was r FunnyAndSad I believe you are describing a migraine  based on what family members that get them have told me  Did it actually grow mold   I mean  that question aside  you can wipe it down with a bleach solution inside and out  take the strings off first   Don't soak the wood   Wood is naturally antimicrobial  which is why butcher block cutting boards are better than plastic   so you only imperatively need to introduce the bleach to the surfaces that the towel may have touched   The inside should be fine because it's likely an untreated surface   Still  you can spritz a little bleach cleaner in there  Now let the whole thing dry while lying face up on the floor   Then  if you have central heating  place the ukulele near  but not on top of or resting over  a heater vent   If you don't have central heating  use a small space heater  Place the ukulele there  resting upon a dry towel   Rest it on its back for a couple hours  then turn it over and rest it on it's back     The gentle heat and forced air of the heating is just enough to evaporate the moisture and dry the wood   Don't do it too quickly  or the wood might warp   After it's dried maybe overnight  or over the course of an afternoon  put the strings back on and tune it   Should be fine   Well    my mom does get them when she's stressed  She told me they got so bad at one point that she went to get checked out  but nothing was wrong  To be honest  I feel like a bit of an idiot for asking about this  but I needed to  Are you being paranoid  Quite possibly    Just  paranoid   That's a silly thing to say   This is causing you stress and pain  and affecting your quality of life   Why would it's objective rationality be the main concern   Perhaps you can find a therapist with experience on the issue  and or a support group   If it helps  when I've gone to therapy the first thing they do is explain in detail the confidentiality policy and laws   We skimmed through it  but only because it was pretty standard and neither I nor the therapist wanted to spend time on it  In your case  I'm sure they'd be able to spend the first couple of sessions going through it in detail so you feel secure and comfortable   I also chose to not allow therapeutic communication by email  because they don't guarantee security of the email and servers   It wasn't a problem  the only things I get emails about are appointment schedules and receipts  You shouldn't feel like an idiot  Your brain hurts  and you want to know why  and what you can do about it  and how worried you should be   You're being the opposite of stupid  you're being rational  Yes they do learner stickers or badges  they're different depending on where you're from  absolutely  I practised in between lessons with my dad in his car as much as I could   Definitely recommend lessons and practicing with family  Eventually the lessons will just sort of become a mandatory thing and you'll look forward to them  and at that point you know you're close to taking your test  Good luck with it all     I did that for a while but then being uncomfortable i just learnt to accept it  This can lead to health issues so I strongly suggest you don't do this   Thank you  It's just  I know I should be healthy  but there's been all these weird feelings and pains lately  and i'm so scared and confused  Everyone's got stuff wrong with them   My right side obliques are so much stronger than the left that my hips get pulled out of alignment and it messes up my left knee and ankle  but do you think what I believe is true or just bullshit   I think your concerns are unfounded  unless someone with the right skills is specifically trying to stalk you   And  don't take this the wrong way  buy you're probably way too ordinary for someone to bother   Most of us are  thanks  that makes me feel a little better Mmhm  And a lot of what I'm feeling is from anxiety  I just get overwhelmed  Also  I have no idea who you are   I honestly don't know if you're male or female   Don't even have a hunch  Not very well  My pre work anxiety starts on Friday night and tags along for the rest of the weekend     It's not constant but every hour or so my mind starts racing  flooding me with thoughts about tasks I need to solve at work  And it's usually the same when I'm trying to go to sleep  Which is fine  You don't need to be okay right now  You will be okay again later  I will  And getting some sleep might help me  because I haven't gotten any at all  So  thank you again     Yeh this is great for someone who has no idea how to help someone through a panic attack  Even if you don't have a partner  this could help a friend or a family member   I am so sorry this happened to you   It is not your fault  it is theirs  If u are in the US  I believe this would be considered statutory rape   If so  you may be able to prosecute  In any event  do get some help   Stay strong   Aw thank you  this Fantastic to hear  I'm traveling through Europe at the moment  Day 9 out of 32  and my anxiety has been dreadful  This is so inspiring    so fucking true The same thing happened to me  I stressed after I read that post  Convinced myself next time I felt that feeling I'd be dead  Lets all just take a moment to appreciate the existence of cereal   Thank you  I'll start this immediately  I completely understand it will take a while  but that's fine  I just need to do something about this  Thank you again  Inboxed you    i also had a lot of anxiety about traveling alone  the thing is you never know what you can do until you try  if you love to travel  some part of you does enjoy being in unfamiliar places   that's what traveling is  and honestly despite my fears  doing a 2 week overseas class through my uni literally changed my life  even tat short a time overseas on my own just completely opened up my world     Congrats no longer new guy   Thank you  This also teaches you how to live in the present reality  and not be caught up in the illusory future   I'm sorry that you're feeling this way  A lot of the feeling like you don't know no you are can be a part of the BPD  I have it too   and honestly I can wake up one morning and want to do one thing  and by the afternoon I'm feeling like I can't do anything  It's unfortunately all apart of the disorder    Are you seeking counselling or anything  Feel free to inbox me if you need support    Sorry  tried to reply in the proper place below but my computer's acting up    I know  right  It's the last thing you want to be told when you're feeling like hell with terrible OCD   'Just make a bunch of lifestyle changes you totally don't feel like doing right now and you'll get better'  There were days when mine was at its worst I couldn't do much except just lie there  shaking and crying  literally unable to get up or concentrate on anything  or think about anything except the fear  It wasn't easy to keep doing the healthy things I knew I ought to do  With exercise and stuff  it got to the stage where I would pretty much go do a workout video in my living room when a panic attack hit  and think sarcastically 'Wow  it's not like this is instantly making me feel better  but it's sure nice to have something to do while I panic '  I was pretty cynical  It's just that when you get to that fight or flight adrenalin stage  sometimes you do feel better if you literally run about and burn off all those stress chemicals   it's what your body was designed to do in that situation  it's harmless and it works  So yeah  I get what you mean about feeling hopeless  That's a totally legitimate emotion to have when OCD is taking you over  especially if a medication has been promoted to you with false hope and you were really wishing for something that would take these awful thoughts away   However  the situation isn't truly hopeless  I'm coming to the end of my recovery now  moving into that symptom free zone for a lot of the time now  I just need it to be more consistent and get a bit more resilient to stress again   and my head feels unbelievably improved  I'm at a stage I never thought I would get to  I just don't have intrusive thoughts anymore  really  only the very normal infrequent ones maybe once a day where you get a tiny unscary moment of 'hey  imagine if I dived off this bridge' or 'just think  I could stab my cat with the kitchen knife right now ' and it goes away immediately after  Apart from the lingering phobia residue of my old OCD theme  I'm not getting any thoughts that actually severely scare me  or barge into my head and stay there  repeating  Plus there's been positive personality changes and other changes to thinking   I feel more confident  less socially nervous  I doubt my viewpoint on big issues less excessively  I feel more sure when I take decisions  all of which feels REALLY good   And a lot of people told me it wasn't possible to get to this stage  So I guess   being hopeless wasn't an accurate way to be  because improvement has been so major   A couple of things that might work for you to combat hopelessness  since you ask     Rate your recovery progress using measureable scales  and keep a quick record of them each day  Like  you can rate the amount of distress you're feeling at any given time out of 10  the number of times a day you give in and do a compulsion  the amount of intrusive thoughts you get in one morning etc  It's VERY motivating to look back through a recovery progress record and think 'wow  a fortnight ago I was going through the whole day at a 6  10 distress  and that felt pretty scary  but today's been my first real 3  10 day and it feels much more relaxed ' And if you have a shitty day where it's easy to forget all your progress  look back over the recovery records and realise that even though this afternoon has been a really mean 7  10  yesterday morning was only a 3   10  and you can aim for that again     Try an OCD recovery podcast  especially one you can just pick a motivational talk from and listen to first thing in the morning  OCD experts Ali Greymond's and Mark Freeman's ones might be best for you  because they firmly hold that OCD is a fixable problem you can make a good recovery from  because they have this personal experience and they help coach other people who also have this experiencea  Ali's one  https   www youtube com watch v xoZSqI6kioo and Mark's   https   www youtube com watch v BMqV746A7bs    Lots of great advice from them and sometimes it can be motivating on dark days just to hear them talk about recovering  even if it's a podcast you've heard before     Breaking your recovery down into 24 hours at a time can help too  If you can't even imagine how you're ever going to feel ok with these terrible thoughts  just stick to the day ahead of you and say 'Ok  whatever else happens  for this day  I'm going to try my hardest to do the healthy stuff I need to do  like cutting out compulsions  getting enough sleep  and taking my meds  and try my hardest not to unhealthy stuff that'll make my OCD worse  like giving in to compulsions or ruminating ' That way  you know that however bad today is  tomorrow is very likely to be a little better  because every single day you manage to do the right things instead of the wrong things is another day that your brain can heal  If its overwhelming to think of yourself having to resist compulsions all day every day for the rest of your life  it won't really be like that  but it feels that way when you're really suffering   don't try and think of those big time frames  Just put it more like 'Can I do the right things for the next 24 hours '           I was expecting  this  http   m imgur com HhFkkLo r   Thank you for this  I woke up this morning read this and now feel so much less anxious about my day   It's weird because I used to be strictly panic based  I would have frequent panic attacks   I almost kinda yearn for those days because at least it wasn't constant  I'd recommend telling all of this to the doctor who prescribed it to you   In fact  just cut and paste this into an email to the doctor  assuming you have their email address   You may just need a different dosage  or you may need a different med   What works for one person may do nothing for the next  it's not you it's just the way things are   And  it's probable that a med is only part of the solution for you   Don't give up  it's really worth finding what works for you  I already tried that  but the problem is that she keeps coming into my mind  because I am so used to it  Can't get her off my mind   Yeah    I just tried it with eating  literally just went into my kitchen and asked  'what will make me feel better'  And have since started eating some chickpeas  And I do already feel a little better  Seems intuition has something going for it  Thanks for this    sorry that you're dealing with it as well I think it's important for people with anxiety to find a job where they are surrounded by mostly kind and positive people   I have quite severe generalised anxiety disorder   I struggle to leave the house without panic attacks  new things are incredibly difficult for me and require lots of preparation and relaxation in advance  etc   and I graduated university in the first half of last year  thank god for being able to work from home   I was terribly scared that I wouldn't survive employment  But I mustered my courage up and just threw myself out there  and I will admit that I got very lucky    I ended up in a job where everybody I have contact with is pleasant  and the atmosphere is very relaxed  I've been here since July and I have had only a handful of very bad anxiety attacks   which for me  is extremely good  Jobs with fast changing environments  lots of travel  lots of customer facing time such as retail  probably aren't as good for anxiety as a "behind the scenes" job   I feel like you need to find work where you can rest assured that people are comfortable if you make mistakes every now and again  We can all try our best at our jobs and still make mistakes because we are only human  and it's important to note that being berated can be very damaging to someone with anxiety   It also probably helps to try and find work in something you are passionate about doing   for me it is computing and I am continually fascinated and immersed by what I do on a day to day basis  which is a great way for me to relax and take my mind off my anxiety  Not conspiracy like  It's a legitimate question   THC cannabis often causes bad anxiety  it can make you delusional but it can also definitely clear the way for real memories and things to appear to you  And that can be scary   I ate too much edibles last summer  and something similar to what you're talking about did happen  I did feel very anxious at points  uncomfortable  and got quick flashes of insight as to what happened to me  Revelations which are now just barely remembered because I was so high and because it's hard to retain high memories  They weren't memories per se  though  more just thoughts realizations about why I had a certain phobia  for instance  Putting pieces together and realizing the details of what might have happened to me   But I've never had concrete memories of what happened to me and so I'm still in the dark and going off of symptoms and feelings and random revelations but no hard "evidence "  Anyway  long story short  I think it can definitely help  but it's not for everyone  and the anxious state it often provokes is probably not going to make for a pleasant experience when you're already having a flashback to these kinds of memories  personally  meds were worth the time and effort it took to find the right combination   While it did take some trial and error in order to get to the right conclusion  I feel as if I am much better than previous   It is a guess and check sort of situation most of the time  so the best thing that you can do if you do start taking meds is be completely honest about any negative side effects and let the doctor weigh them against the positives    You sound alot like me  I went from 170 lbs to 120 lbs over the last 3 years just from anxiety and inability to eat  I've had emetophobia since I was 8  I'm 35 now   The thing that finally helped my emetophobia was anxiety meds and therapy  no joke  With me I have a fear that certain foods will trigger a reaction  making a reaction more likely to happen just due to the panic attack symptoms  So I avoid foods in general if they make me anxious  To make matters worse I have GERD and IBS which create symptoms and feed the emetophobia   The things that really helped me was finding the right meds for my anxiety  mainly the SSRIs  Cipralex  and  Benzos for anxiety panic  Clonazepam   I also take Domperidone for gut motility and Zofran for nausea  very expensive   Plus  the usual assortment of over the counter meds  Pepto bismol  Maalox  Zantac  Diovol  etc    I also eat lots of healthy priobiotics  sauerkraut  kefir  kombucha  and drink copious amounts of herbal tea  ginger  fennel  peppermint     Therapy is also very important  whether that's group therapy and or one on one counselling  I try to get as much as I can  I find it very helpful when dealing with my anxiey depression emetophobia  Just getting out of the house and having people to socialize with is very important  don't isolate yourself like I did for 10 years  until recently    I also do a lot of deep breathing  relaxation techniques  exercise yoga  distraction  etc   to try and reduce stress and anxiety  For me sleep is also very important  if I don't get a good sleep I'm sick the entire next day  So  I try to practice healthy sleeping habits  get off computer by 6 8pm  and then relax the remainder of night  keep a regular sleeping schedule  etc        tldr    From my experience the main thing is getting that anxiety in check  Once you manage the anxiety the emetophobia fear should come down with it  For me that means therapy  SSRIs  and benzos  Every person is different though  what worked for me might not work for you  There's a very strong anxiety emetophobia connection though in my opinion    I've never really understood why so many people think going to a movie theater is a group thing    You're sitting there in a dark room  not talking  ignoring the people around you  attention focused on he screen in front of you  Nothing about that seems like a social activity to me   I've been going to the movies alone for years  It's the only way to do it  if you ask me   Go during the day or early afternoon and the theater is usually empty  you get you pick of the seats and plenty of room on either side of you  My mom has decided to take him back  so yeah I'm nearly 20 and haven't dated anyone either   I also have no friends      I don't really know what to do  I can't put myself out there because I'm not really sure what that means  for one  and even if it literally means "just go outside" exactly what am I supposed to be doing out there  Hang out with my no friends   I don't know  apparently that's the end all of the situation "put yourself out there " thread over    Anyway  I'm lonely AF  if you want to talk about being a horrible failure  PM me  I can relate  I'v had it since February 2016  it's is honestly pure nightmare  But just remember it is not dangerous in anyway  But with anxiety it really feeds the loop  I sent you a PM with a link to a guide to help you through it   You definitely did the right thing   I've given up trying to find a solution to my generalised anxiety disorder long ago   but I never stop fighting to stay ahead of it  It feels so good for me to do something challenging that requires me to face my anxiety head on  aka almost everything  and win   Treatment or not  don't let it control you lovely people  It's all worth it in the end  Personally i feel medicine is good if you are really really out of it  but i find it very hard to work on the anxiety when i can't feel it    For me i started getting medicine for it  I was so fucked from anxiety that i was crippled mentally  after that  i had a good run with meds for some time  but i don't want to take meds the rest of my life so i weened off them but the anxiety came back 10fold   this is my experience and will not be the same for others  I had nothing  no tools to calm myself with or anything  i decided not to take any meds so i could learn to calm myself when i got a bad episode  I have GAD with some panic attacks  panic attacks i haven't had in a long while     When you are on meds and don't get help like a psyciatrist or something like that  you have nothing to withstand the anxiety when off them  Imho  The question here is    which one of us is the clone  I feel like there is no going back  I believe I will deal with this all my life  be it the symptoms  or like you say the darkness of it all  I'm not saying we are doomed but it'll always be a part of us  I think you develop a new perspective on thing  maybe a more cynical or distant one  to protect yourself    It doesn't mean life can't be enjoyed but you sure don't forget  The pain we experience d  clashes with our happy moments  The world is just    different  It can become an opportunity for growth and wisdom  I'm still debating if the pain was the cause of my growth as a good person   What device are you actually using  I've worn 3 different heart rate monitors at the gym one day while doing this free training class and they were all drastically different    Link to one on Amazon   https   www amazon com dp 1438008554 ref cm sw r cp apa lW6AybP350NNZ  For those too lazy to type in "adult connect the dots" into Amazon or Google themselves    I'm so sorry this happened to you  You have nothing to be ashamed of  It sounds like you were extremely intoxicated and he took advantage of you  He is the one who needs to feel sorry for his actions not you  No one has the right to force sex on someone who was clearly unconscious  You are allowed to feel however you want to  I don't think it's helpful if you try be "forget" this  You need to talk about how you feel and talk through it with someone you trust  these things are easier when shared   Whenever I smoke weed I get nervous  anxious and can't eat  I also think about all of the shortcomings I have caused and it generally makes me feel out of wit with myself   Sort of the same thing  I think chemically it's just not out thing  I can't do anything lol  Meanwhile all my friends excel while high   Let's quit together   I'm currently on medication for my Generalized Anxiety Disorder  I am so glad I finally sought medical help  I was lucky and the first one I was put on did the trick  I did experience a sensation of having drank 10 cups of coffee in an hour to begin with when I was easing myself into the medication and saw my Doctor again who suggested I continue with half doses a bit longer before going with the whole dose and that did the trick  I get these all the time  from grinding my teeth at night sometimes I catch my tongue or sides of my cheek and then I get a bump  Sometimes it's s little on the big size too like a dime even  Maybe smaller   Not sure exactly what you mean by thinner and thicker  I don't think I could tel that    And wisdom teeth suck  Especially if they are impacted or coming in weird  Could all be from that  Just ask your dentist at your next cleaning  They can do a swift X ray and confirm they messed up to all hell   That's so cool  I wish my FMIL was as thoughtful and kind   I have been where you are now and I can tell you one thing   it does get better  From your post I am getting that you feel like you don't really know who you are  This distressed me for many years and I have one big piece of advice for you  if that is how you feel   I never did find out those things that I was missing  and that you are missing  Instead  I accepted it as a part of my life that I would use as a "clean slate" to try and find new things to pursue  I feel like this might help you  Try new stuff  Search hard for those interests  You don't have to do a million things at once  But if you focus all your energy into doing something new  one thing at a time  you just might find yourself in a much better place   Where you are right now is only temporary  and you can't blame yourself for what others want for you  like your parents  It's okay for what  you  want and what your parents want to be very different   and if they don't understand or see that now  all you can do is hope that they do with time  You are not living your life for them  you are living it for you  never forget that   Around this time two years ago I felt like you feel now  Then I started just  doing stuff  Not quickly  I could only muster up so much courage because of my anxiety  but I would try new things when I felt positive enough to do so  After just a few months  I tried riding a motorcycle for the first time  It was one of the scariest experiences of my life  But it really clicked with me  I felt the same anxiety as I did doing everything else  but I felt something else too    The next two years that followed until now I have centred my entire life around that interest  I'm like an entirely different person  Finding something to do that you like can have a profound effect on you as a character  and there's always the bonus of meeting new people too  Being  excited  to go and do something  or to be a part of something  is a great motivator  And I wish I could help you find what your calling is  or find the motivation to chase it  but only you can help you with that   Ultimately  my advice is to use this time where you are feeling lost to develop yourself as a person  Instead of searching for pieces that you think should be there  have a shot at creating some new pieces  It could end up leading you on an amazing adventure  and I really hope it does  And even if you still don't know what you're going to do and feel stuck  focus on the excitement of finding out  Yes  My anxiety comes and goes  But it has been almost unmanageable the last two months ever since I accepted a new position in the company  I work in an large retail chain  I went from a position that kept me largely in the backroom to out front in the optical center  I took the job because it was more money and everyone told me how much they enjoy it  Long story short  it's a nightmare for me  The doctors I work in conjunction with frighten me to no end I'm constantly worried I'm going to screw something up and get fired  There are way too many times I am left alone in the department even though there are many tasks I haven't learned how to do yet  and once more  I'm terrified of messing something up  When patients come in to get their glasses adjusted I'm frightened of breaking them and my hands shake so bad that I have trouble doing the simplest of adjustments  Before work I have trouble eating anything because I gag  During work I am both hungry and want to throw up   It is so bad I have asked to return to my old position for less money  I feel like a colossal failure and disappointment but I have to do what is right by my health  I will most likely be seeing a counselor again when I return to my old job to work on my confidence issues and my poor management of stress  But after this  this is the last time I'm going to try to move up in the company  I would prefer to just be done with customer service all together and find a job elsewhere  Oh my goodness    thats terrible    I hope that it works out for you  hang in there  Before you ask  no  this isn't a shady way of saying "I"  But my friend has a relationship for literallybone day  Now he has hard time getting over it  Our ancestors developed mechanisms that are subconscious but were and are essential for our survival  That is why most people can depend on their feelings of fear  anxiety or what is called "impending doom"  they're there to keep us safe and warn us of possible danger after all  The problem with anxiety as a disorder is that our "system" is NOT working properly  it's oversensitive and therefore we cannot depend on it without questioning  If you're bleeding  hurt or there's anything wrong with your body or situation in general then yeah  you definitely want to take it seriously  otherwise it's just your brain being wrong again   That's great to see how assertive you are  even with anxiety under pressure  Just more of a reason to know that you're strong willed and kind      I used to have some really odd nightmares when I first started talking about the sexual assault I experienced  It's only recently that they have died down and I haven't had one for a long while  I've just finished specialist counselling and the link with the nightmares for me was control and power  My nightmares where usually unrelated to my abuser or the assault but the theme was very much linked  The counselling really helped as it helped get the stuff out of my head and express the anger and sense of loss I felt about the part of me that was gone   I also found getting a pillow with a small speaker in helped as I could play relaxation exercises or music through it  I also discovered the sleep with me podcasts  which are deliberately dull  meandering podcasts that give a focus to your thoughts without being stimulating  I got my pillow off amazon and I just plug my iPod into it and play stuff  I haven't needed to in a while but it's a good fallback if I find my dreams getting disturbed again  You can absolutely get through  I'm so proud of you for getting out and for starting therapy  It will take time but keep at it  Things will get better  Yeah  same for me   My parents had me in "therapy" but it was really just an attempt to get me to talk about what they wanted me to talk about   I don't think it actually benefitted me at all until I did it on my own and got to set the expectations  I have been on medications for 12 years or so  and I wouldn't be alive if it weren't for medications  I have ADHD  anxiety  OCD  and depression   If you find the right medication  it won't cause side effects like a mind fog    Good luck   Apple Watch gave me the 178bpm spike while walking  Polar H7 gave me the 17bpm while resting a few hours later  Wasn't using them at the same time   Yes  I'm so glad I'm never the only one   I started my job in September  This is my first full time position because I graduated college at the end of July  I felt so out of place because everyone in my office is so close knit  and we have to travel for weeks at a time with my job   plus  I am the youngest  I was out on the road just short of a month after starting  and honestly  little training  I really only started and am in transitioning to "being more comfortable"  my anxiety literally keeps me on edge 24 7   and truly learning all the information after traveling and talking to people  I'm really not happy with where I am at  and I'm only here because I receive full tuition remission if I go back for my Master's  which I am planning on doing and feeling rushed to start   If you're allowed to get up and walk around or take a small break outside  that helps me since I'm at a desk all day  staring at the computer  Give yourself the 5 minutes you need to recollect your thoughts and breathe  you more than deserve it     I didn't feel anxious that night  but the difference was that that was he most of ever eaten   that  is what makes me question the Ligitimacy  Maybe you could thank  and possibly apologize to  your friends for helping you out at the time it was happening  I'm sure they will respond with something like "hey  that's what friends are for " because for non emets  it is no big deal  I understand how you are feeling embarrassed about the situation  so I think that by apologizing  and or thanking your friends for being there to help you out  it might make you feel better  Me too  I got one of these for Christmas as well  They're really therapeutic for me and help reduce my anxiety  Not sure why  but it helps   That's a bummer  It's hard not to get attached  I went to therapy  I'm on Paxil  25mg every night at bedtime  and just trying to focus more on myself rather than others  Yes  I still have my bad days  but I still work hard to make sure I don't let it get the best of me   I mean if it makes you feel better  There are a few class action lawsuits against a few of the big brands  Fitbit is the biggest I think with one going  It could be settled by now  But it seems as tho the ones on your wrist are pretty inaccurate  Especially when you are doing something   And they aren't doctor "making any medical decisions      Thank you for this reminder and congratulations   It's so important to remember to take it day by day  and not to be too hard on ourselves  All progress is good progress     That is absolutely legitimate  He took advantage of the fact that you were a young kid  who was not neurotypical  He took advantage of your kindness to sexually abuse you  It doesn't have to haunt you every day to be real  You don't have to be a perfect saint for it to be real  In your mind as a kid  it sounds like you picked up on a sense from the grownups that coercion alone wouldn't be taken as seriously as it  really was   and you wanted to make sure that they understood that what happened was wrong  It's sad that even after going through sexual assault  we often have to worry about people not believing us    And you did what you had to in order to make sure they'd listen  with the tools you had as a kid    Any consequences that came down on him  or harm that came to his family  are because of  his  actions  He committed a very serious crime  All you did was tell the appropriate authorities about it  That's on him  not you    Your experience is legitimate  And you shouldn't have to feel guilty about it  You did your best  and  you  didn't hurt anyone   This is the same way my and my girlfriend are  Thanks    though the  17bpm blip was a Polar chest strap and I wasn't moving  just sitting there  I hadn't wet the electrodes in a while as they ask you to do     but all the other readings near that moment seemed accurate   Sounds like you are dealing with a lot   is the person who gave you the diagnosis someone you can get counselling from    Are you still in school   Make sure you see if your school has a disability services department because you might be able to get some extra time to do your assignments   The 2 strategies that I used when I felt really bad is Cognitive Behaviour Therapy and forcing myself to try to do occasional volunteer work without too much pressure   Maybe there is something you can do a couple of hours a week    It will help you see what your other interests are and get you connected with your local community    You did a really good thing  I hope you're okay  I am glad that stuff like this is getting more acceptable to buy and do  I used to work in a daycare and it would give me huge anxiety  On days where it was particular bad I would crank out there or coloring books and it would give the kids something to do and would get me calm too  Michaels sometimes has those too btw   chgorocks2  You've posted really negatively a few times here  so others please keep that in mind  Dont take it to heart too much  You cant say "Normal folks in relationships with ocd partner RUN as FAST as you can " it totally depends on the situation  what the OCD partner is doing to fix it  and I guess the type of OCD  Dont fuel the OCD thats for sure  dont help with rituals etc  ERP  Exposure Response Prevention  is a great proven tool  but treatment aside  your comments chgorocks2 are to your personal experience  dont make people lose hope for no reason  OCD can be treated to 'virtually cured' and people can live life again  Relationships dont have to end  but if they do  its down to the couple to know based on the situation  Some random person on the internet has no say in that  I had the same issue at 22 and went thru a ton of test  Ended up I didn't have an ulcer and it was just from stress causing issues to my stomach  Turns out increase production in stomach acid is one of the first things your body does under stress    Have you had a scope done to your upper gi  It would tell you if you had stomach cancer or even an ulcer  Also a gi doctor talk would help if you have been having issues  More then a regular doctor    You literally sound like 22 year old me  I was in my last semester of college when it all started  Probably from all the stress going into the real world was bringing   I had to keep a food journal of what caused my biggest problems stomach wise  and just cut them out of my diet  I still eat fairly crappy  But I always make sure to do something probiotic and get in enough healthy stuff to balance it out  Once I started eating better and eating yogurt daily  I haven't had any chronic shits  but I do occasionally get stomach discomfort  I'm used to it by now  It's nothing serious  Usually just a build up of gas that I panic over and make worse   It helps me to deconstruct them  and identify what the underlying fear is    For instance  I have dreams that sound pretty mild and normal  but I feel very upset over  In the most recent one  I had a guest in my home for the first time and he criticized my decor  It might sound silly  but I woke up  unreasonably  upset  So I dug into that feeling until I identified that the main "button" getting pushed was shame  So from there  I could reassure myself not about the dream  but about what's really on my mind    I've given up on trying to control dreams  But you can control how you respond  You live a good life  and you're a responsible pet owner  and your little ones are okay  And you'll be okay too   Exact same experience with Ativan  I would randomly fall into fits of anger and scream at my wife over little things    It was a tough time  Yes  sadly everything is actually a symptom of everything  Because by this point there is enough cases that enough people have claimed they have had every symptom wth every single disease  All it takes is one google search to mentally crippled someone     My PTSD nightmares seem to come and go in waves  I have noticed they're much less common and less severe when I sleep a little bit cold  no heating blanket  maybe one less blanket on me then I'd like  and when I don't eat anything for 3 5 hours before bed  I also like to sip herbal tea before bed  the ingredients don't do anything but I find it calming  I also have a very non stressful tv show or podcast ready on my phone to watch if I wake up from a nightmare  since it quickly diverts my attention away from the nightmare and back to reality  Hey  I understand why you feel like blaming yourself   Sometimes it can even feel a little easier to take responsibility for someone else's bad actions  because it means we could have controlled the outcome    However   this was not your fault   You did nothing wrong   The consequence of drinking too much is a hangover and a dry mouth  not sexual assault   This person is a predator   He fed you alcohol and he himself wasn't drunk  or not enough to impair his ability to take video and force you to do sexual acts   He is fully at fault here  not you   If you can talk to someone who is kind and understanding about this  it might be helpful   It's a lot to carry with you  this kind of experience   You shouldn't have to struggle with it alone  As a teenager I had panic attacks  Eventually I found myself on Paxil and later Zoloft which essentially fixed it  The panic attacks became rare and predictable  In college I went off all meds  I am now 29 and they have manifested in a new way  I get extremely anxious anywhere that I cant get to a bathroom or perceive it as inappropriate to suddenly leave and go  For example a 10 minute meeting at work is hell to me as soon as I realize I am trapped in that room  My stomach will turn and a panic will set in  Car rides are a nightmare  I am 29 and this started slowly this summer but has escalated now and has begun to take over my life  Christmas parties were hardly enjoyable  I went as far as to get a colonoscopy and am on some stomach meds now but it has become apparent that the mental end is the bigger problem since the gastro didnt find any wrong  I never wanted to go back on anxiety meds but I just scheduled an appointment with the doctor  I will probably look into CBT this time around as well  Heres to hoping this roller coaster if over soon  I know you have already tried many things  and therapy  But here are my 2 cents  Try this book  Overcoming OCD by David Veale  Its fantastic  It is the core book used by therapists who are leaders in the field  So if you cant afford the fancy OCD programs  try this book  They literally use it in their own treatment programs   https   www amazon ca Overcoming Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Behavioral dp 046501108X ref sr 1 1 ie UTF8 qid 1483455743 sr 8 1 keywords Overcoming Obsessive Compulsive Disorder  Different methods work for different people  but I find a good combo is using SSRI meds to bring the anxiety OCD down to manageable levels and then using CBT such as Exposure Response Prevention to then treat the OCD  and then keep going and slowly reduce the medication  to the point where you no longer need the meds  and the CBT is what is keeping the OCD at bay  Using this approach I have seen OCD virtually disappear but you need to keep a wary eye to the signs and symptoms and fight it quickly if it ever creeps back  Hey  what you're feeling is totally understandable   You have every right to be angry with this person   He was a predator  a criminal and an abuser     It's a human reaction to feel pity for someone who dies   But that doesn't erase their other behavior   This man was a complex person  so it's possible to feel bad for his death  but absolutely hate his behavior prior to death     I think it would be a lot to expect you to just deal with this type of situation alone   It's complicated and difficult   Do you have any kind of support network  where you can talk to someone about how you feel  This is actually super helpful  For whatever reason that last line really reassured me  Thank you very much  They told you those things to try to silence you and excuse their behavior   They know what they did was evil     You did NOTHING wrong   They went after you and hurt you  they are criminals and they deserve to be locked up   Is there anyone you can talk to about this who could help you to get some care   You might need to go to the doctor  So yesterday I felt a little gross still in my tummy  but was able to self soothe  I felt afraid to eat because I was afraid of the aftermath  That alone keyed me in that I was afraid of my IBS  and that I know that  and it's ok  Today I'm still a little yucky  Granted I still have a stuffy nose and cough  Sometimes the longer something persists  the more worn I feel against it  This phobia is so mean   Dude  everything in this comment    Part of the problem with Trump  and part of the problem I have in even trying to understand the most basic elements of what the next 4 years are going to look like  is that I have no idea what he really believes  because his stated policies change from moment to moment  "Build that wall" becomes  "well  a fence" becomes "well  a wall    in some places " A week before the third debate  he had  no  position on abortion  then the night of  suddenly he's mister ain't life of the unborn the best  It's like pure chemical flip flopping injected right into the eyeball    But as a consequence  I feel like it's safer to take him at his word on everything  even when that everything conflicts with itself  However  I recently read an article about a family in a rural area near where I live who are scared about losing their healthcare despite having voted for Trump because  "We assumed he didn't mean it " WHAT THE EVER LOVING FUCK     The husband is on dialysis and a waitlist for a liver transplant  and you thought this was a good time to roll the dice on whether or not the "Obama care is a disaster" guy means it  I know you're stupid out of desperation  but jesus christ are you stupid  yes  I've had way too many to count  How do you mean confirmed    And yeah  a lot of people in my friend's list are black and Latinx  and I'm pretty worried for them after Jan 20    What are your thoughts on all the think pieces saying that left leaning people need to layoff the identity and racial politics  The last time I was s  I was drunk  And I was also very calm because I had no idea it was happening  To this day  it's the only time that I feel ease around because 1  My body literally saved me  It was also one and done and I felt worlds better after  2  You can absolutely control this so it doesn't happen in the future  Water  water  water  eat  know your limits  I understand the obsession  But this is one time you absolutely NEEDED to get it out   Just want to chime in to add another voice to the conversation   I'm going through something similar and slowly learning to trust that my doctor knows best  And there are a lot more who know how you feel  Hang in there  and like lostinedental said  just breathe   I can feel the same sometimes  Im 22 and ive never had sex nor have I ever kissed a girl  I went on one date before and its the only thing on my love life's resume    But the key is to not dwell on your lack of experience because the truth is at this age every single girl is going to be way more experienced than you so its not even worth worrying about  If you dwell on it you are completely screwed     I've been told Hillary actually won the popular vote too  a la Gore   Yeah  by something like 3 million votes  On one hand it's comforting  of the people who voted  they slightly prefer her to him  which seems slightly more rational  On the other hand  it's depressing because the Republicans have spent the last 8 years rigging the fucking game behind the scenes so that the voting districts would land in their favor  and it paid off "bigly "   I was barely around for Reagan  My first conscious memories of a president are Bush sr  But Reagan's administration was pretty fucked up  and yet you can't get near the presidency without singing a hymn to the great and powerful RWR  Even Hillary had to say how fantastic he was when almost everything awful about our current situation can be traced back to policies he enacted    I was going to vote for Bernie in the primary  I lived in CO at the time  which he won  so ultimately it didn't really matter   but discovered at the last moment that I didn't change my party affiliation from Republican from waaaaay back when I first got my license  I voted for Bush in 2004 as my first election  At the time  as a dumbshit 20 year old   I thought I had the world figured out and it seemed so obvious and easy  I feel like getting people to see their own ignorance is sort of the key to getting them to vote smarter  Like  an honest admission of knowing that we don't know a lot would go so much farther than being very confident in the small bit we do know  But I think conservativism creates a double bind in that regard  many of their values don't stem from knowledge itself  In fact  the act of conservation is  in many ways  a push against new knowledge because you're trying to preserve an old way of being  and old ways of being often fly in the face of new knowledge  But then they start to revere simpler modes of being expressly because they're simpler and not because they're factually better   Hey there   I'm sorry you're going through this   Are you still in a control situation with your parents   I ask because I was severely abused by controlling parents  and I could not heal very well until I was away from them   For me it took a huge student loan and three part time jobs  but it was worth it to get out from their home and their toxic behavior   It was incredibly difficult for me to even think straight when every time I walked in the door I was barraged with abusive comments   If you are out from your parents home  then I think you might start by putting less pressure on yourself   It sounds like you're pushing yourself to figure out who you're attracted to and to move on those feelings  but if you feel confused  then acting on attraction may just be hurtful to you     It is okay to feel angry and hateful sometimes   During my severe depression times I would feel like I just wanted to destroy my body completely  Sometimes I felt suicidal and sometimes I just felt this global anger at my entire being   A lot of that was anger at other people  at my abusers  that I was redirecting inward   The important thing is  don't judge yourself for those feelings   They're only emotions  they aren't "wrong" or "bad"   it's just a way to feel   If you are able  feel them and let them pass     And if you can  be kind to yourself   Start with small self care  and build up from that   If you can do small things   go to bed on time  take your medications  if you have them  as I do  at the same time each day and be proud of yourself for that  wear comfortable clothing that you actually like  do some meditation if you are able   Once you get a good habit track going  you can fall back on it during really bad times   I'd be happy to talk more about this with you but I don't want to overwhelm you right off the bat  No it might not get worse  if it does or does not  you or me wont know  only those in the relationship  seriously what are you trying to achieve  You can give advice  but you should not say things like this with 100  certainty  You dont know the situation  And OCD does not have to take control  It just takes the right approach  I'm sorry if you had a bad experience or heard about a bad one  but it doesnt have to be bad for everyone  I would however say that regarding the post about the person getting help putting clothes on etc  the person without the OCD should try not to join in doing rituals compulsions avoidances This in the long run could make it worse  Help them fight it another way  But actually  we should not really tell people what to do here  https   www reddit com r ROCD comments 5cwxmz stop posting personal advice   Read that link  I know its not for this sub reddit  but the notes are still important  So far  yeah  I've been with them 3 weeks  and the average seems to be a little over  10 an hour   Probably nothing compared to yours  but I also live in an area that doesn't see a lot of tourism  Pretty cool  I have a couple good coloring books myself  I'm glad people are rediscovering simple pleasures like this  No praabs    And in many instances  it's not necessarily Trump and his policies I fear  though they aren't exactly a prize either   but the fact that the KKK and various white supremacy organizations love him so much  His presidency gives them a degree of validation they haven't had in a long time  and that's what the documented outbreak of violence testifies to  the super duper racists feel like it's their time to shine  All the planned protests on the 20th are going to get fucking bonkers   This isn't to say all Trump supporters are crazy racists  I think at the most 20  are  but that 20  is pretty spooky  This guy  for example  http   www cnn com videos us 2016 12 07 richard spencer texas am ganim dnt ctn cnn There's a longer piece about him from The Atlantic that's worth reading too  What more can you ask for  That's great progress  Would appreciate it if you could put some context to this  what do they usually expect from you  Also Is it your perception of how all people treat you or is it certain individuals and their particular personality traits that make you feel uncomfortable  I just got one of these yesterday and I totally agree   First of all  congratulations on not 'freaking out' about your new diagnosis  I'm really proud of you too  That can be very scary on its own  and with anxiety it can be even worse    As far as being scared to sleep  I'm so sorry for what you're going through  We all know how important sleep is  and if you're anything like me your anxiety probably gets worse if you're not well rested  My biological father has sleep apnea  and while he doesn't suffer from high anxiety  it made him deeply afraid to sleep as well  The good thing is that they had solutions for him  he now sleeps with a mask that helps him breath during the night  even if his brain forgets  This actually has helped with his depression and with a heart condition he takes medication for    I'd encourage you to pursue a sleep study and talking to your doctor about possible solutions  I seems so much easier to not know and not deal with situations on this side of them    but imagine what it will feel like to have control over this situation and be working toward some solutions to help you be healthier  It's okay to be scared and feel like you're up against something scary and unknown  but you have me and r anxiety to help you along the way    Good luck with whatever you decide moving forward  and please PM me if you want to talk or need some extra support   Yeah  I feel awful Totally true  When I'm really keyed up  I feel paranoid  It helps to stop and think "OK  is there some specific reason I think something is going on  Probably not " I am going through the exact same thing right now  except that I have to go to work tomorrow  I don't want to postpone it again  I feel like the more time passes the more afraid I become  I am not sure I can stay there for 8 hours and focus on my job  Last time I was there I started crying and wanted to go home  I don't know what to do    I'm so sorry this happened to you  Have you thought about getting tested for STD's  I would consider talking to somone about this and if you are comfortable maybe talking the police  It is obviously up to you and you have to do what you feel comfortable with  whatever decision you make it will be the right one  Maybe contacting someone from your local rape crisis is also a good idea  they will be able to point you in the right direction  I am always here if you want to talk  my parents are quite controlling  asking where I am  where I got my pills from  psychiatrist   to gender identity issues  very controlling and repressive   I just feel completely messed up like I'm just externally alive to keep them happy  but inside I've been ripped apart completely and very hallow inside  I don't know how to proceed with relationships either  it's like if someone talks to me  female  I want to get real close with them and start a "relationship" but have no idea how they'd react if they later discover inside I feel different and all the mess I've been through   I'm going through  I feel so  so much pain in my upper inner thighs and groin  I have a lot of avoidance strategies  I try and get busy when I have intrusive thoughts  Go for a walk  clean my house  drink tea  moisturise  paint my nails  go online and read the news blogs  exercise if I can be bothered to  plan meals to cook  generally avoid letting my mind idle too much  I avoid showers during these times which probably isn't great    Or you can try to 'put it down'  By which I mean give physical form to whatever is going through your head and then you can put it down and walk away from it  I do this by writing in a journal  but especially writing poetry and painting is helpful for me  I was able to put down and walk away from a lot of distressing memories because of painting  I keep the paintings and can choose to look at them or not  But having them out of me is a relief    If your problem is persistent  I'd say you should seek professional support if you haven't already  Counselling may help  Best thing I did for myself is get back on anti depressants and anti anxiety medication     Wish you all the best   It's been a little over seven years  and the PTSD isn't as bad as it used to be  The depression and anxiety are manageable with medication and monthly therapy  Working out releases some good mood boosting hormones  I did yoga for a while  I journal sometimes  I play video games with online friends and that's a big part of my social life and makes me happy  And I acknowledge that it may never get 100  better  and that this may always be a burden I have to bear  Everyone has burdens  despite what their bright and peppy social media feeds may tell you  This one is mine  and I can be strong enough to carry it  as long as I do what is necessary  such as take my little white pill every morning  Things may not ever be the same as they used to  but I do believe they get better   Everyone has told me to make something beautiful from my pain   Yes  my happiness is forever dulled  I agree with the other poster that there is no going back  But i also have learned to embrace the darkness  to use it as fuel to succeed at work and school  to create beautiful  tormented art    So much of my life is fucked because of my trauma  I have c ptsd because I've had multiple traumas  I have embarrassed myself over and over with my extreme insecurities and obsessive clingyness to those I deem worthy to trust  I have so many issues  my weight constantly goes up and down  switching between not eating and eating too much  I've had an eating disorder for a long time     My traumas have created so much pain in my life  I often feel like screaming and crying  wailing  Yet I walk around  numb to most of life  I'm so far away from fixing how they continue to effect me  But I have learned how to take that pain inside of me  and turn it into something good  Even talking to others  sharing your experience and stories  sharing your strength   is a way to fight the dulling    It doesn't bring you back to who you used to be  but it does counter the effects with something different and good   something that is you  something that makes you feel better about yourself  something you can always carry with you   Can you go "LC"  limited communication  with your parents   If you are 18  they don't have ANY right to pry into your life   And they will continue to terrorize you as long as they are able to do that  Thank you so much  This looks awesome  I'm pretty into the adult coloring books right now  so this would be a nice addition  There's something to be said for completing a project  no matter how simple  and being able to feel good about it   It's difficult  culturally  legally they can't pry into my life  but culturally they could pry into my life even if it was under physician patient privilege  I live overseas  don't really want to disclose location just in case my mother follows me here  I'm experiencing something similar   My partner is amazing and affirmative and understanding and compassionate beyond belief  I could go on about how good he is for me  But I still worry about all of those "what if"s  What if he doesn't really love me  What if I'm not good enough for him  What if he actually secretly hates me  Am I too clingy  Too distant  Did I say the wrong thing    When I end up in these negative thought spirals  I feel like my anxiety will devour me alive   How can anyone live like this   My therapist told me that when I end up in these spirals of self doubt convinced that he's going to leave me etc to just repeat "I'm worthy of love" over and over again for like a minute  and maybe take a Lorazapam  lol   Exactly    been trying so hard to not Google my symptoms and to not look up illnesses  but sometimes I crack thinking I could handle it when I can't  I guess I have to keep trying   I'm 23 and the same  Damn  seems like currently I'm the oldest relater to OP here  p Omg yes   It's pretty much all I think about at all times and the reason I'm so suicidal   Glad I'm not alone hello  i've had anxiety since i was a teenager  but i was just put on lexapro and xanax a couple years ago  i'm a law student  so i'm in a really high stress environment a lot of the time  but i'm learning to deal with my anxiety through medication and self care   The past six months i've had quite the crippling anxiety   panic attacks  I wish someone would have been thoughtful enough to try to give me some coping mechanisms such as this  as a gift  But I am thankful of course for getting any presents at all  Good to hear that someone is going through the same thing as me  I just felt ok the past couple weeks and thought that I could go in  Are there any options for you like a modified schedule or working from home  I'm hoping to make it in at some point today  but me and my HR director talked about that in the event I wasn't able to start back up soon  My anxiety typically passes by mid morning so hopefully I can make it in around 11   The series is called Connect Your Way to Calm   I have this one  https   www amazon com Dot Dot Cats Connect Your dp 031635841X   There is absolutely hope for you   I have ptsd from sexual trauma and other abuse as a kid and a rape in my early twenties   I'm 27 now and feel like I'm living for the first time   I still have minor symptoms like nightmares or occasional triggers but overall I am more trusting of the world and people and live mostly "in the moment "  It takes a long time but definitely give therapy your all   That helped me so much   And journaling about the traumas   Also check out some books on trauma   Idk how well your English reading ability is but I loved cptsd by pete walker and the courage to heal  guide for survivors of childhood sexual abuse by Ellen bass and Laura Davis   Those are absolute gems   Maybe they'd have them translated in your native language   Definitely try those out   Lots of self care is important   Treat yourself with the love and respect and care you deserve  I carry a lot of my stress in my head and I get headaches often myself  The headaches send me into panic attacks sometimes because I'm sure I'm having a stroke if they come on suddenly so I understand what you're going through  It sucks that it's so hard convincing yourself you're okay    at least now you know you're not alone    I'm not sure where she got  mine  https   www amazon com Dot Dot Cats Connect Your dp 031635841X  but I saw some at Michael's craft hobby store  The job makes you suicidal   That blows  Yes  I agree  I've been going to movies alone for years too  since times that I was still in middle school  On some occasions I went with classmates  as I didn't have any friends outside school  or parents  but since I actually have been enjoying movies and the cinema experience more than people who surround me  there was no other option than to go alone  It kinda started bothering me at some point  ages 16   19  but never even once after that  Being the last one to leave the hall  Say "have a nice evening" to the staff  in the past used to be embarrased   Now in fact to me watching alone is also the best way to enjoy a movie  I get to concentrate on the movie  plot  music  cinematography  acting  lighting  visual effects    and after that I can remain in thoughts about the movie and so on   But not all is set to stone  there have been people with whom watching a movie in cinema has actually been also a fun experience  Mostly  however  I try to invite someone only when the movie I plan to see is something that i'm not sure about  either due to critics or trailer  I try to cry whenever possible  I also ude EMDR an eye movement tool that helps to balance the left and right brain  and filter stress in the memory center  I'm 25  so not really  Assuming you live in the UK  because of A Levels etc   go to your GP and ask about seeing an occupational therapist   this has been the most helpful for me  CBT has helped but Occupational Therapy works by finding ways to do the things you want to do  They can meet you at your home and help you to go out  sort you out with an exposure therapy type treatment tailored for you  help with general life stuff like sleep schedules and mine has even sorted out going to art classes  I live in Scotland and I've also had help from "Befriending Services" which despite the patronising name is simply someone who comes to you and simply takes you out to help with any exposure work that you might need someone to accompany you  which sounds like it might help you since your family is unwilling to help  the one I used was called SAMH but unfortunately they are a Scotland only service       With all due respect to some of the other posters in the thread  going back to school or to a gym will almost definitely not be an easy "small" step for you  You aren't pathetic for not being able to go out without someone else  I've certainly been in that position and I know many of the other posters on r agoraphobia have been or are exactly where you are  some people call this being housebound  A good way to judge a small step to get better from agoraphobia is to choose something you think you can do  but that will raise your anxiety levels a bit  For me 3 years ago and in a very similar position to you this was simply sitting at the window looking out for 10 minutes  I repeated this until my anxiety reaction was much lower then increased the difficulty  longer period of exposure  then opening the window  standing by the door and so on  eventually each of these steps took me a few months later to being able to go to the shops alone  I'm still in the middle of recovery so there is an awful lot I can't do  but everything I have been able to do has been the result of tiny seemingly insignificant steps  I do this if it's over a prolonged period too  I'm happy to have people chat about whatever and just input when I can if they're really interested in what they're talking about  But if it goes on for too long I lose my socialisation motivation  if that makes sense  and I'll be pretty quiet for the rest of the night   I find people chatting about stuff in a small group I have no idea about increases my anxiety because I don't want to look dumb  nave or uninteresting and that causes me to spend a lot more energy even though I'm saying nothing which wears me out quicker    I don't really have a solution for you sorry but you're not alone  Is she receiving professional help  therapy  meds      You sound like a very kind and supportive partner  but this is beyond you   It doesn't sound like you guilt her or pressure her so I don't see more you can do besides encourage her to get help    I feel the same way  I lived in abusive households growing up  It haunts you in ways you don't expect  like a trigger for me is slamming doors  even sometimes just closing a door loudly will make me jump through the roof and send me into an anxiety attack  Honestly I just force myself   I don't work but I am in school full time and have a family  three children    I try to rarely let my anxiety keep me at home or stop me from doing what I need to do  it does happen occasionally      The whole thing is to not overthink it  just get in the car and go   When you start to worry you won't make it  envision a stop sign and say the word STOP to yourself   Every single time a worry creeps up   Crank up the music and sing at the top of your lungs   Just get there   You can do this  What kind of job will you be doing  Project programming  tool programming  IT  bugfix  databases management        Depending on what your tasks are  your involvement with other people vary   I'm a software engineering student currently doing and internship in a big name company  I'm mostly doi g programming on the main project to further that peoject  and I also work a lot with another department of peogrammers specialized in datamining on the user's interacrions with our project  I implement stuff that sends data to their databases  I also do bugfixing like every other programmer in my department   My point is  I was scared shitless to do interviews  and when I entered the company for my first 2 weeks  I had no prior programming job experience  so this was pretty much like stepping on the unknown  And I adapted  It is scary at first  because you don't know anybody  you don't know what you're doing  you don't know if you're doing your job properly or if you are closing tasks fast enough  I know that for the first 2 months  I was scared that I wasn't doing a good enough job   My main contact throughout the first month was my internship supervisor  who was the lead for my team of programmers  I would report to him  I would get my tasks from him  and I would go to him for help  He introduced me to other people from various departments sometimes because they had the info I needed  He helped me fit in  He helped me know who to go to when I needed help from a specific department   After a month  I was pretty much ok with asking other people directly for help  I even started talking a lot more to the collegues that were sitting on the desks around me   After two months  I had and internship meeting with my school evaluator and my supervisor  And I learn that I was doing a great job  and that I adapted to and learned the project better than most interns they had in the past  However  he said that I was reluctant to go directly to other people for help and that I needed to broaden my circle of contacts   So overall  I wasn't doing so bad at all  I'm saying all this because I was in your shoes  Scared of interactions  scared of judgement from co workers  And overall  I discovered that its not that bad  Its harder at first simply because you don't know anyone and you have to learn the project  and you feel like you don't know what your doing or that you're not doing it good enough   Truth is  you're an intern  You're not expected to know everything  You're not expected to adapt as fast as someone who has been in the industry for years   As for relationship  everything will come in time  If you're scared of talking to other people and need help with your tasks  go to your supervisor or your lead  Talk to him  He'll guide you to whom you need to talk to  He's there to help you  He'll introduce you to the right people   Good luck  I hope you enjoy yourself  Have you had counselling    Are you seeing a therapist  Are you able to see one  It seems like you're in a vicious cycle with these things  and the best thing to do might be to address the anxiety  If only we could consciously control our internal organs  eh  I go to an art class once a week and have been going for just over a year and it has only become easier getting there in the past couple of months  and still occasionally it will be difficult  The only suggestions I have would be doing some more exposure work on days off  it doesn't have to be tasks as difficult as your trip to work  anything that raises your anxiety level will teach your body how to dissipate anxiety  and using more coping tools to help you feel less anxiety while out  grounding  breathing exercises  distraction techniques     There are things that freak me out  too  people walking into my room when i'm sleeping cause me to panic and freeze   i'm having relationship issues trying to be a normal girl with a boy and have to kind of play a game in my head where i pretend to be normal and ask myself 'how would a normal girl act '  once in a while i get this sense of terror when i walk into a house  like just walking in from the outside triggers me and i start to panic   and cold  i hate the cold  he locked me outside until i was so cold and hungry that i begged to come in  fucking winter   i stay places that are warm and have people  lots of times i just sit quietly in my cafe and just let the feeling of people being there make me feel comfortable  i write about it just to help get it out of my head   in my journal   my therapist asked if i wanted meds but i said no   Yeah  no need for that   I do think that limiting your parents contact with you might be a good first step   Have you checkout out r raisedbynarcissists   They have some solid strategies and support for people like us   I have found the "grey rocking" technique particularly useful  Yes  Even when no one is watching sometimes I wonder if I'm walking properly when in public  so I start being overly conscious of my legs and then I start walking weird  Sometimes my arms stop moving along with my legs when I do that  or I'll walk with steps that vary in length  or I'll use one leg more than the other one  one moves further than the other repeatedly   or I'll walk but my momement slowly shifts towards one side  so its like I'm turning  and I try to shift the other way to center myself on my path it looks like I'm incapable to walk in a straight line     Nothing is wrong with you  Overthinking is part of our nature  There is probably a way to make it manageable  And Moolk  Why don't we call milk moolk  So much better  Adult connect the dots  Does it make sexy images after you're done connecting all the dots  Thank you  It's definitely a relief to know I'm not alone   Quit your job   It might be looked down upon  but you need to worry about your own health first   You are not mentally strong enough to handle that kind of work yet   Go to therapy  or at least try tackling your anxiety by starting small and working your way up to more stressful activities   I don't mean to offend you or make any assumptions  but if your anxiety is consistently acting up at your job  you're probably not doing the company you work for any favors either   The time you spend coping with your anxiety compromises your ability to perform the tasks expected of you  and if it happens too frequently  it becomes a liability   In my opinion  it is okay to quit a job that is too stressful as long as you either look for a job that is less stressful  or you actively work on your stress anxiety tolerance so you can eventually handle the same job or similarly stressful work in the future  17 beats per min would be the word record by 10 beats tho  I'd chock that one up to bad recording   You're not alone here  I'm currently on the same boat  It's hard  but believe in yourself and surround yourself with people that care about you   I'm not and I'm not actually able to see one at the moment  It really is so frustrating because I'm irritating those lymph nodes and on top of that  my wisdom teeth are comming all at once pushing all my teeth so I really feel awful   But I'll really need to visit someone when I'm done with exams because I feel trapped in my own head  I just wish I could do more  So here is the google search of pugs https   www google ca search q pug pictures num 40 source lnms tbm

help so thank you  Yeah  I know I can't handle it  So I've been trying not to try  But it's impossible  I mean someone can read right on your face you aren't feeling good  Anxiety or not  then spurt out at you "it's def cancer" at any time of your day  I'm a mathematician and a man of stadtics  That's what drives me the most insane  I understand the odds of me getting x is under 1   But I understand someone's gotta be that 1     Even tho I'm fairly healthy  I just have horrible posture and a neck muscles that's Torn or tare or cut or whatever the doctor thinks it is  Thanks    well it only gave me that 17bpm reading for 12 seconds  meaning that theoretically my heart could have paused for a few seconds  causing the average for that brief period to go from 65bpm to 17bpm  That would be scary  Hopefully it was just a bad recording   Yes to meds  and she has received a lot of therapy over the past few years but isn't currently talking to a professional about this and I don't think has ever discussed this particular issue with anyone before  I'm going to try and broach the topic of talking to a therapist about help for this but I know she's unwilling to go back into therapy  this is the first time in several years she hasn't regularly been going to therapy or counselling  I think she doesn't want to take a 'step back' so to speak   It might be hard to find someone who works with bodily anxieties  It might be worth trying to find them now and asking them to write your teachers about your anxiety  my therapist did that for me and I  benefitted a lot from that  put me in a mindset to deal with or avoid  mostly avoid  my  school  anxieties  I got there with an "empty tank" at around 11 am  My mom and I saw one of these at the store before Christmas and picked it up  It's awesome to leave on the table  because everyone always finds a few minutes in their day to do one  then my step mom colors them in  It is definitely relaxing  much less stressful than doing sudoku puzzles  I got one in the check out line at Safeway  with all the magazines  Most grocery stores have little puzzle books and such up there  My god perfecting the way that I walk has been a battle since the early years of high school  I could always walk normally in a crowd but when I was in situation where there were people behind me but not many in front I would walk like a complete idiot  I would be completely stiff and for somebody that is right handed it was bizarre that my right leg was always out of rhythm with my left  My step length was never consistent  or my speed  or my level of bounciness  Nor could I even keep a straight path but I would slowly walk diagonally    Its taken such a long time but I am finally able to walk like a normal person in public  The biggest thing was realizing that I never notice how other people walk so why would they notice the way that im walking    design engineer for a company that produces commercial vehicles   Oh Jesus  That's incredible  I did 11 days of travel and in North America and I had hit my limit  Congrats on your bravery   You did supergood  Better to be safe than sorry  Great job  Try to see ocd as a thought process rather than focusing on particular elements of it  For instance it's really helped me to break it down into   Obsession  intrusion a feeling etc  Compulsion  behaviour can be physical or mental to bring down anxiety    Then you can apply it to so many different things and they don't seem as scary as you can see that it's the same process but just applied itself to different things like contamination or health anxiety   Check out cognitive behavioural therapy     I would try a relationships forum instead  But if it only lasted a day I'm sure it's for the better  Tell him to learn from it and use it to focus on future relationships   Long story  I have a post in my history with details   9 years older than me  Met when I was 16 at my part time job  Emotionally and financially abusive and controlling  Almost 100  sexless and I wasn't allowed to complain about that or really anything  7 years of my life wasted  I'm still processing it but I have the tools to do so now  He was a very damaged person  Looking back with a clear head I think he may have suffered abuse early in his life but we never talked about it  He was legitimately addicted to porn and finding the extent of that and some finances was the last straw  Leaving destroyed me because I knew I had been his only friend for years and years and years and I didn't want to desert him but I didn't love him anymore and could no longer stay with someone dragging me down  I was depressed and suicidal for a long time because I didn't know how else to get out  We had just bought a house together and the day we divorced I was 24 and moved out of state and was still trying to sell our house  It was crazy stressful and my anxiety has never been higher  I broke up with my best friend boyfriend within a year of living here and hit rock bottom being completely alone  It's been a steady rebuild for about a year and a half alone here in Minneapolis but I'm very happy now  Happy lives take slowly building and some risk and a bit of luck  I am SUPER LUCKY more than anything   Do it and keep us updated  I'm still learning how to drive  but what helped me is that my dad just made me start and stop on a hill that's not too steep  If you'd roll back on this  it's really slow  The idea behind this is just exposure  Keep doing it in an area where there's no or little traffic until you know nothing bad will happen  You'll probably still be scared the first few weeks months  but that's okay  Fear is okay  In a nutshell  expose yourself slowly to steeper and steeper hill parks and driving  Take a friend with you  Use a diary and record your thoughts before for example   I thought I was going to die and fall back etc  Then record what actually happened  Read this everyday as you add new entries to your diary of success  And if you roll back   that's what the brake is for  perfectly safe  Good luck  At first I thought you meant it was a connect the dot puzzle that turned into porn or something lol  You can learn that your scary thoughts are not reality and reality will almost always work out better than you imagine   which you will clearly be able to see with your iary upon completion of a few entries   Thank you  I'm going to buy both books  I love reading  in English too     Here is my backpack flying home    http   imgur com DDUG78Z   There were days I had to be out of my hostel by 11 am and didn't leave for the next city until evening so I would carry it all day  I had a decent backpack  looking back I wish I had invested money into a real traveling backpack  Mine had 3 compartments  The hardest part for me as a somewhat high maintenance person was no hair dryer  My hair was short and was a mess most of that trip  I got a hot iron brush to tame it in the AM and showered at night in my hostel  The worst was shoes  I wore hiking boots almost everywhere but I had one pair of nice flats  I didn't have room for tennis shoes  With outfits I traveled city to city in my bulkiest items  boots and sweater jacket   I rolled all my clothes very tightly into cylinders and stacked them vertically inside my backpack  I kept a small umbrella in my bottle sleeve  I basically had a long blue blouse I wore almost everywhere over leggings  I had one t shirt for sleeping and a couple nice dresses that didn't wrinkle  I washed my clothes once when I was at a hostel with a nice laundry room  Sometimes I rewore undies and socks  yeah      For make up I just had the basics  foundation and some mascara and eyeliner and one lipstick  I did 4 cities on that trip so as far as clothes go  I wasn't too concerned about a variety  I had small baggies full of Tylenol or whatever in tiny backpack pockets  It was hard for me too cause I love being prepared   I totally feel where you're coming from here   I had a friend who went through a very bad couple of years and I ended up being one of her only supports    I didn't handle it very well  because I didn't take good care of myself while I was helping her     I think you're doing your best here   It is going to have to be on her timeline  when and if she fully heals from what happened   I know you have absolutely wonderful intentions  but I'm sure you also know that you can't rush or force her into behavior that she isn't ready for     Being open to listen and to provide support is so valuable   That alone can make a huge difference   I personally wouldn't be here without the support system that I had  although it was small   I'd say keep being that resource  keep growing yourself  and when she is ready to reach for a hand up she will know where to find it   I realize that probably isn't the answer you are looking for here and I wish there was some kind of cure for those negative feelings  but I haven't ever found it myself   just support and time  Been there  My last year of college was rough  I had no idea how I got by  You're gonna make it and it's going to be so worth it  Couldn't agree more or have said it better  I love it so much   Isn't he adorable  That's his soccer jersey    I totally agree with the last part you said  90  of the time there's no problem at all with going alone  But the last movie I went to see  Rogue One  and I'm a huge star wars fan  I really wanted to have someone with me to talk about the movie with after it was over  GOOD LUCK  That is also how I started  I did a week in Seattle alone fall 2015 and I was a mess the day before just picturing myself not going to the airport and missing the entire trip   I listened to an audiobook about anxiety and depression and people were interviewed in segments between chapters who had overcome it  The author goes "look at you  Now you're flying everywhere all by yourself  To the Philippines and all over the globe"  I thought  that's cool  Too bad that will never be me  I can't even get on a plane to go to a domestic city alone   Congrats  That's amazing  You just have to jump in and realize how capable you are  Go you   Where do you want to go   Could not have said it better  Once you get yourself there and realize you are capable it is the most liberating and intoxicating feeling to have CONTROL   The world is open beyond your work and neighborhood  It's huge and unlocked  The world is a playground now and everything is possible  Thanks  I'm really interested in finding out what worked for people  And the paid or free ones don't have much reviews  Either people with SA don't want to be linked to it or the online services don't have much traction  Or maybe they simply don't work  I would totally buy a connect the boobs No this is a great response  Thank you so much  I personally feel lost in helping her  so just even being told that listening and being there for her is helpful to her is helpful to me  sorry this is a mouthful  lol   I obviously don't go around talking to people we both know about what I should do to get her help  so I just felt feel really lost in all of this because I'm not sure if I'm actually helping doing enough  I question my own instincts in helping her because I'm not sure if it's the right thing    So yes  this is a perfect response      Thank you  again  I truly appreciate the honesty   For what it's worth  I've had this depression almost my whole life  I always thought it was a joke and that being a "man" you just deal with shit  For about 14 15 months I've been seeing a psychologist and the past 3 4 months a Psychiatrist for medication  NOTHING has been working and I'm starting to get pissed off and MORE anxious  I know both said it would be a process but my list of medication that doesn't work just keeps growing  It's frustrating to say the least    On the 24th I have some  6 hour test  Apparently this Dr is the best at what she does and will test for everything from ADHD to whatever else   I've been in and out of this sub forever reading and I never wanted to post but today I just don't care I guess  Maybe it'll help  We'll see    Anyway  my Psychiatrist was the one who recommended the testing because my medication wasn't working and a very close friend of mine takes Adderall and he said it changed his life  I asked for that and he said no  Then he asked if I would be willing to try some testing  I said of course  Then I got pissed because I'm wondering why he didn't ask me that from the get go    Long story short  it's going to be a process like others have said unless you get lucky  Good luck  too  I really hope you find something that helps  I wish I would of started earlier looking for help instead of pretending as a man I should just deal with it   Edit  Of all the shit I've taken  I've had no side effects  Although this last one required blood work after a week so after two pills I stopped taking it  I'm not taking anything more until after the testing  Coz anxiety is stupid  Your brain goes into fight or flight mode even though it doesn't need to  but if it did during the situations you mentioned  it would be right in doing so   I understand how you feel but quitting your job seems rather extreme in this case  Especially in this economy it's not easy to find anew job    Think about it  everyone was probably busy thinking about their own presentation  Did you know a day before that you will need to present  What helps me is to practice my presentation over and over so maybe you can try this as well  I am sure that other people didn't think anything about your "secret"  Next time you see your coworkers you can joke that you had "one of those days"   Great question  I got asked this a lot  Google com flights and kayak are great ways to investigate airfare  Planning ahead saves money  Airbnb  Hostelworld and Hotels com are great websites I used frequently to get cheap accommodations  If you can host couch surfers you can get a reputation on their website and stay for free too but I never have  I have a friend who puts all his stuff  rent  bills  etc  on a credit card and you can get cash back or miles to use  Often I would skip breakfast and lunch or hoard free breakfast items  I ate a lot of protein bars  Usually I only would eat out for dinner and my alcohol intake was very limited towards the end of the year  Personally  I got a promotion this year so money was better than in years past  I also got a different and much cheaper apartment this last fall to save money and adjusted my lifestyle a lot  I don't eat out very often  It's possible if you commit but I'm also very fortunate and lucky  I'm single income worth no kids and not wealthy by any stretch  but debt free and have worked my way into a great career  It was a very slow build  Edit  I used about 35 days of PTO in total  I would stack weekends and comp days when I used to work weekends  I did 3 days in DC on no PTO  I traveled no where my first year at this job and built up a large bank of vacation time   I'm sorry that you were triggered after enjoying yourself on NYE   Taking advantage of someone who is inebriated  having enjoyed a moderate amount of alcohol or a lot of alcohol  is a crime  An inebriated person cannot consent to sexual activity  This is  never  the fault of the survivor  Only the abuser is responsible for his behavior choices   Your experience on NYE is what  should  happen when some has enjoyed more than their limit of alcohol  Your partner got you home safely  got you into bed and cleaned up after you  Unfortunately during your prior experience someone felt entitled to sexually assault rape you instead of helping you to find a safe place and leave you alone to sleep it off   If you continue to have intrusive thoughts and distress you might try some grounding techniques  The one that I am most familiar with is to focus on what you can feel and name 5 things  then 4  then 3  2 and 1 thing that you feel  You can go through all the senses this way while slowing your breathing  You can look up other grounding techniques online   Take good care of yourself  The fucker decided to become an absolutist  I have tried that but it was no use  The very best you can do is to take baby steps and explore whenever you get the chance  You'll build confidence as you slowly find yourself in new situations and realize you didn't die     Even if it was super embarrassing  move on and learn  I find that building that skill was my strongest tool in overcoming anxiety  The thought of getting lost or stranded or losing my phone or wallet or rental car key is enough to make me stay inside and never leave  I also don't like crowds very much  I got over a lot of my social anxiety through forcing myself to do meet up  1  He doesn't do forums or Reddit  he is more of those who goes daily to gym  2  Everyone has  but he is still fucked up because of it  Thank you so much for the reply  I've never heard of occupational therapy before but I'm definitely interested  it sounds like something that could help me a lot mentally judging by your description of it  the same with befriending services  Maybe it'd push my family into giving me a bit of support with stuff too  who knows   I'd love to do something like go to the gym or go back to school and I appreciate the suggestions and support but you're right  it would be one of the bigger if not biggest steps for me and I have no doubt in my mind I'd end up having a panic attack if I tried it  and I've not had one of those for ages and don't really wanna break my record just yet haha  That'd be jumping straight into the deep end  plus extreme exercise triggers my fibromyalgia like nothing else  I can hardly even walk 100 meters without major pain at the moment so extensive gym use isn't an option at the moment    Housebound sounds like the right word to describe how I am  as much as I dislike having to admit that  Thank you so much for the advice and for taking the time to reply to me  I'll try and think of some small but slightly anxiety inducing steps for myself and work from there as soon as I have the time to  I do have things to do despite being housebound lol   I'll admit I'd been in a major depressive state for a couple days and when I posted this so apologies to everyone for how negative everything is  Of course you aren't imagining things hun 3 it's normal for survivors of sexual crimes and this DOES count as one to feel guilty or blame themselves  It's good that you're trying to remind yourself that you were not at fault  I am so sorry that you were out through this  It really is a shitty thing that he did    Is he still trying to contact you   Sorry  I am on the mobile app and can't read the original post to refer to it  so that's why I am asking   Does he only have your snap chat or does he also make attempts to text you contact you on the regular messaging apps   Thanks  that sounds really nice   It's software testing  with a little bit of development on the main project after I've been there a while    I can only hope it goes that well for me   Thank you very much    It will be good  What is the part that gives you the most anxiety  Is it getting and going through the airport or just the flight itself  Or the destination  Don't over think this  You absolutely did  not  overreact  Just think about how you'd feel if you hadn't called the police and something bad happened to the woman  When it involves looking out for other people it's always better to "overreact" than not react at all  You did good buddy  Feel proud    You're a good friend  You're trying to fix this for her and you're struggling because you can't  You'll never be able to fix it completely  It sounds like you're doing everything right  giving her resources  not judging her for not utilizing them  not pressuring her to get help  making sure she knows you'll always be there for her and that you want to help  It seems to me that you're doing everything right    Just keep in mind that her healing process may look different than yours  even though you endured similar traumas  It's okay to let her know that you're still concerned about her  Maybe tell her about some of the concerns you've written here    At the end of the day  remember that sexual assault is about power and control  Her power   control was taken away from her the day she was raped  So  as a support system for your friend  the best thing you can to is to try and give her as much power   control back into her life as possible  Encourage her to make her own decisions  even if you would do things differently  In addition to a great support system  she also needs to feel like she's in control    Haha I definitely need a better sleep routine  I actually got blood test results back recently that said I have a vitamin D deficiency from just how awful and late I sleep  That's something I'm constantly working on  although I slept earlier than usual last night and had the worst nights sleep I've had in ages so that's definitely going to take me some time   I hear a lot of good things about tea so I should probably try some new ones aside from regular black or green teas  Thanks so much for the suggestions  I'll be keeping them in mind  I'll check out that app too  People always say I'm young and have lots of time but it always feels like my time is running out somehow  it's a really awful feeling but just I think I'm just a bit paranoid  Thank you  I take hypnotic sleep medications  They help me let go of a portion of my anxiety before I fall asleep  They also make my memory of my dreams fuzzy and since I otherwise fight sleep  it's the only way I can keep a regular sleep schedule   I feel like I agree with that point  but also like I would extend that to other groups people as well  including groups other than white groups  It always seems like the small percentage of extremists grab any excuse they can to get crazy  and unfortunately those small groups get the majority of the attention  After watching that video I feel like that guy is a prime example  On a side note it's infuriating to see how much he relishes in creating conflict and drawing attention to himself  He has this expression that almost suggests some underlying issues  I hope things get better for you  As in  my roommates are all chill people who don't subscribe to extremist ideology   White supremacy neo Naziism "alt right" is also a form of identity and racial politics  which a lot of the thinkpieces I've read fail to acknowledge  If there's going to be criticism of identity politics  it needs to be balanced  I'm concerned about the safety of low income  immigrant  including undocumented   POC  Muslim  Jewish  Sikh  queer  and disabled people  I'm concerned about alienation  harassment  and bullying in schools  which is where a lot of my anxiety stems from   I'm concerned about policies that will harm institutions  communities  and individuals that have suffered for decades  For me  at least  these are all concerns regarding basic safety  dignity  respect  and well being  I want people to be able to live their lives without fear and with their civil rights intact   When it comes to crossing the political divide regarding identity politics  I'm not sure what the best option is for the left as a whole  At their roots  the demands of many activist movements and groups on this side of the spectrum are pretty basic  stop killing us  end hate crimes speech  etc   and it's difficult to separate those from identity as people are being targeted and harmed on the basis of identity  I'd like to read more on what people recommend for much larger and broader center left organizations like the DNC  which already has a lot of work to do regarding voter mobilization  internal politics  and candidate lineup IMO  Hey  That's a great idea  I started following you  my username is https   www instagram com alextakesonanxiety  if anyone else is interested feel free to follow me    I know this is meant to be funny but check lists of the most mundane "easiest" things help me when I'm at my most anxious  lack focus etc   This is beautiful  thank you for sharing    Do you have a sexual assault advocate who can stand by your side at court  If not  do you know if your local area has a women's center that offers court advocacy  Court advocates can be a huge help through a super nerve racking situation   You seem strong regardless  You should be so proud of yourself for going through the process  regardless of the outcome of the hearing  Stay strong  Cool  Yeah maybe try to aim for 10am or something like that  It's not that early  but not that late either  It's hard to motivate yourself  or at least myself  to get up earlier than that unless there's a good reason to  ie  work or school or whatever  There will definitely be an adjustment period though so it will probably suck for a few days or more  but long term it will be better for your life in general  Maybe to make it easier you could get up at 2pm for a week  1pm the next  and so on until you get to 10am   Regarding teas  just remember that herbal teas  like the ones I mentioned  are not the same plant as actual tea  Black  green  and white teas are all from the same plant and all contain varying levels of caffeine  while the teas I mentioned are all different plants and contain no caffeine  You might know that already  but I've come across a lot of people in life who don't know this so I figured I'd mention it  Gotta start somewhere   Since a period of 3 5 months a few years ago when I had a string of panic attacks  very intrusive thoughts about driving my car off the road during my commute  and intrusive thoughts of violently and vividly hurting people  I've really struggled with working  as I flash back and feel a strong fear of all those things happening again   I had successfully returned to work part time and then full time about a year after I quit that job  but I once again find myself working a part time job and hoping for a full time job   Today  I was planning on going out and applying to several retail places near me for work  but I'm finding myself glued to my house   I've worked in laboratory testing and never in customer service of any kind  largely because most of my work issues stem from social interactions   I gave myself until the end of the year to find something in my field before I resorted to customer service   retail type positions  so here I am   I've been feeling a lot of fear today   scared of being yelled at or berated by customers  of breaking down crying at work as I've done at every job I've had at least once  of having more panic attacks   In the long run  the next 6 months won't matter that much because I'm going back for a Master's degree in the fall  woohoo   Nervous and excited    I'd just like to earn as much as I can in the meantime  and I'm completely discouraged after filling out so many online job applications for the last couple of months   I'm very fortunate that I'm independently wealthy and live in my father's home  so I don't have the paying the bills anxiety that you have  although I do sincerely worry about money a lot  particularly due to how difficult securing a decent paying job is and how significantly a bad workplace can affect my mental health   The master's degree I'm going for is in a very hot field right now  Statistics   so I'm hoping to have a lot more employment options once I go through that program   I deal with this anxiety by taking an SSRI  seeing a psychologist  meditating  exercising  getting a kitten  and eating well   I've been slacking a bit on the meditating and exercising lately   I'm seeing my psychologist in a couple hours  so I can tell him about how I failed today and just try again tomorrow   Just taking things one day at a time   Hope you find some peace from your anxieties  Lol  Yes  I've been in the same situation but for me it was kind of a reassurance over me doubting whether I have OCD or not  In other words  I looked up types of OCD and as soon as I stumbled upon HOCD  I started doubting my sexuality  It was never as bad as yours BUT occasionally after masturbation I do perform a minor HOCD related ritual in order to make sure that I'm still crazy about women  This ritual is actual HOCD fear not a reassurance thing like the one I mentioned in the beginning         I'm a virgin  as well  so that might be a major factor contributing to the problem                     I know I can't give you direct help but keep in mind that you just found someone who occasionally experiences HOCD and yes  what you're describing is a symptom of HOCD  Definitely  Also  not liking men as much as before is a kind of a side effect from the psychological crap that you're going through now  I onced experienced existential OCD and faced derealisation in the end because of the anxiety I put myself through  It'll fade away  Be patient and don't overthink it  Hope I helped    After my ex and I broke up I sat down and wrote out every quality I needed from a partner  Some things were top priority while others would just be a bonus  I told myself that if those qualities weren't there then the relationship wouldn't last  You have to make sure your needs are being met    To give you some ideas  I wrote down things like "treats family well " Of course there are exceptions if the family is toxic but generally how they speak to their parents siblings is telling of how they'll treat you later on  Another important one for me was the ability to talk about science and philosophy in depth  I  need  someone with the same passion for learning as I have  I love to bounce ideas off of other people and hear different view points  But I also need someone who thinks farts are hilarious  too   Think about what's important to you  What do you desire out of a relationship  Write it down  don't settle for less when it comes to top priorities  Don't think about the qualities of your friend while doing this  just write what you want  It will help you determine if you should act on your feelings   Please know that it's possible to have a relationship when you have anxiety  My boyfriend of 5 years has panic attacks and GAD while I have ADHD  GAD and MDD  We're one of the happiest couples I know   So  I'd suggest digging deep and determining whether or not you'd have a fulfilling relationship  Then  wait a bit and see if you still have feelings for her    Obviously anxiety is impacting your social life so you should be doing things to aid in that if you aren't already  It sucks to have one person as your only support    I'm like you in that I'm distant in some regards  I'm much better now but I still find it difficult to be close with people  Aside from my boyfriend  I only have like three people I'm close with  Building up just one or two more relationships would help you immensely in regards of the fear of losing your best friend  That sounds horrible  But it's good to know that I'm not going crazy  It wasn't even a presentation  It was literally a 30 second update  I thought I could handle it but once I start talking I just immediately choked up  I've been fine before but don't know why I just totally bombed it  It's been that way recently and hoping to find some exercises to help  I saw some websites online but it's  99 a month for one on one coaching  Has anyone tried this   Thank you for replying to my post   I think Ativan is still one we haven't tried yet  I see my doc on thursday so I'll ask  Thank you  I meant YOU would have better luck posting in a relationship forum since  from what I can tell  this doesn't really have much to do with social anxiety  So you likely won't get many responses here  More detail would help if you do decide to post there  Kudos to you for trying to help out a friend   Alrighty then   I know how difficult perfectionism is as I experience it every day                      I'd say the best way would be to just forget about it  save it and keep it away until the day you'll apply with it  I know that this sounds like a stupid or meaningless suggestion but trust me  anything else leads to huge procrastination  You'll constanly feel the need to change every little detail              Also  why not give it to somebody else who's good at writing them  anyway  So  you won't only avoid bothering to make it perfect but also find time to relax knowing that somebody highly experienced has already prepared it for you way before the deadline  I'm so sorry this happened to you  It's so wrong what they did to you  You are incredibly strong   First off  I am super impressed by your boyfriend  It sounds like you two have a really healthy   trusting relationship  It's great to hear that you are able to talk to him about these issues and that he listens and is kind and willing to adapt to help you feel safe  That's just incredible    Are you suggesting that your discomfort in being a bottom stems from your assault  Or perhaps it's just not your thing  just like it's not your boyfriend's thing to be on bottom  Just a thought I had  I know you want to please your boyfriend sexually  but would being on bottom make you happy  too  It's okay not to want to do the things he wants you to do    Other than that  I'm not sure I can help you much  It may just take more time   more communication to feel comfortable and avoid flashbacks  Try not to rush it if you can  Baby steps      It's quite common that we only notice problems with compulsions when they get in the way of something we want  At that moment  it's like being in the middle of a 5K race and noticing you're out of breath  that you don't have the ability to continue the race  Your legs hurt and your lungs ache  The opportunity to build the ability to run the race was in the months and weeks before the race    So in situations like this  I find it useful to separate things like getting the resume completed from dealing with the anxiety  Learning the skills to handle anxiety is like building cardiovascular fitness  it's a long term practice    Getting the resume done is something you can do now  like finishing a race  but it'll be intense  It can help to make space for those intense feelings and expect them to be there  You can choose to feel them and not react to them  Feel panicked after writing a sentence and then write the next and welcome all of the anxious thoughts your brain throws at you  They're like sweat when running  it'd be weird if they weren't there  What matters is taking one step and then another    Another option is to hire a resume writer to finish the race for you and take this as a useful lesson that you need to start preparing for the next race by cutting out compulsions and learning to handle the stuff in your head before you're in need of those skills   Good luck with the application  I finally made an appointment with a therapist  I start on the 25th  Yes  My anxiety takes such a huge toll on me while at work  Exactly why i had to quit  I was being over worked and held to so many responsibility's that i couldn't handle alone  On top of that being one of the only few females around spiked my anxiety more because i felt like and im sure i was being watched constantly  I feel like i cant have a regular clocking in job anymore    Im trying to work from home but i still have trouble  I cant get my focus on my work cuz i worry about 100 other things  Im trying to quit smoking but i feel anxious at times because i know it helps me feel more calm    But also doesn't get me to be as super productive as i want to be  I feel like anxiety digs a huge hole in me that i don't know how to fill and i wish i could   thank you  it felt good         White supremacy neo Naziism "alt right" is also a form of identity and racial politics   Dude  Yes  Almost all these articles are written by white dudes  which makes the few written by   still men   non white man easy for center to right people to point to and say "he agrees with me" frustrating   and it's frustrating that the people who share these articles  again  men  don't seem to see that they're breakthrough is just an affirmation of the thing most people were already doing  and it's the thing that's easiest for white people to do  I mean  I'm white  and male  and it seems to painfully obvious that this is borne out of doing what's easiest  It's also throwing POC and immigrants and all the people the left claims to care about under the bus  defending you has become a political liability  so    good luck    Like  I agree that maybe not all racism needs dealt with the same way  The guy who tattoos swastikas on his forehead and burns crosses is not the same as the guy who thinks  "they just need to pull their pants up " and one of those guys might be talked out of his views  or the guy that thinks BLM is a "terrorist organization" might be able to be corrected  but if we refuse to talk about "identity politics " the pants guy and the BLM guy will only have their views reinforced or go unchallenged   And you hit it too  all politics are identity politics  all politics are personal  No one bans gay marriage or passes it because it's a nebulous idea  like the interest rate  something that we don't get to vote on  because it's not political  because it's not personal   it gets passed because it matters a whole lot to you  or it gets banned because it's deeply threatening on some level    In terms of moving forward  because as much as people hated Clinton  she would have probably been a better choice for people who voted Trump simply because they need a job  there does have to be some outreach  I think  I don't even know how to go about it  because historically white people have been all about moving minority rights forward until it rubs up against the boundary of other white people  and I balk at the idea of expecting  for example  a scared brown person "go make friends with a racist" for the sake of progress  There's a quote I can't find from Malcolm X telling his followers to ask white people what they thought of a particular guy from the Civil War  this guy fought for the Confederate  had a change of heart part way through  and then worked to free slaves specifically  but he had a very brutal life characterized by the slaughter of a score of white slave holders  Malcolm's point was that white people are all on board with civil rights    until they realize they might have to oppose other white people  and I think this "identity politics" backlash is a reflection of that  Have you tried rationalizing with yourself  You're very young and healthy  getting sick would be nothing more than a mild inconvience for you  in fact it would end up making you stronger as getting sick helps strengthen your immune system to make it fight germs better      Hello all   I've had a few minor anxiety attacks over the past few years  Never had an almost constant level of anxiety until I started my new job a few months ago  Previously I was responsible for my own success and answered for myself only  Now I've moved up and rely on others to do the work and answer for their mistakes  It's nerve racking and despite my bosses telling me how well I'm doing I'm constantly anxious depressed  I've made an appointment to see a therapist so hopefully that helps  Maybe he picked something up or just has a more sensitive stomach than you do  But just remember to make sure he bleaches the entire bathroom and make sure you wash hands before you touch food or your face  You can't catch it if he wasn't showing symptoms so when you were together the entire weekend you weren't exposed to diarrhea or vomit so your fine but now that he is showing symptoms just be careful with your hygiene  If it's from food no need to worry  If he feels like total shit then stay safe with bleach and wash wash wash your hands  You're right  but the complication currently is that the guy that the extremists are latching onto isn't doing a whole lot to distance himself  He's had some pretty open ended vague rejections  but they're pretty milquetoast  And having the president align  on some level  with your ideals  it gives you more credence than if some asshole talk show host agrees with you    And I agree that he looks like undiagnosed something  I think there's pretty convincing documentation out there that a lot of history's leaders have undiagnosed something  There's a book written about all our presidents that have had something diagnosable and kept it hush hush  Thank you  I try but then I think of how miserable it is and it just all goes out the window  I fixate too much on the physical feelings and can't get past the rest   Girl  you can do this  Believe in yourself  no matter how hard it may be  Focus on one goal at a time  you need money  period  Go to the interview  you never know  it might be a life changing moment  Take deep breaths  think about what makes you happy  No matter what the outcome is  if you get the job or not  you'll be one step closer defeating your anxiety  which in itself is a HUGE accomplishment  Remember  I believe in you  you believe in you  GOOD LUCK   3 In a way that is how video games help me  When I've shot an alien or beastie  it's like the feeling of popping bubble wrap  Pop  pop  pop  run  pop  Very satisfying and keeps my hands busy   That's a awesome idea  I'm in  Congrats on becoming sober   Anxiety can come out of nowhere with no known cause   I've been dealing with it for my entire life  and at times it peaks   What I can tell you is that right now you are probably at a peak  and eventually it will subside   You will feel normal again   It's hard to realize in the moment   I myself am also at a peak in my anxiety   Like you  I'm here to get advice   Sometimes even if you can't find a solution  talking about it helps   There probably is a cause to your anxiety that you haven't identified yet   I have been reading a book called the anxiety and phobia workbook which helped me to identify some of the things that cause me anxiety   I hope that you are able to identify whatever is triggering your anxiety  and that you will keep is mind that things will get better   Give it time    Im a 20 year old guy and have been struggling with bad health anxiety for about 5 years due to chronic pain and ringing in my ears  Doctors didn't know what was causing it so I started to assume the worse  I began to start having panic attacks and develop new symptoms in what I now suspect is a psychosomatic disorder  basically where you imagine symptoms but genuinely feel them   I had self diagnosed myself with MS  then moved on to cancer  then brain tumour  then diabetes  then schizophrenia  pretty much anything I could think of manifested itself with actual symptoms  It was terrifying as I would look up my symptoms and then see Disease X  and then experience all the other symptoms I read about leading me to believe I had the condition  You've just got to be aware when you're panicking that you have already identified the fact you have this compulsive worry and that you're most likely not sick at all  But if you get overly worried  the best way to alleviate that is to just go to the doctors and get them to verify that you're fine  I still get symptoms to this day  go in at least once a month  and they give me the all clear  As long as they're reasonable doctors they should be understanding  But maybe consider talking to a therapist or something about the anxiety as I got caught in a terrible loop and started getting panic attacks constantly  and that can cause weird symptoms and make you worry even more  I think I'm dying at some point at least once a week when I'm having a panic attack  It's hard to believe I could be so irrational in hindsight but that is how anxiety can manipulate your mind so it's important to see that as the root of your problem  I find this fear of illness I have is now very manageable if that's any encouragement  Everyone will worry about their health to a certain extent and that is normal  All the best  I'm glad you went to the doctor  that was a really important step  You could even try to get a counsellor or therapist  I don't know where you're from but here in Canada we can usually get that stuff covered by our health care system   Your life won't always be like this OP  It'll come in waves  and it will be something you'll always deal with  but you will have times of peace  I guarantee that   This is so crazy  I've had work anxiety on and off for the past few years and today I decided to see if Reddit had anyone experiencing the same problem  I don't necessarily have a high stress job   I work at a doctors office and it is pretty slow most of the time  I guess I have enough time to think and "freak out"  For some reason I feel like I need to run away and can't work today for whatever reason  My anxiety ranges from mild to panicky depending on the day   I try to distract myself and practice deep breathing techniques but some days this doesn't cut it  Yep  This x100  But  I actually in someways appreciate it  I have ADHD and  like most ADHDer's I can hyperfocus on boring tasks when it's down to the wire and there are severe consequences  I was a huge procrastinator  but I almost always got it done because I didn't want to let my parents and teachers down  I knew they saw me as a good kid  Fast forward to college when I was a faceless student in a lecture hall and only I know my grades  Needless to say they plummeted  The adrenaline I needed to focus came from the way overblown social anxiety  not the more legitimate fear of bad grades  Given that a lot of people with ADHD also suffer from social anxiety  it makes you wonder how much we could help by not treating them like dumb kids as so often is the case  If they know that you truly see them as smart and capable the consequences of letting you down may be enough to help them focus  Of course  this could backfire badly if you're expectations exceed their capabilities  I've been there too and it is crippling   Anyway sorry to go on a tangent  But yes  in general  I rely on that to keep me accountable but I imagine if I'd didnt have ADHD and were reasonably competent with executive functioning I may not appreciate it as much  Absolutely it can be useful to tackle that as part of all the other OCD crap    You only have one brain so it can be useful to approach all symptoms as one big pile of mental health  I'm very sorry that you have experienced such abuse as a child   Since your brain was not developed enough to process what you were experiencing memories of your abuse may have been repressed  The brain will do this in order to protect itself    Sexual assault rape are about taking power and control away from another person  It is not uncommon for survivors to recreate sexual experiences in order to attempt to be in control of the situation  This helps to explain your need to find older men who you wanted to hurt you sexually  You were trying to create situations where you might have the opportunity to regain a feeling of power and control over your body    I suggest that you look for a trauma therapist to consult with about your experiences  Someone who has training in this area will be able to help you understand your choices  properly process the memories in a safe environment and guide you towards healing and recovery  If you live in the U S  the RAINN website can direct you to a therapist in your area  with no fee for services   Or you could search online for a trauma therapist in your community or call a support line to ask about available resources  RAINN and pandys org offer online forums as well as other information   You are not alone and there are professionals who can help you when you are ready  Keep reaching out for support  You may also find help in the sub rape counselling   Take good care of yourself  There has to be some pro bono options avaliable for you somewhere  Im not in college  but do schools have counsellors  Maybe you can ask her him about it  Please please feel free to inbox me if you want to talk about anything ever at all or if you just need to vent   I might be totally wrong here  but I was under the impression that these things spread when someone v's or has d and doesn't clean themselves or their surroundings properly    Either way I think you'll be fine since you said your kiss was 24 hours before   I do not  The police told me two months ago I should be contacted by one but I haven't yet  They havent been the best at    Well  being helpful      Thank you so much  though  it means a lot to me  Is this saying we always make goals but just go get cereal instead  Lol Hey I had my first panic attack in June 2016 as well  a few days before my 20th birthday  I won't go into a ton of detail but it's been up and down  I quit my job  took a break from school  found a great psychiatrist and psychologist  have been held back by anxiety a lot  stayed in a mental hospital a few days  and have learned a lot about mental illness  To be honest if there is a silver lining it's that now I want to get better and be able to help others dealing with the same thing  and to eliminate the stigma    My best advice for you or anyone is 1  Books and 2  A good psychiatrist who knows what they're doing and can prescribe medication that can help immensely  Keep sharing your progress and good luck     You're welcome      I hope things are feeling better right now  And totally  IRL  I've found that more and more friends tend to have anxiety as I've gotten older  And it's been great  because we've all been able to learn from and help each other  And just be patient with each other   Yes  especially the urgency and awareness that something is off  and not trusting anyone  My bf almost feels like evil to me in those moments   I blurted this all out to him yesterday finally and he was like  what do you need from me  He's always supportive so that isn't really the problem  I just wanna find a way to prevent it from happening  I think I might need a new therapist bc I just don't feel a good connection w mine  thank you so much  It's reassuring to here that it's normal to feel those things as i often feel like something is wrong  Sometimes they can get super busy  especially if they are under staffed or rely on volunteers  Or maybe the police failed to let the advocates know that you wanted their services  Or maybe the police officer who told you that didn't know how the process works    I do court advocacy  and I know we aren't allowed to reach out to people  They have to seek services from us instead  They have to let us know that they want our help  So  maybe it's the same in your town   Or  maybe they're just unorganized and not helpful  Which sucks if that's the case  How do you feel about reaching out to the center yourself  Yes  it does   I have had it for a few years now   I think I am also depressed   It's hard to tell when you have PTSD because your feelings have a dampener on them after awhile   I can't cry  I think it's because I am always upset over something    That being said  I am doing better  I think    22 here  and fortunately I've at least experienced kissing twice and that was about it   no relationship though   I feel you OP  I used to get this bad feeling about how pathetic I am for still not experiencing something probably most people my age have and I'm just left in the dark  etc  You have two choices though   1  You can keep on dwelling on how pathetic your life is  how you're a joke  and that things will never get any better which will actually result in that as you go further and further into the vicious circle of self loathing all the time  or    2  You can accept that you have never been in a relationship yet even after reaching age 20 and just continue on living and trying to improve yourself  Remember  there are some people who have it way worse than us   I personally decided to go with  2 and break the vicious circle of beating myself up and started trying to improve myself  Started eating healthier  exercising  trying out new hairstyles  regularly watching YouTube videos on how to improve this and that  Also videos  pictures  quotes  etc  that boost the mood  There's still no relationship yet but we can't give up   Remember  there are some people who have it way worse than us  Apologies for the crappy english  Thank You so much for your reply  I truly appreciate you taking the time and value your advice  Its really good to hear someone tell me I'm just hitting a peak  I try to tell myself that too but it's much more reassuring hearing it from someone else who is going through similar issues  I hope you are able to find inner peace as well  Hey there  sorry you're not feeling to well    I know the holidays exhaust the crap out of people  with the lack of sleep and what not  Alcohol doesn't help anxiety  it dehydrates you and lack of water makes you stress out more    Drink lots of water first of all    You don't need to surrender to your anxiety  you just need to learn not to fear it  to be neutral to it  Kind of like mindfulness  acknowledge it and let it go  I know it's easier said than done    There's a self help book that's really helped me and I'm so grateful for  if you'd like I can lend it to you via kindle  May help you out on your trip   If they are really your friend  I'm sure it will be  Do you got a Discord or anything like that  Even if you don't regularly use it  it'd be nice to have  especially since MinerAp has a channel now  Plus its my most used way of communication  What a good idea  I also enjoy very structured video games  Prison Architect  Civ  where I end up doing nearly the same thing every time I play  but there are enough changes that it feels interesting  Or sorting organizing things   Those are all the symptoms of a panic attack  Every one you just described    I know it's scary having panic attacks  I developed health anxiety because of them  What made me feel better was going to the doctor for an evaluation to ensure me that there was nothing physically wrong with me  Don't be afraid to get a second opinion  At least then you know to rule out any health issues and know that it's your panic attacks    Remind yourself this is how you usually feel when you're having a panic attack every time you start to feel those sensations  They are familiar sensations   No he hasn't made an attempt to contact me  The last time we had contact I had told him that I wasn't going to sext him and that if all I was good for to him was sex and nudes that he could just stop contacting me  He said fine  and that he was done with me even though he wasn't using me  surprise  he didn't offer an explanation as to what he really is doing if he isn't using me after being confronted about it for the millionth time   That is so illegal and not your fault     A thing that my boyfriend does that I've borrowed is keeping a running list of expected outcomes and actual outcomes  You may not be able  right now  to stop the fear that someone has poisoned your food or your dogs have rabies  But perhaps after a while  if you can look back and see that you were afraid of that and it ended up being untrue  and that has been a consistent pattern over time  you will be able to calm yourself more easily when you have those thoughts    Another of my friends likes to just take the thought and run it to its full course and ask herself what the outcome would be  What would be the worst that happened if you were poisoned or died in your sleep  Being poisoned would suck  hard  But eventually  you'd get better or you'd die  and it would be over  Dying in your sleep would be tragic  But it would affect everyone else and not really you  you know  Depending on your belief system  you might be quietly gone forever  and therefore not suffering  Or you might be happily in the afterlife  and therefore not suffering  Going in your sleep is not a bad way to go    For me  it has been helpful to let go of the idea that one day the anxiety will just completely go away  I don't think  for me  at least  it ever will  and trying for the impossible is setting myself up for disappointment  However  I do believe that for almost everyone  anxiety can become manageable and that managing it shouldn't feel shameful  We don't look down on people with a broken leg for using crutches or with cancer for getting treatment  Don't shame yourself for doing whatever you need to do to manage your anxiety  and don't tell yourself it's hopeless or your a failure if anxiety still pops up  even when you're doing your best  Remember that you're doing your best and that it will get better    Do you mind if I ask what things  in addition to meds  you do to manage your anxiety   Have you seen a doctor for your anxiety  But I know how u feel  I had a job interview in the summer and a couples before I was gonna go I bailed out  Mostly because of the questions they'll ask  "Describe yourself"  etc  To me I find it pointless to ask questions like that and also makes me feel uncomfortable haha  But have faith in yourself  You can do anything you put your mind too  literally  All the " I cant's" and the nervousness are your brain telling you to fight or flight  But it's just a job interview  not life or death  It's okay to be nervous too  If you do go  just fake your confidence  Tell yourself you got the job  Good luck  When I feel like this  I try to look at the track records of the people I'm worried about and see if they come around at other times  when they don't need things  and how they respond when I need things  And if you honestly can't tell  if you have a friend you do consistently trust  perhaps you could ask them for some outside perspective    This stuff is tricky because anxiety does sometimes make us suspicious of people who aren't doing anything wrong  However  being in a situation with people who behave badly can make us think that manipulative behavior is normal or that we don't deserve better   Great job  You absolutely did the right thing  And thanks for sharing how you handled it  this will make it easier for me to know what to do if I ever find myself in a similar situation     You don't need to surrender to your anxiety  you just need to learn not to fear it  to be neutral to it  Kind of like mindfulness  acknowledge it and let it go   I really like this advice  The key to anxiety is understanding your your triggers  listening to what your body is telling you  and responding appropriately    You can attend but talk to your teacher about your anxiety so that way your teacher understands your needs and can support you  Having an anxiety buddy can also help if you feel comfortable enough confiding in another classmate  And bring things that help you de stress  your favorite pillow  book  earbuds for music  or pre load some shows to your electronic device    When you feel like you need to recharge   let your teacher or anxiety buddy know how you're feeling and that you need space      Drink lots of water first of all    And this   100 times no  It is not your fault   I haven't because I can't afford to   which is the whole point of the job  Awful cycle really  Anxiety stops me from working but I need to work to be able to afford to treat it   heh  I'm still really not sure I will be able to get through this yet  but the clock is ticking  That's what I used to think about myself  Too weird  too neurotic  too fucked up and insecure  I think it's almost never true about a person  though  We all have our good points  and we're all lovable  and that includes you  You have people who care here     It really helps to connect with other people like on this subreddit      I've wondered this  too  My anxiety always seems to settle down in a crisis  It's like my brain has been expecting this all along and now it has somewhere to direct all that energy  It's when there's nothing big to deal with that my brain starts wondering what the next crisis will be and freaking out   Would you mind at all telling me what form of meditation it is   Some are soooo helpful  others are actually anything but   If you live in the US they have them at 5 Below   and they're usually around  2 4     Something my boyfriend does that I admire is that he just owns who he is and what he does  And because he just owns it  everyone accepts it  For a lot of my life  I've been a person who is constantly cringing and apologizing for everything I do  feeling like everyone knows that I'm a screw up and is judging me  The thing  though  is that every single person makes mistakes  and stupid ones    How people react to our mistakes is largely determined by how we react to them  If we act like we're stupid  other people will believe us  If we shrug it off or laugh  they generally will  too  Most of becoming a confident person  I think  is being able to act like one  It's okay if it's fake for a while  Just remind yourself that other people have struggles  too  and if anyone is judging you  that's their problem  Practice being okay with yourself  Problem is that for me  digging deep would entail analyzing things indefinitely and never deciding to do anything  I'd love to just like get a big circle of close friends RIGHT NOW so I could have more social support  and not be so addicted to talking to one person  I'm worried about waiting too long   even though she'd be cool to keep as a platonic friend as well    I have a really vain hope in the back of my mind that she'll hit on me so that I'll be forced to make a decision  Thank you   Saving    What boots did you wear    Next time  spread everything out and take a pic  I saw this done but was a guy and I want to know how a woman like yourself would pack so light   Thank you for the kind words  Of course I have an incredibly hard time believing this at 28 years but maybe there's hope   Betterhelp com  Don't know if they specialize though thank you  is it normal to feel those things all the time even when im not having a panic attack  it's scary I often isolate myself during anxiety flare ups  People who don't have anxiety think of it as simply just feeling a bit nervous  I can't be around people who don't understand and say clich shit like 'stop worrying'  Or worse  the people who get so uncomfortable that they don't know what to say so say nothing   I find isolating myself and using forums such as this to get through the worst is by far the best option for me  I can just lay in bed for hours and not have to answer to anyone or pretend everything is fine   The only person I ever genuinely want to be with when I'm feeling anxiety is my boyfriend  He is such a calming influence on me and so laid back that all my symptoms start to go  It's just a shame we live 80 miles apart and I only see him once a week   Anxiety is isolating in its very nature  so being here  discussing it with like minded people is the best place for you  I hope this offers some comfort xxx i hope it all goes well for you  good luck     Like  I agree that maybe not all racism needs dealt with the same way  The guy who tattoos swastikas on his forehead and burns crosses is not the same as the guy who thinks  "they just need to pull their pants up " and one of those guys might be talked out of his views  or the guy that thinks BLM is a "terrorist organization" might be able to be corrected  but if we refuse to talk about "identity politics " the pants guy and the BLM guy will only have their views reinforced or go unchallenged   Yes  From my observations  there are two types of "ignorant"  ignorant but maybe willing to listen  and ignorant and hostile  The first step in these types of situations is to figure out what kind of audience is being approached    It's also throwing POC and immigrants and all the people the left claims to care about under the bus  defending you has become a political liability  so    good luck    I balk at the idea of expecting  for example  a scared brown person "go make friends with a racist" for the sake of progress   I agree  After the election  I questioned my habit of exclusively sticking around people involved in or at least sympathetic to anti racist  anti xenophobic  pro LGBTQ  etc movements until I reminded myself that it's for my own safety  It doesn't make sense for me to willingly put myself in danger for the sake of progress when the whole point of White supremacy  for example  is the idea that my voice is not worth listening to  that my existence in this country is unacceptable  This is why I think White people are important in moving anti racist work forward  Sometimes more privileged allies  White  straight  cis  neurotypical  etc   can be misguided or ill informed or merely part of movements in order to get attention or to collect cultural capital  but I rarely encounter these types of people  All in all  I'm grateful for the people who truly go out of their way to listen to others  examine their own actions and beliefs  and make changes however they can for the sake of peace  Thank you for being kind  especially online where it's so easy to be hostile  It means a lot these days  When I don't have good friends around in person and am worried I'll rely too much on someone  I look for penpals  There are a lot of cool people out there you can talk to to fill some of your social needs without relying entirely on one person  If you are able to find some additional friends  whether in person or through writing  that might let you get some perspective on how you feel about your best friend and whether you'd like to take things further  It might also be useful to have a journal  just to have a place where you can think things through on your own sometimes   Another thing I've done in the past  because I have been lonely and do fall wildly in love with people very quickly  has been to stop and think about the person I'm having feelings for and determine whether there's anything right now that I'm only putting up with because of the infatuation  If there's anything that you feel like you're tolerating right now that you know will drive you nuts later  that may be an indication not to take things further  If  however  all the things that are problems right now seem like they'd still be manageable and worth dealing with once infatuation wears off and things become more normal  maybe it's worth pursuing   This is the mental check I used before pursuing things with my current boyfriend      Hullo    I completely 100  understand how you feel   I started getting panic attacks as a result of death anxiety at the age of about 9  I'd felt fine for a while but then all of a sudden the holidays hit and I fell back into the hole  I'm 21        It's such a horrible experience  and one that I've only just realised is actually a problem and needs addressing  rather than just a normal way of thinking  My doctor put me on propranolol  which is great for calming down the physical effects of a panic attack   it doesn't do much in terms of calming down the intrusive thoughts  apart from maybe a bit of a placebo effect  I've found myself feeling overall calmer but the thoughts aren't completely gone  but would recommend if you're ok with the idea of medication  There's also the option for SSRI antidepressants  but doctors tend not to prescribe these unless you've tried therapy and counselling too  well that's how it works in the UK at least     Basically  I've found being open about my feelings to particular people to be really helpful   like speaking to medical professionals and university counsellors etc  but I think it is just a case of trial and error  Different behavioural therapies meds general stuff work differently for everyone  it's just a case of working out what that is    Sorry for the long long lost but feel free to message me anytime because this is a really horrible thing and it's nice to know you're not alone sometimes        cee  3   imsoproudofyou Exactly  No kid is suffering if they're starting out born in America  They may not have their own ipads but they have a mom who reads to them religiously before bed every night and they go to bed dreaming of the stories I've told them  not the material things they want  You have an anxious fear of death because no matter what anyone does or says  it's going to happen  I went through a phase like this for about a year  Apparently  it's something that all twenty somethings go through  When they realise their own mortality  they obsess about it for quite some time  I'm 32 now and although the thought of it still scares me  both the process and what happens after it  and the idea of absolute nothingness  and me not existing at all  I've accepted it's going to happen  so I really need to make the most of my time here  Worrying about it ruins that time  It's like worrying about the sun coming up tomorrow morning  It's going to happen and you'll waste every day being miserable about it   I would say that my worrying about death itself has reduced but I worry about things now that could result in death  For example my health and driving in my car  I'm not a risk taker at all for this reason  I get that  For what it's worth  I'm 34 and only now in my first healthy relationship  I had a long term relationship before that  but we were pretty awful to each other  and I left it feeling like I was physically disgusting and emotionally off putting  as well  I mean  why else would my husband be unable to love me and be attracted to me  and my family treat me so unkindly    Honestly  what helped me get over it with dating was just going out and having a string of casual encounters  If people actually wanted to sleep with me  I couldn't be as disgusting as I thought I was    Funnily enough  that's how I met my current boyfriend  One of those encounters ended up being someone I really connected with  who was interesting and fun and just treated me really well  Having someone I was into treat me with respect and kindness helped me to see myself differently    Even before we started dating  though  I had been working on thinking differently about myself  reminding myself that everyone has problems  and mine don't make me any less of a person than anyone else  Taking some time to do things that are just for me  not for anyone else  and working on validating my worth as a person  outside of what anyone else thinks  has also done a lot for me and helped me to be able to not torpedo this relationship through my self doubt and massive insecurity    I guess what I'm trying to say is I know it's hard  But if I can do it  you can  too  Remember that you're a good person and worthwhile  Not every romantic attempt will pan out  and that's not about you  If you feel like looking  eventually you'll find someone  And best of luck  I know it's addictive  and yes this is in combo with other meds I was prescribed  despite about 2 3 years of saying no to being medicated    I am very cognizant of the fact that Xanax is extremely addictive and I was have been open with my doctor about being worried about that  Both my doctor and therapist agreed on this line of treatment   I have friends with anxiety who take 2 mg a day and seem to think it's normal which I think is fucking insane   I worry about taking my small amount  idk how they live with themselves taking so much  I'd be petrified   I wouldn't recommend benadryl at all for anything   I'm in the UK and I've been on SSRIs for a year and half now and never seen a councillor or therapist since the NHS waiting list is at least 12 months xx Apply for free health insurance  I'm sure you could get it or talk to someone close and ask for some help with your anxiety  Trying to make friends with her is the best way to go  People in this situation need to know someone cares about them  even if it's just the new neighbor who is friendly and makes them feel safe  Once you can establish a bond of trust with her then you can talk about the abuse you hear  but definitely don't predicate your interest in her on trying to help her  She may tell her abuser and that will make it worse  Are you seeing a therapist   I ask because it sounds like you already have a diagnosis of PTSD   If you are  this is a good thing to bring up with them   If you can  be patient with yourself   A lot of times the mind just pulls up memories that have been put to the side because of trauma on a case by case basis  when it feels able to handle them or safe enough to grieve   It's impossible to rush or force that  thank you   really helpful    Great advice  In addition to solving the immediate need  it also reinforces the belief that you are worth caring for  which I find helps me   I'm glad when you told your boyfriend  sometimes I just blurt stuff too  it was well received   Good luck in your therapist search  I've always heard of doctors not prescribing SSRIs until everything else has been tried so that's super useful to know thank you    Every now and again I go through a period of death anxiety where I'll think about it and have a panic attack  The unknown is scary  I'm not sure how much this will help you   but I know it has sort of helped me  at least for now    In the book "Slaughterhouse Five" by Kurt Vonnegut  I definitely recommend it   the main character is supposedly kidnapped by aliens who believe that instead of time happening in a linear fashion  everything that has existed does exist  and always will exist at some point in the fabric of time  And this got me thinking that I actually agree with that  albeit from a fictional book  We all have our little mark in the universe and we all exist somewhere in time  This way of thinking alleviates the "I'm gonna be dead and gone" feeling a bit for me    I know it's hard to think about these things  especially when you have anxiety  But we're all in this together at least  I hope this helped at least a little    hugs    No one but you gets to make the decision of whether you live or not  Personally  I think things can almost always get better  and anxiety almost always lets up  I just lost someone because they felt the way you did  I hope that you will let yourself believe there is hope  and I hope that things will get better for you    I don't know you and I don't know your situation  Maybe it is really that bad and always will be  But for me and everyone I've met who were in bad places and suffered from anxiety  the key was changing the situation or reframing it or reaching out for help  There was always something good in their life  or the possibility of something good  even if the only person willing to provide the good thing is ourselves   Wishing you all the best  I hope you are able to find your way through this and find a way to alleviate your suffering and find some peace without killing yourself  This is awesome  Firstly  movies are a way better solo activity since you have no one to bother you with questions and interrupt the movie  As you keep going you will get more and more comfortable doing it  You should be really proud of yourself  I found this article is really great about why we should all get over this stigma of doing things alone  http   blog tranqool com 2016 11 07 ditch the stigma of doing things alone  utm medium Reddit utm source Reddit utm term stigma alone I have health anxiety as part of general anxiety disorder  It's just another on a list of things for me to worry about  My main concern is having a heart attack or cancer  I get heart flutters and irregular beats as part of the anxiety  for no reason and at any time  So this contributes to my conviction that I'm going into heart failure   I even get so convinced that I think the doctors have misdiagnosed me and that I'm gonna die of a heart attack and end up in the local news as a medical negligence and misdiagnosis case  Genuinely concerned about that happening   Anyway  as far as medication goes  I am on beta blockers  which helps to combat the physical symptoms  Taken twice a day  I am also on fluoxetine  an anti   depressant  to combat the psychological symptoms  They have helped me a lot  as I took myself to ER three times when I first started experiencing anxiety attacks  I've been once since  A word of warning though  anti   depressants will make you feel even worse for the first couple of days or weeks  The side effects are awful and you'll want to give up on the medication  But I pushed through it this and I feel a lot better since my first attack  Small steps lead to really great results  Setting these kind of realistic expectations for yourself are really helpful  Celebrate these small victories   It is hard to have someone leave and it will be a big change  There is the chance things will change between the two of you  Personally  I would try to take at face value his desire to continue the relationship  and see how things go from there  Video chatting is a good way to keep in touch  and if you already have an internet connection  it's free  LDRs are a lot easier than they used to be    The other thing I've done when I've been worried that my boyfriend would leave me has been to remind myself that even if he does  I'll be okay  It would hurt to lose him  But I would still have a lot of other good things in my life  things that are under my control  and I would eventually go out and meet someone new   Thanks so much for the reply  yeah  i do get a bit of heart anxiety too and experience some of those things  im glad to hear the meds are working out good  That adjustment period with meds and feeling worse is what im most nervous about  Hey OP  really awesome that you are dedicated to doing this  I found this article is really helpful for building self esteem  Hope it helps  http   blog tranqool

really like that  We all have our mark in time  It also helps me to acknowledge that every single person we encounter in our own lives won't exist either  Nobody in 2100 will know our entire global society  It makes the whole thing seem less lonely and something we will all face together xx Looks like I got myself a therapist next week    Please do not feel bad about calling  You did the right thing  Too many people will not call 911 because they are afraid to be wrong or to waste the police's time    I was once staying with a friend in motel on a beach  The room above us    furniture was being thrown  loud voices  a kid screaming  My friend did NOT want me to call 911  fear of retribution   But I did  Apparently there was some bad stuff going down in that room because there were cops swarming all over and a few even took off hell bent for leather when a car peeled out of the parking lot    I feel like I might have saved a child  saved a person who was being abused     might have broken up a meth ring  Who knows  I am glad I called and you should be too    Too often when someone is in need  too many people stand around afraid to do something about it because they think someone else will and that they are not qualified to do anything  Don't fall into that trap   Damn can I relate to this  Not sure what to tell you because I'm in the same boat but keep being strong and keeep fighting your SA  It's perfectly fine to have off days  everyone experiences them  Just gotta find  the strength in you to get up and keep going  Maybe consult an OCD specialist  Both my boyfriend and I have anxiety and struggle with how we feel about our appearances  It doesn't have to stop you from having a relationship  Personally  I think pretty much everyone is lovable  That includes you    A couple of years ago  I ended a long term relationship where both of us had made each other feel awful about ourselves  I left feeling like a disgusting human being  physically and emotionally  For me  the answer was a combination of spending some time working on my beliefs about myself  reminding myself that everyone has problems and makes mistakes  everyone has needs  I am as important as anyone else  etc    and having a lot of casual sex  I know that  just the way the dating market skews  that may not be as viable a solution for a guy  It was helpful for me to see that there were people who would were willing to sleep with me and spend a little time with me  If you can do some casual dating for a while  perhaps that would help  If you can't  that's okay  too  Just remember not to sabotage yourself when you do date or spend time with friends  Don't tell yourself that the people you're with are probably doing it out of pity or obligation  They're not  If they keep showing up  it's because they want to  If they act like they like you  it's because they do  If you can remember that  it will make it easier to find a relationship  I think  It has for me   You're welcome  I didn't get any symptoms with the beta blockers until I had my dose increased   Then I started to sleepwalk and talk  Eventually my body got used to it and that stopped too   It's the fluoxetine that was the worst  I would have adrenaline rushes every time I was dropping off to sleep  so eventually I became scared to fall asleep and stayed away until I pretty much passed out from tiredness  This lasted about 10 days  I went to the doctors about it after day 5 and he just said 'yes  you'll feel worse before you feel better'  It did really suck but the pay off has been worth it   I had tried two other kinds of anti   depressants but the side effects were so bad that I had to switch to something else  I just kept throwing up all day on those two   I can honestly tell you that getting through the adjustment period is nowhere near as bad as living with full blown anxiety all day  every day xxx Sometimes the transition to college is just overwhelming and in a bigger community there are less people taking note of you withdrawing  It becomes very much up to you to make the effort and this can be difficult especially if you already have some trouble with social interaction  You say you enjoy the one close friend that you share a lot of similar tastes with  maybe they have some other friends you might like  Or try joining a college club for something you like  If you find yourself really withdrawing then maybe seek some help  A therapist can help you either get to the root of this or develop new skills   ahh okay  that's really helpful  thank you so much for telling me your experiences  This is really great  I am so glad to hear other providers are increasing accessibility  All our services are online because honestly it is sometimes so difficult to get to an office   Yes  I don't ever have the classic panic attack anymore  I don't hyperventilate  I don't have a racing heart or feel dizzy  I just get heart flutters  followed by pins and needles for absolutely no reason  even if I'm just laying in bed watching a movie  That's what makes it so scary  Because you're thinking 'I can't be having a panic attack because I'm not scared right now  ' Xx This is super common  People with anxiety have trouble shutting their brain off and if you have a stressful job that can just add to it  To be honest though if you didn't have the job your brain would probably find something else to worry about  Maybe try some relaxation techniques to help calm your mind before bed  I find this one particularly helpful  http   blog tranqool com 2016 02 01 do this 1 thing to

of the good or bad opinions of others"  I'm not Sure if it'll have a significant effect on you but I tell myself that same line throughout the day  truly internalize it  and I noticed it has really helped me   I am  I have PTSD for other reasons as well   This is a new development  and it was Xmas then NYE break so I couldn't see her until this week    I'm trying  I'm trying to put the feeling out of my mind but my bf is starting to ask questions to which I have no answers  I don't remember my childhood at all but you know that nagging feeling  It's really bad and gives me anxiety  It's terrible   I don't have full blown OCD  but I do have many of the symptoms  I've spent a lot of time wondering whether I might be bi  While I haven't had the same experience  I have had some women I've been very close to and loved nonromantically  and I have wondered whether I would be interested in them romantically  For me  it has come down to just running that scenario through in my head  what would it be like  to be with one of those women romantically  How would it make me feel  For me  the conclusion was that I just am not into women sexually    If your conclusion is that you're not into guys  then you're not into them  Feeling close to someone doesn't have to mean wanting to sleep with them  If you did want to sleep with them  that would be okay  too  For me  part of dealing with intrusive thoughts is refusing to give them the weight they want  Okay  that thing I'm afraid of could happen  Most of the time  it wouldn't actually be a big deal   Honestly that's really not  that  bad  I've heard of many guys and gals who never get into any up until their early 20's and they have no problems whatsoever with it  It's not too late   I'm the same actually  gonna be 20 in less than 1 month and I never have either  not because I never had a chance  but because I've got personal issues  Currently in intensive therapy now to try to cure myself of all my issues before it's too late  you should do the same     I've never been kissed either   not even on the cheek  Good  good  let the anxiety flow through you   Seriously   you will need the adrenaline from the second you step off the bus   If you were just like 'meh ' I'd be worried      But also  I can bet that every  Single  Recruit  Is feeling just like you right now  So know this  within 24h of arrival you will know all the people in your section and feel like you belong with them   Secondly   you will be so busy  tired  and adrenalized  you won't have time to think or worry about anything     This is going to be the start of something great  a lifetime defining moment   As far as I can see  the anxiety is both justified and necessary   normal and reasonable      Just do the best you can at any given moment   don't let your mind wander even during apparently 'downtime'  and remember the reason you are going is to BE trained  i e  they will give you guidance every step of the way    And after it's over  you'll have made some of the best friends you will EVER have in your life     Respect to you  It doesn't sound like you have much of a choice so try not to feel too bad  I'm sure they will find him a home  It can really help to challenge your thoughts  When you have anxiety these thoughts come up and we really have trouble controlling them  If you start looking at them with a critical eye it can help    For example  dogs have rabies therefore I will get rabies     really think about this for a moment  all puppies  unless they are stray  have been vaccinated for rabies so if the dog has an owner they're not going to have rabies  This takes practice but it can be really useful   This video is great for explaining the negative thought biases  https   www youtube com watch v sA0qcELeGl8 t

extraordinary and your happiness shines through    Traveling is something we often fear and tell ourselves we don't have time for but a new year means new changes  so I find your post very inspirational   Here's to an amazing year    I've finally been diagnosed with GAD after two years of taking myself back and forth to ER thinking I'm having a heart attack  It came to blows when I had what can only be described as a breakdown one day  I woke up and from the minute my eyes were open until about 11pm that night  I had palpitations  Fluttering heart beat  skipping beats  doing one big massive thump all day  I thought I was going to die  I did nothing but cry and frantically pace the house trying to get it to stop  I had no idea why this was even happening as there was no trigger  That's what makes GAD so life ruiningly scary  How can you be panicking when you have nothing to panic about  It MUST be a serious medical condition   Anyway  that night I took myself to ER and they kept me in overnight cos I was thinking about hurting myself  I've never felt so low in my life  I finally got to talk to someone and have a proper diagnosis  which has since led to proper treatment  My anxiety symptoms have greatly reduced since then   But yes  the fear of it building back up to that extreme is always there  People say don't fight a panic attack  just let it happen  way easier said than done and almost always ends up in complete exhaustion and feeling defeated   GAD is horrible  It's like having two voices in your head arguing constantly  One is rational and calm  the other is irrational and frantic  When I'm having a bad bout of anxiety  that irrational voice is always the loudest  Worst case senario is always the most likely outcome when that's in charge  I don't know what you went through  exactly  and it might be more severe than what I suffered  I'll give you advice based on how I experienced things  The first thing you'll want to do is prepare yourself mentally   Writing about your abuse means confronting and reliving it  to an extent    From there  just write whatever comes to mind It's fine if it ends up as a nearly incomprehensible stream of consciousness at first  You can polish it later    The important thing is getting everything   your thoughts  emotions  and perception   down on paper    Sounds good      The office isn't too far  but it's because my mom is working late and can't take me  and my sister can't take me because it's a bit late For me it is  I probably couldn't cope with my anxiety   depression without meds   lol not even on the cheek  You did the right thing and I'm glad you're proud  as you "should" be   Who knows how bad it might have gotten if left alone  you never know  that's the sad thing   If only more people would do stuff like that  the world would  be a better place to live in  Good on ya and what a great way to start the New Year    Keep up the fantastic work   And i bet it will inspire others  wait scratch that  because it looks like it already has  Stuff like this saves lives   had one or two on the cheek but never the lips  Talk to her  Try to remind her what sort of person Jack is  Try to explain what a person like him would do to a child    But understand that she might not listen  When I was with my ex  my friends spent three years telling me how toxic a person she was   It wasn't until she violated a major boundary that I realized they were right  and cut ties    The most important thing is that you continue to support her   This article on CNN explains it a bit better than I can   http   www cnn com 2013 01 10 living friend domestic abuse    Thanks   I haven't had any casual encounters in almost five years because I'm super scared about STDs and HIV and the like  Guys don't seem to really be interested in me other than really old guys that are out of shape  and I've had no luck on any dating sites or get any matches  I feel like all I'm good for right now is someone who needs to get off and are super desperate and not appreciate me at all    But I read everything else you said and it sounds great  I hope so    That's not too bad but so many people have trouble getting help because therapists work very restricted hours  or are unaffordable  I am so glad you found something that works for you  Based solely off your description  it sounds like you could be shy introverted  when you're in public or with many people  do you ever feel yourself getting sweaty  heart racing  or mind blanking out  Also  any feelings of avoidance or any other physical ill feelings  Those are more symptoms of social anxiety  If you just have an actual preference for solitude and smaller social niche  that's not social anxiety   I would recommend recording evidence of this if tries again and reaching local authorities for a restraining order  These kind of posts make me happy  Makes me feel like it's not all doom for us SA sufferers  I  too  am feeling good about this year  Good luck    I agree  there are ways out  Just gotta find what method works best for you I had a friend who had been molested and "sold" a lot at a very young age  She lost her vaginal virginity when she was 6  She had a strange sex life  but had learned to empower herself  She began working with the mentally handicapped  where I worked  and was amazing with them  She just had her first child a year and a half ago  She is a little older than you  but I guess what I'm saying is that eventually  you can start to accept that as a part of your past  but you can have hope that it will not define who you are and who you become  I understand that it was a 30 seconds speech but can you practice it at home in advance  I get exactly the same way especially when everyone is watching me  Most of the time people are busy thinking about themselves so they wouldn't notice that you feel awkward  I know it's easier said than done but keep working on yourself    You cannot quit now because maybe you will be faced with the same problem at your next job  I haven't tried one on one coaching but I am planning to join improv class  I hope that it will help me not to freeze during moments like this   Is that    Harambe  I scare off women all the time  I'm either too forward or they lose interest because I'm too nervous to make a move  Sometimes my nerves overpower and I shutdown  I try to explain to my friends  but they don't understand how troubled I am with it they just think I'm in the closet  It really gets me down not being wanted   I have a bathroom in my room but I still take off all my clothes even when I just have to pee  I clean my bathroom myself yet I still don't feel comfortable with my clothes touching certain areas in the bathroom   I just drink less water when I go out so I won't have to go to a public restroom   It's a nightmare but I was worse off before and I'm slowly starting to cross off OCD rituals but this remains the most difficult for me   Could this also happen to a girl  I feel the EXACT same way  I make sure I have a relaxing nighttime routine   Right now  this includes showering at night  smelling lavender essential oil  and progressive muscle relaxation   That got rid of the night terrors and reduced nightmare frequency from nightly to weekly   Prazosin has been super helpful for me recently and has made the nightmares I do have much easier to deal with  I was bullied really badly all through every year of school so I constantly asked myself those questions  Then  as an adult I moved to the city and realised I was likeable and attractive and actually pretty cool  People actively sought my company and affection   So nowadays  I genuinely do not care what people think of me  Because what is a thought  It's someone else's own voice in their own head that I can't hear  So why am I even worrying about it  It's literally unnoticeable unless they speak it  If they speak it  then there is a problem  and 9 10 it's theirs  For example   someone doesn't like how I look  Simple answer  don't look at me then  cos the people in my life who's opinions matter think I look just fine  and how unhappy are you in life that someone elses face creates such hatred  Don't be defined by strangers  because you will never please everyone  Always listen to the ones closest to you who genuinely care    I don't get sucked in by trolls because they don't matter  All you need is that extra boost of self esteem and nobody can hurt you unless you let them xx I feel you  I really do  But 3 weeks   You gotta realize these feelings and thoughts are INSIDE YOU   There is literally nothing threatening about the job  the people or the company   It is all a matter of perception    So go back on the hunt  but don't quit   Put your shields up  find humor wherever it can be found  don't cut yourself off from help or friendship  but don't let the aholes get to you   And especially  don't become one    You are a round peg in a square hole   it is up to YOU to find a 'dream job'  Recruiters just want to make a buck  they literally do not care    You can rise above all this by KNOWING in your heart that it's not forever  and you will find something great       Yes  From my observations  there are two types of "ignorant"  ignorant but maybe willing to listen  and ignorant and hostile  The first step in these types of situations is to figure out what kind of audience is being approached   Yeah  This is kind of a mantra I've been repeating over and over to all my "gonna unfriend the Trump supporter" friends  I  as in  "I u JesusHMontgomery"  was a shitty white person for a long time  I wasn't about to tattoo a swastika on my forehead  but I did think that maybe "they just need to pull up their pants " and if it wasn't for some long suffering  no doubt very frustrated  individuals  I'm not sure I would have ever stopped thinking those things  The kind of change people want to see comes from gentle friendship  not from excommunication   though sometimes a person is that toxic that's the only option you have     until I reminded myself that it's for my own safety   Yeah  and that's where it gets dicey for non white people  I feel like there's the potential  if things become the worst case scenario that I fear  that white people won't get instant protection  like they do now  But it's already dicey for non white people  There's this link floating around about this black man that has convinced something like 200 KKK members to leave the KKK just by being their friend  It is  genuinely  inspiring  and heart warming  and I'm so glad that man exists  but I think there's an implied narrative in the way the internet  read  Reddit  has been spreading it like wildfire  this guy is one of the good ones  and thank god  because otherwise I might have to talk to them     Sometimes more privileged allies  White  straight  cis  neurotypical  etc   can be misguided or ill informed or merely part of movements in order to get attention or to collect cultural capital  but I rarely encounter these types of people    This is a relief  I often read pieces online about opportunistic "woke" white people  or faux feminists  I personally haven't encountered any  but I learned that my reality tunnel is pretty narrow currently      Thank you for being kind  especially online where it's so easy to be hostile  It means a lot these days   Dude  absolutely  Sometimes I try to point out people's needless hostility to them  because something about the internet just causes it  It's not even the anonymity  because people are even monsters on Facebook where you can see their full name  where they live  the last 7 meals they ate  and what kind of spider scares them the most  I think if people could commit to being just 10  nicer online  a nice small number to start with   the world would feel so much safer   But yeah  I don't know if this is stereotypical of white people or not  but I kind of obsess talking about all this stuff  and love the opportunity to do it with people who aren't me  and are also into it  It sounds to me that you are an introvert    it is totally fine to not like hanging out in big groups and preferring it to be more private  it's only a problem when it makes you anxious thinking of or interacting with strangers How long did it take for you to start feeling the zoloft taking effect and what changed  just curious as i just started taking it and have done for almost 2 weeks now When I try to shrug it off and laugh  people can see I am bothered by it  Being criticised gives me a feeling I have had and remember from grade school when I got it pretty bad  It's a visceral reaction that people notice  I know a need a new view and out look on life  I just don't know what that is   I new way to think about things  Like  not thinking about anything except what is going on in that moment  etc  Actually showing interest in what people say  Only showing my real emotions  But when I say goodbye etc people are smiling  but if I smile it's so obviously fake  I've seen myself in the reflection and in pictures  people can tell   Thanks so much for listening and your advice  I will use it  X Post referenced from   r socialskills  http   np reddit com r socialskills  by  u Ruigaard    How to stop being socially limited  http   np reddit com r socialskills

fact that you're even able to keep it together most of the time   let alone attend college   is incredible  Were I in your shoes  I don't even know if I could survive a day    Check with your college's disability office to see if to see if they can help you out  As for your boyfriend  I can't really give more advice without knowing what kind of problem you two are experiencing  Maybe give him some time to cool off and talk to him again   What do you mean by too forward  X Thanks for the help  What about the eye thing though  Honestly I think I just let my eyes wander  its just kind of awkward we got a connection from that    And the weed thing feeling love in my heart    Am I trying to think too much into this  2016 actually went by so slowly for me despite finishing my first year of college  transferring to a new college and city and going on vacation twice  It was a looooong year  but I still know what you mean  I went past my old school today and I felt sad and it's so strange because I live on the same road as my school and saw it a million times since leaving and didn't feel anything  but anxiety makes me feel like ughhhhh when I see it  And yeah my sleeping pattern is godawful I went to bed at 5 30 this morning  Given that he went home before he started v  he might be the kind that would rather tough it out by himself  My bf had a really bad bout of noro and I called asking if I could do anything for him  i e  drop off some pepto bismol or gatorade or something   and he was in so much agony that he just wanted to be left alone  He was also embarrassed I think and didn't want me to see him like that at that point in our relationship  we'd only been together a few months   Maybe you can offer to drop by with supplies and see what he says  He may not feel up to it and you'll be off the hook    Update  I'm giving the same medication another try right now  I heard from my psychiatrist that I can expect to feel sick for a week or two and then see positive results  I don't know if I'll be able to stick to it  but I'm trying again  i'm female This is excellent advice   Generally the police contacting the individual is enough to make them stop   But don't take this lightly   Your safety and life depend on it  Yeah  you're being irrational  but hopefully I can help talk you down  Restaurants  especially reputable ones like how you mention this one is  have very stringent requirements about workers not coming to work in the kitchen when they are ill  That's why things like the outbreak at Chipotle don't happen more often  the businesses would be liable if one of their employees knowingly spread noro around to a bunch of customers    Try to distract yourself from the anxiety this is causing you by doing something enjoyable  i e reading  watching tv  listening to music  taking a walk   Sounds like a misunderstanding  Perhaps you took it too personally   I don't know if this is stereotypical of white people or not  but I kind of obsess talking about all this stuff  and love the opportunity to do it with people who aren't me  and are also into it   Nah  this is counter to the stereotype that talking about race makes White people uncomfortable  You're doing a good thing by being open to discussing issues of injustice and listening to marginalized people  Please keep seeking out these opportunities  but also make sure to keep your mental health in mind  this is  r Anxiety after all    I took it in high school to deal with anxiety issues  It actually helped a lot back then  it was easier to focus on work and make friends  etc      My boyfriend and I started to grow apart though  because it kind of made me "emotionless"  The way it worked for me is that anything negative that would come to mind just wouldn't stick long enough to upset me      But it made it easier to not care about some things I should have cared more about  I stopped taking it for awhile and when I started again it was after having eating disorder induced anxiety  It made the anxiety worse     I don't know your situation or reason for taking it but those are my experiences with it  There can be negatives to taking it or positives depending on what type of anxiety you're having      As far as the side effects go  I would just watch out for personality changes  weight loss  or psychological effects if you miss or take more than prescribed  Those are the only ones I experienced     Anxiety isn't rational  if you're stressed performing high pressure procedures that is rational  Anxiety stems from irrational thought biases that we have  I find this video explains it really well  https   www youtube com watch v sA0qcELeGl8 t 8s Hey I want to say to you a huge CONGRATS  You have a fear that has controlled your life  you lived your own true worst nightmare and look at you    you SURVIVED  You are FINE  No lasting problems  you are no longer sick and you only got sick because YOU made the choice to have a fun night and drink  Nothing out of your control  You weren't dealing with something awful like food poisoning or a virus  You were partying  And you puked  And then you felt better  And you never have to puke that way again if you don't want to  It may seem scary to imagine it happening now because you're imagining doing it sober but don't worry  I promise you you won't drunkelny puke if you're sober     From one emetophobic to another  I'm proud of you for going through it like a champ  Now treat yourself to something good  you deserve it   This one looks free  http   azcoloring com hard dot to dots Out of curiosity  did you notice yourself getting distant  Reading my own story here   What bothers me now i feel tired and low energy  From day to day  Googling about cancers and deadly diseases   Fuck this shit   I have dealt with this issue  so you are not alone   I spent a long time being told it was stress based asthma and was given a rescue inhaler albuterol  for it after taking chest x rays and doing some breathing tests   This was the worst thing that could have happened because it made everything worse   what the actual problem is is hard to say  but I did black out a couple times because of it   I dealt with this issue for probably 2 years in which my stress levels peaked quite a bit  then it subsided after I made some life changes   It did come back during some serious stress in my life and still does from time to time   What has helped me   Its hard to say   After being put on a variety of different medications  it eventually subsided to only having the issue about once a month   I was also seeing a therapist during this time and it may have helped   I remember the neural feedback that he did with me helped my breathing quite a bit   Everyone's body is different  so it could just be stress building up inside of you   Wish I could be of more assistance  but again  its not just you  I think it took about 1 month  It's one of those things that if you have severe OCD for instance  about 1 2 months later you realise like 99  of your old is gone  Give it time  I don't recall the exact time it took but it was anywhere from 1 2 5 months for it to fully take effect   Take care    Hi  Fellow POCD sufferer here   I know the feeling  You don't feel like you're worth anything because of your OCD  and you feel like you want to scream it to the world so they "know what you are "  I've been there  and it's all part of the process  I think it's called an urge to confess   confess that you have these feelings that you can't pinpoint and it makes you horrible   But it doesn't  I hope I'm not on the reassurance line here  because that is actually not helping the coping process   Acceptance is a huge part of getting over your fear of going outside  and accepting the thoughts is hard  I know  because who would want to accept these thoughts      and you need to work with yourself and  if you have a therapist  that person  to get outside of your comfort zone and begin moving around again   Look at me  I've had it for close to three years now  diagnosed  and now I'm able to help with children again  I still have the thoughts  but the point is I am able to work past them and just realize that they are thoughts  Hi  I've replied to you before and I have to ask if you have sought professional help   The reason I'm asking is this is apparently really affecting your quality of life  If you don't have a therapist  I would highly suggest seeking one out  I am on a low income program through our local mental health center  and that is an option  Usually your state has one  25 and divorced here  too  I was about to write the same comment  What an inspiration  I'm currently looking at flights and things to do in neighboring states    to go by mself  How terrifying and exciting all at once  Can your bf be let to know that it might be better to save those questions for another time   If you're already feeling anxious it probably doesn't help to be made to consider this stuff     It might be helpful to do some of the anxiety calming techniques  if your therapist has mentioned any   like tapping  or yoga  or controlled breathing   Also  you might reassure yourself  I am safe now   I am in a better place now   It is okay to be afraid  but we are in a safer place than we were  My ex was the same whenever he got drunk  to the point I would avoid him if he had alcohol in his system   I'm really sorry that happened to you  I don't know your relationship  but mine only got worse from there   This blog has some really awesome resources for social anxiety  Hope it helps    http   blog tranqool com  s social anxiety utm medium Reddit utm source reddit utm term social anxiety Past sexual traumas can definitely impact future relationships  I think it would be helpful to go to RAINN org they have resources on there and if you go to their chat line  the counselors can send you links to further reading on how to address the struggles you are facing now  I'm sorry about what happened to you  but eventually with time and effort you should be able to cope with what happened and have it affect you less  Oh hey  are you me   I was on Paxil and soon after the anxiety went away  I was still somewhat anxious in hard social situations or when travelling  but everyday anxiety was manageable   I am not off it for a few months in order to try on my own  plus the sexual side effects were crap   Nope  can't do it  The anxiety came back  and I can't even manage it with 0 5mgx2 of Xanax a day  started with 0 25mgx2   My stomach is killing me in the morning  and I feel the need to puke  I eat way less  I am very uncomfortable in social situations  and only alcohol helps  which is not something I want to do   Going to see my doctor on Friday  If anyone has anything to recommend  I'm listening  Yeah   I've said that  I told him it's making me super anxious  I'm trying to put it out of my mind until I speak to my therapist   I have heard of tapping  and tried it  but it doesn't seem to work  Neither does breathing  However  I haven't tried yoga   Thank you  friend  This helps a lot  In 2011  I was working on a ranch  I was in high school  I was an avid athlete  and sports were my life  It was the end of the school year  and open gym was about to start  my favorite time of the year  because open gym meant we could play co ed  make our own teams  and play whatever games we wanted  basically I got to win every time    I went out on the ranch  made a pile of cactus and brush I had pulled out of a fence line  and lit it on fire  In the process  I gave myself second degree burns to my right arm and face  I was alone  I was hurt  I had to get to a hospital  As I started to heal  I would lay in pain on the couch  with my parents constantly checking on me  Crying in the shower  I would have to scrub my healing skin until it bled  so as to be sure there was a blood supply to my infantile skin  As I was crying one day  my father came in the bathroom and sat on the toilet by the bathtub  He gave me the single best piece of advice I've ever received  "Give in to the pain  Stop fighting it  You won't win  Pain is an error window on the computer  and in order to get rid of it  you can "X" out and it will come back again  or you can click "OK" and acknowledge that it's there " After returning to school  I didn't think about life or death anymore  just the next girl  the next game  the next party    Fast forward to the August after my high school graduation  and I am getting a job in the oil fields of South Texas  Best decision I ever made  I worked my way up to a position in which I would drive  alone  to locations sometimes two hours away from our main office where I reported to work  About a month into it  I remember a specific trip  I was driving to a location 2 1 2 hours away and I couldn't see any other cars and I thought  "If I died while driving  no one would find me " I hearkened back to the words of my father when he worked at a job that had him isolated for long periods of time  "There is not time like alone time  It teaches you more about yourself that anyone else will ever know " Usually I remember my father's words with comfort  but this day  I remembered them  and they fell into the pit that was an overwhelming cacophony of the noise of my thoughts  I started going numb and shut down  I pulled over and sat on the side of the road until I relaxed and thought  "What was that "  I began having these fits often  and would call people to keep my mind off of it  but lo and behold  as soon as my phone screen read "NO SERVICE" I was falling in a hole of despair  One day while I was driving  I began to have a panic attack and remembered my dad's advice about pain  I gave in to the panic  I rode it like a wave and thought about the causes and effects of what I was thinking  "I'm having a heart attack "  you're not having a heart attack  You're 18 and healthy  How could you possibly have a heart attack  "I have a brain tumor "  so what if you have a brain tumor  you're fine right now   "No one will find me if I die "  everyone dies  and if you die  you're dead  What do you care what comes after   and thus began my path to less anxiety    The big lesson overall is that we all die  We all have fear of death  At times  fear of death is paralyzing and panic inducing and brings the strongest of heart to their knees  One of my favorite quotes is from Mel Gibson's character in  Gladiator    "Death smiles at us all  All a man can do is smile back " So do just that  Smile back  Fight that bastard  Tell him  "I'm not going down without a fight " Death in inevitable  but life isn't  So instead of worrying about the death that comes for us all  we have an obligation to worry about the possibility of not having lived  I  personally  try to make an impact on everyone's life who I meet  If death comes for your body  it comes  But it can't extinguish the flame of your life    TLDR  Don't take life too seriously  no one gets out alive     what i've found helps me is doing puzzles  You can break it up and take as much time as you need  But  when you are feeling anxious at home  just sit down and focus on a task  By the time i'm done i'm no longer feeling anxious and it's mentally exhausting so it does help burn excess energy a bit   Okay   It wasn't important I just wanted to let you know how little I could tell about who you are  Better to have called and it be nothing  then to not have called and it have been something worse  Good job  OP  When you first start talking about it or getting therapy for it  it won't be easy dealing with what happened  You may hit low points but ultimately addressing it  will lead you on a path of recovery  It has been nearly a year for me since I finally admitted to myself that I was sexually abused and only now can I cope with what happened  I wish you the best of luck  I force myself to be in social situations quite often  not to mention my job  But it never goes away  in fact lately it's very strong  I can barely look at people sometimes  because when I do they can see something is wrong   Thank you I want to be a guy who you can look in the eyes and just feel comfortable  My personal anxiety tool is a little bead string that I made for myself with different shaped beads on it   When I get upset  I sit with it and press on the beads and count them  so I don't get all caught up in my head    Hi  Yes I am going to a therapist for Cbt   All I've had is my introductory session as of now  And my next proper session is on 5th  with in that time it's getting worse for me but just for this segment alone  being something I wanted to put it out there and ask for some pointers so I don't end being like this for months until my therapist fixes me  Hoping she does   That sounds like it could work for me  as I dissociate a lot  I get caught up in there a looooot  Im not sure this is the correct forum for your post  You admit that you didn't study enough  You admit that laziness is a factor  Most people that are high achievers  like your friend  prefer to be surrounded by like minded people  Don't take it personally  I'm not sure what your question is but does it have to do anything with social anxiety  serious question     I read somewhere recently that the only way to find something  real  with someone is to genuinely be yourself  I have anxiety too  and it's difficult to imagine anyone else really knowing what we go through on a daily basis      Whether it's obsessing over the smallest things  or feeling hopeless suicidal some days  or feeling like we're just not "normal" enough for most people      Be yourself  There are so many people out there  just like you  Express what you like and like to do  And if you're nervous and think you're going to say the wrong thing  don't get ahead of yourself     Don't go about it as if you're going to mess things up  or you're not saying the right thing  Say what expresses  you  the most      If they're right for you  they'll like you for the person you are and accept any problem you might have  I think the best way to have a relationship you're really comfortable in too  is to be friends with someone first  It's a lot easier to start things out that way when you're not sure how to immediately go about dating    Take a look at Bren Browns 2 TED talks  I come from a similar experience and found her talks incredibly insightful   From my experience  poor self esteem isn't about my relationships with others but about my relationship with myself  The abuse I received as a child has been internalized and I have been abusing myself all these years  Fortunately making up with myself is more possible than making amends with family   Hi there  Let me start with this  the great thing about college is that you don't have to go into it knowing what you want to do  Hell  even people who think they know end up changing their minds once or twice  It happened to me  and I thought I had it all figured out  The important thing is to try different classes and see what makes you excited and hungry to learn more  But that's a little bit into the future   let's talk about the present    Right now  it sounds like you may be depressed  I've learned that enough anxiety can do that to you  They go hand in hand  unfortunately   It sounds like you want to learn skills like cooking and building   but lack of motivation  possibly from depression  is keeping you from doing so    My suggestion would be to find a way to tackle this lack of motivation  Start exercising a little every day if you can  see a doctor about depression if you can  Learn to meditate  See a counselor  at school or a private one  to learn how to gain confidence and practice social skills    I have tried these things myself  and they have helped me  I'm not "cured" of my anxiety by any means  but I am in better control of it than I used to be  I wish you luck  Thank you for this   it was touching and really gives me a lot to think about and work on  I will refer back to your words when I'm getting lost in those thoughts  Means a lot  thanks   I was thinking the anxiety of worrying about what he thinks  It can make me feel anxious around him because i never know when he's thinking ill of me   However  I suppose you're right that I know what this is about  I can't force someone to like me if I'm not respectable as a person but it sucks because i don't view myself as someone who isn't well meaning and it depresses me that it matters so much how well I study in regards with who wants to talk to me  I understand it  but it makes me sad  Well  on that one  I don't know      Only you can tell whether it was just a passing thing or indicative of real feelings for your friend  And only you can tell what you'd like to do with those feelings if you do have them  Good luck  Just threaten you'll report him for harassment  Most guys don't want to pursue after that  There are times i feel completely worthless  i totally get that feeling   Albeit for different reasons   I really think the PTSD exacerbates the issues   It feels like everything i do  nothing is right   I have made some really awful comments to my SO about how she needed to just leave  about how it's really what she wants to do   My photos  they almost always end up in garbage because i hate how they look   So after so long  i just gave up and became so complacent that she really did want to leave   Of course this didn't help the depression   But  let it be known  you have nothing to feel guilty about   Tell this to yourself everyday if you have to   Easier said then done  i know  you'll get there   Another thing  focus on yourself   Take at least an hour each day  just you  and do what you like   Read a book  take pictures  paint  get a massage  whatever  but it's just you   Then  take the smallest problem you have and work on it  till you overcome it   For me  i have personal space issues  so getting a massage was a huge deal   So i worked on it until i did it   But do it for yourself  you are the only one you need to impress right now  everyone is secondary or just plain vapor  Ah  that makes sense  Perhaps you could practice working on your confidence privately  I have spent several years working on changing the way I talk to myself think about myself and my life  I remind myself that I matter as much as anyone else  that everyone makes mistakes  that I do a good job with things  and that my feelings matter  And when I don't hate myself  it makes it easier to be confident interacting with others  I don't know if that helps  I hope this gets easier for you  Good luck  Good luck with the testing  I hope both of us find the right medication  Practice  Based on your post it looks like you spend too much time on little details that may or may not be true  It's almost like you have to invent something negative to dwell on  Or if you hear a positive story  you will find the one minor negative part of it and focus on that  Stop doing that  If someone throws one dagger at you  you end up throwing 100 many more at yourself and beat yourself up way more than you should  It's not an attractive quality and you don't want to be a downer  Why don't you focus on the positive and not try to twist her words around into something negative  Just think for once maybe someone means what they say   Sometimes  only because it was easier to ignore some of the things around me I should have been worried about  If I got in trouble over something it wasn't a big deal  if one of my friends or family members was having a problem it was easier to not worry about it as much  where normally it would affect me just as much  That kind of thing   I understand that the dynamic is different in a society where men are expected to make the first move and face a lot more rejection than women  I do get it  at least a little  though  I'm get really intense about people quickly and I've been massively insecure  and both of those things have scared people off    Things can get better  though  Learning to be okay with myself has both made me less off putting to other people and more okay with the times when things just don't work out    Just because you haven't found a right person yet doesn't mean you never will  Good luck  Everything you mentioned is easily within your control  Just study harder and be less lazy  It will pay off in the end  It's okay if he doesn't want to be your friend  Some people are like this  I would focus on improving your grades  Do it for you  though   Okay  generally what the medication should be doing   I ask because a lot of my anxiety revolves around my relationship  And I'm a bit afraid of a medication causing problems in it  Though I'm so over the top now  if it were to do that to me  it might be good  So it feels kinda like "This could be exactly what you need  or it could ruin you "  In any case  That was really helpful feedback  thank you  Forward with my emotions and feelings  usually a bit too soon  I know that scares girls off   I       should have been a lot more careful  that's for sure  I was lucky that my lack of caution didn't land me an infection    That's a hard place to be  I've been there  too  And it's good that you know what you need and don't put yourself around people who would make you feel bad  You'll find someone who's good to you       The thought of that honestly sounds disgusting  Thinking rationally about all this  I think I'm over obsessing Well   kissing is overrated   But if it makes you feel any better   I'm 25 and have never had a relationship   You just have to talk  Easier said then done  I've been there before  One thing I learned is that people are more sympathetic then you think  I started being up and honest about my anxiety to people if they ever wondered why I was so anxious  Idk if it hurt or helped my social relationships but it sure helped me break my bubble of VERY terrible social anxiety  Now I only have it a little and is manageable  There are more than one thing you should do  think positive  believe in yourself  have a good posture  go out more and practice things that make you "not confidence"  Yes  she doesn't need to know this upfront  You need to get to know people more before talking about past relationships  I would also do some digging to find out why your previous relationships failed  Also I think this should have been posted in a relationship forum  And stop meeting people off of Craigslist  Hey  you stood up to him that's definitely something to be proud of  It's still an awful situation and it was still super shitty of him to do that to you  but you should give yourself a ton of credit for not allowing him to continue taking advantage of you  I'm proud of you     If most of your anxiety is relationship related  it should help a lot  Anytime my bf and I would argue it didn't last very long or affect me throughout the day  It generally just makes you a chiller person if you have a lot going on everyday      Hope it works well for you   Yeah  you're right  Honestly  sometimes I wonder how much I care about what I study  but at the end of the day I can't think of a field I would be more interested in than what i do right now and I really do owe it to myself to pull through with it  Sometimes I do admittedly fall into a trap of doing something with my life choices dependant of what others might think    too much in fact  You will always be  1  People come and go but you gotta focus on you  You don't want to pick a field to impress others only to be miserable for the rest of your career  You are so lucky to get a second chance on the test so really try and pass that  It will pay off in the future  Good luck   You're welcome  To overcome caring about what other people think and having people like you  you just need to be comfortable and accepting of yourself  and surround yourself with people who feel this way about you too  Get to know yourself  your hobbies  your opinions  your role models  your goals  your beliefs  your flaws and your good traits  Get to know people who think like you and like what you like or even just share the same sense of humour   I'm confident in my personality but I still have some insecurities about my appearance  I often think I could lose a bit of weight or maybe wear make up more often  Then I think but who would that be for  Not myself cos I don't mind my looks  I'm not a model  I'm just normal  My boyfriend loves me  so do my friends and family  So I'd literally be making changes to myself for the sake of a strangers own voice in their own head  I go to uni every day with no makeup on  and I can see all the barbie dolls looking at me like I have two heads  I just look back at them daring them to say what they'll whisper to each other when I'm out of earshot and they never do  I think they're just jealous because they aren't comfortable enough in their own skin to show their natural faces   You're lucky to have someone who's understanding about your anxiety  I've never had that  not even once  Not a friend  not a girlfriend  nobody except my therapist but he's a professional   not someone I can rely on to be there for me as a friend or anything  The glistens thing I've had was a girlfriend who didn't quite understand  but she was accommodating  But she left me because I become inconvenient in her life  I've come to the conclusion that my life would be a lot better if I could find someone who's comforting during these moments  and I'm on an endless search for that person  Sometimes I feel like I'll always feel lonely  that I'll never have a deep connection with someone else  Most of the time I feel hopeless    Edit  once a week is great if you ask me   Thanks    it's always reassuring to hear that MERICA  After 8 years with OCD the guilt pretty much disappeared  but a new feeling came in  I feel think that I am a worthless human being  spineless  That I shouldn't even get born  Wait  isn't that guilt  It's just that I don't feel terrified about intrusive thoughts  Please take this advice and accept it  Anxiety is a mental disorder  a year ago I wouldn't give you this advice  You need medication  I finally cave in and similar situation like you  Talked to my doctor and she prescribed me xanax and has helped me with those meetings  No refills  so you don't abuse it  It works   I took it once for anxiety while flying  It took about an hour or two to reach full potency and lasted at least 12 hours   I felt a bit loopy but mostly apathetic  I don't think my fear of flying was reduced so much as I cared less about being afraid   In that sense it broke the feedback loop to which I would fall prey   FYI  the labels aren't kidding  DO NOT have any amount of alcohol if you've taken this  I had a single beer 12  hours after taking it and blacked out within 20 minutes  not intentional  just stupid   Now that you put it that way  it doesn't seem as bad  This helped me feel a lot better about the situation  thank you  Start by really immersing yourself in something or things you are good at  Whatever that is  Cooking  making music  art  science  whatever  And always praise your own results  Then try one new thing that you think you'll be good at  and you'll be surprised how quickly your confidence grows   Confidence comes from being accepting and knowledgeable about yourself  You can't be confident when you don't like yourself or are imitating other people to create some kind of identity  Don't care what other people think  Their thoughts are just a tiny little voice in their own head that you can't hear  so they might as well be thinking nothing  By thinking they are thinking bad of you  you are thinking for them putting words in their head that aren't there  and chances are  you're way off base   Confidence doesn't come naturally to some people  myself included  it takes time and work and motivation to step a little outside your comfort zone  Thinking you can't do something is the exact reason why you should try and do it  Failures happen  accept some things are just not for you and learn from it   Example  didn't think I would ever get a good education  I am now halfway through my law degree   Failed at zumba classes  Terribly  Everyone was in perfect synchronised dancing harmony and there was me sweating like a pig and flailing around like a crazy woman  Totally humiliating  Will never go again  Note to self   group weight loss activities are not for me  Take up swimming  I love water lol   Alcohol and marijuana  I stopped taking Ativan after about a year and a half  every day every other day  small amounts  last August  since then I've taken it twice  That sucks  Go to another pharmacy  lol we're all to anxious to join  I'm the same way  and my nurse says it's common  You're describing what sounds like 'white coat hypertension'  I have the same problem   it's where your blood pressure rises due to anxiety being in the presence of a doctor or nurse a healthcare environment or if you're thinking about it too much  and increased heart rate will raise blood pressure  As long as your blood pressure is 140 90 or below after you start to relax  you can be assured that you don't have any issues with your blood pressure  it's just you being anxious  I have to tell whoever does my blood pressure that I have white coat hypertension  It's not embarrassing  it's very common  Try and take deep  slow breaths      Since then I have spoken with the police  and they have stated that they are aware of the situation and referred me to a victims advocate  Not much help there  The hard part is walking away from everything  My home  my dogs  all my belongings  It's just a really messed up situation     u lmt0311  Im very glad you are getting out of the situation  Im so very sorry for what you have been through  I do recommend checking with the victims advocate to see if there are free therapy sessions available  It can be a big help  Im sorry you dont feel supported  I do understand that the cops can unfairly target the male when the female party is the abuser  However  it does sound to me that they believe you here  I dont know if that helps  Ultimately  the only person that can get you moving forward is you  I dont see if you are married  How about the apartment  Do you rent  Are you on the lease agreement  If so  it may be necessary for you to ask for a restraining order against her  She isnt going to stop the back and forth  And the order may help with the landlord letting you out of the lease    Taking the steps to leave is the beginning  You have done that  Now it takes one step at a time to move forward  Keep your eye on the ball  Be kind to yourself  Sleep well  rest  exercise  eat well   Find a place to live  And block her in all forms  the texts  calls  email  etc  Please actively block her  That allows you to rest and not be anxious over her next contact with you at her will    Please also take a look at the resources in our sidebar  They are out there  Please reach out and take a look  You have done the hardest part  which is to leave  Now you need to stay gone and move forward in a healthy manner  One step at a time  OP  You can do this  It can be a challenge  But we all gotta be here for one another  The inspiration is key     feel free to message me if you ever wanna talk   Once I had the beer the effect of the alcohol just felt amplified  I felt extremely drunk  without any kind of sick or full feeling from the over consumption typically required for this  and have no memory of the ride home nor of going to bed    If you are curious about the medication alone  it's a high without euphoria if that makes any sense  I've had very similar experiences for the past 6 months  What was thought to be lymes was actually Mononucleosis  I had some severe physical and mental side effects that are similar to what Lyme's people get   The mental is the scariest  A lot of my reading is that the mental side effects is due to over inflamation of the body due to the immune system trying to fight the infection  Both mono  which is EBV  and Lyme's are a medium term illness that takes time clean up   I had everything you describe and then some  The best advice I can give is eat well  eat antifungal and anti inflammatory foods  drink lots of water and exercise  By exercise I mean just small walks here and there  Also  real coconut oil has some serious health benefits  Major studies show it's simply amazing stuff   My wife takes buspirone for anxiety  She tried others and they all make her loopy as well  This seems to actually work and she loves it  It's very easy on you  The first 45 mins after taking she is dizzy  I'd recommend this    Good luck and be patient  This too shall pass    Oh don't get me wrong buddy  my boyfriend isn't understanding  He used to tell me not to worry all the time but now just accepts the fact that I will anyway  He is calming in the sense that he is a calm  laid back person by nature and it rubs off on me in the way that being in a hospital when you're ill makes you feel safer even though you've been given no treatment yet    I drive him mad with my bouts of insecurities about the relationship  I can be very needy and clingy and constantly asking him to reassure me that he isn't going to break up with me  I over think absolutely everything  and see all the grey areas   Whereas he is logical and sees things very black and white   But  I'm almost 33 years old  I've had one marriage and a fair few long term relationships since I was 16  but I think this guy is my first proper love  It is unconditional from both of us  That's what you need to find  not nessecarily someone who will understand your anxiety  but someone who just accepts you for who you are and won't try and change you    I refuse to let my anxiety be the focal point of anything in my life  In my relationship  we make sure we focus on what we have in common and just deal with my anxiety like a cold  Embrace it when it comes  work through it and push back to normality  It's not easy at all and has nearly broke us up more than once  But it's not getting to take away the only thing that keeps me sane these days   Eta  thank you for pointing out the once a week thing  Cos if I had my way I'd see him every day  This is overwhelming for him as he loves indulging in his hobbies and keeping up his relationships outside of ours  Friends and family for example  I know I'm being irrational  that's anxiety for you  and it's nice to hear other people say we're doing just fine at once a week   It's reassuring   Your ex sounds like a bit of a selfish shit if you ask me  which has nothing to do with you or your anxiety  She just isn't made of strong stuff to handle people like us lol but you will find someone who is  Just don't stop trying xx Go somewhere else  They come a dime a dozen  I do these hourly checkins with myself using a scale 110  Based on events in my life from very happy safe to terrified  This helps me know if I am headed towards an episode which could last days  And can pull out if it before it is too late when using this method  I have been using this method for 6 months and to my knowledge  have clear  I also wearing an earring that I associate with my gf  I have a clinical dx of PTSD   Aspergers I was fortunate enough to get several years off the pills but I feel your pain  I got myself to the doctor today and got a prescription of celexa and feeling so much more hopeful  I was really downtrodden there  I hope you find a solution  xanax and alcohol definitely aren't manageable for non stop bouts of this anxiety  Best of luck   I ate raw chicken  in the center  and never got sick  I did it more than once  You'll be fine  I understand that you are nervous and it's okay to be nervous before a first date  I was in the same seat about 2 months ago so I feel your pain  For me personally my stomach hurt on the way to the date because I was so nervous  but once I met her and we started talking it wasn't that bad  The build up is the worst part  the actual date is not that bad    If it makes you feel better he is probably at home right now thinking the same things as you for example "should I offer to pay "  Also remember that he  wants  to meet you  take that as a positive thing and let it make you excited   As far as paying and what not it's pretty easy in your situation since I'm assuming that he asked you out and that you are a girl  If he offers to pay and you want him to pay then let him pay  If he doesn't offer to pay  pay for your own stuff  If he goes in for the kiss then do what you feel is right  If you want to kiss then do it  if you don't tell him you aren't ready   Good luck I'm rooting for you    Let's see  I hate touching anything in a public restroom  gas pumps  my shoes  certain door handles  anything that's been on the floor ground  gas cap on my car  garbage cans and bags  I'm sure there's some I'm missing  I also have to wash my hands before I use the bathroom  as I'm afraid of transmitting herpes HIV to myself from touching an object  Thanks for the replies  I'm relieved to see that it's common  My doctor seemed very surprised when i told him and he said that it could only raise a tiny bit  well  the thing is  i used chicken that were one day past the 'sell by' date in the package  just plain thin chicken cutlets for chicken parm  when i opened them  they didnt smell or look slimy   a couple other people i asked said i should be fine too  but this lovely emeto brain is like 'but lets not NOT freak out just yet' Just delete it  I don't have Facebook  Haven't had it in years  I can tell you speaking from experience it's certainly not "weird" to not have it  Be proud your not addicted to something so superficial anyway   I don't have any off the top of my head tips for how to reduce this   But if you sweat a ton from your underarms  get Certain Dri  the roll on   You only apply it at night  and not very frequently  but really can help if you excessively sweat to the point you're embarrassed by it  Should be fine  Sell by and use by are different dates   You've basically described my whole life  I even ended up in a hospital  because my GP measured my blood pressure during the check up and it was so bad she told me to go straight to the hospital  Few hours later  after ECG and several blood tests  everything came out clear and I went back home  Don't worry about this too much  Perhaps you could work a bit on your anxiety and try some calming techniques  You could buy blood pressure measuring device and try checking it at home yourself as a form of desensitization   there wasnt a use by date on the package  just sell by  I would say there's more than likely a few things going on with Chuck  but I do believe there is a basis of OCD behavior  especially how he gets sick from things  has these compulsive behaviors to prevent the bad things from happening etc    obviously as is with anything  there is embelishment  But so far it's been an interesting interpretation  Ohhhh  I totally get where you're coming from  and I can imagine a sales career would be especially difficult when you're suffering from clinical anxiety   I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder  And while my anxiety can be triggered by a variety of things  my professional life has proven to be the most common and significant trigger  It's such a theme over the course of my adult life    I believe it comes back to associating my self worth with my work performance  and the opinions of my co workers  The later of which I truly can't control    My therapist has recommended scheduling "off" time  which sounds intuitive but is incredibly difficult  Don't check email when you're home or on the weekends  And make it a point to try  so much easier said than done  to avoid work thoughts while at home    She's told me visualize a stop sign when I begin to experience cognitive distortions  like black and white thinking  She's also suggested reframing things into an "annoying" category  ie  this person who keeps emailing me less than pleasant things is just an annoyance  not a threat to my self worth    One of her other suggestions was to "schedule" my worry time  So  maybe Sundays from 2 to 3 are when I'm going to sit around and consider all the bad things that are about to happen     The rest of the week  it's just not the time for it    Recognizing when a thought is a cognitive distortion has been the most helpful  I can kind of say  'OK  that's the anxiety talking '  All this is so much easier said than done  I think anyone reading this sub gets that   I'm in my 30s and they've been my pharmacy since I was born  it feels really annoying to have to change now    It's a new Pharmacist too  the rest are fine     Thanks  Although I actively worked on it for years  there were times when I thought of giving up entirely   Going to a dentist used to be very traumatic experience say about 7 years ago  I'm never afraid of my teeth pulled out but the small talk I had to surely make  This is where I started  But didn't want it to define my future  Recovery started when I found out there were others that are going through the same thing  and that it has a name   I'm happy because right now  I am travelling and using AirBnB and hostels  not for financial reasons but just to cement my recovery  and just thinking about how else I can improve my life   The everyday flashes of SA are far fewer and don't last that long  they are very good reminders on how far I have come  I think this is something I wanna do  Brilliant idea    probably an app in there somewhere too    Honestly  I think you did everything fine  I'm in the same boat at 24 and I was in a  somewhat  similar situation   I was talking with some coworkers  one being my crush  and at one point the conversation turned into past relationships  when the attention was on me I flat out said I've never had a girlfriend before  They gave me weird looks and my crush re blurted my statement  "you've never had a girlfriend  "  I was just being honest and in situations like this it really makes me proud of my best quality  and maybe a month or two later we went out  Not really a date so much but we both had fun   Of course I would maybe wait or never bring it up if you don't have want to  but you were sort of pinned into an answer  In short I believe honesty is one of the best traits you can have  and really claiming it to be who you are is a great feeling  Just know what meds don't have any crazy side effects  They can make the anxiety worse for the first 4 6 weeks but the overall effects are less worse than the crippling anxiety  I would suggest giving it a try  I'm on Zoloft  75mg and I'm kinda in the middle of figuring out the right dosage and brand   It's a possibility  but it sounds like you just might be asexual  I'm a little confused by this thread  did a part of it get deleted  Judging by the context of the comments  it sounds like you ate raw chicken that was a day past the sell by  So  it's worth noting that sell by is bumped up by a lot of days because the manufacturer would rather play it safe and not risk lawsuits from people dabbling too close to the sell by  I'd say most items have at least four to six days past their sell by  raw meats  anyway    I've also seen a lot of people eat chicken that was still pink in the center and didn't get sick  but I wouldn't do it every day  It's definitely a game of Russian Roulette  you know   You'll probably be fine  But to answer the question  it really depends on the type of bacteria you've ingested  I've had foods that sickened me as short as within 4 hours of eating and I've had foods that sickened me about a day and a half later  at least  if I'm sure that I know what it was that made me sick  sometimes we just never really know  I've only had it a handful of times in my life though  so I mean  it really doesn't happen as often as our emeto brain makes us think  It's easier each time  too  Kind of like childbirth  Hell yeh man  That shit can last forever  and barely go away with meds if it's rough enough  I just started taking nexium again I feel great until I wake up  I usually take it at 6 before dinner and by the time I'm up at 6 I'm feelin pretty shitty again  And it's a 24 hour drug too    Also your heart probably ain't racing  Or picks up after you think of it  It can also make your esophagus flutter right at the connection between stomach and throat  Or so I have been told by my GI doctor  Which is scary as shit cause you insta think it's heart then freak out    But if you want man  Do you have a Patient First near you  We have them outside Philadelphia  They can do a walk in ekg  That will show if you have a serious issue or not  And doctors can hear bad heart signs just by listening with a stethescope  I like to think doctors are twats most the time  But I realize more and more how they actually know a lot more then what I've learned thru dr  House and web md    But if you need it  Get an ekg and have them print the results for you  And keep them on you or posted some where you see daily  Just keep showing it to yourself    I have had acid reflux since October 4th 2010 tho bro  I keep a food journal and I try to combat my bad foods as much as possible  But you can't live without pizza it's impossible    One love   Sorry you are going through this  You didn't do anything to deserve this unprofessional treatment  This pharmacist has taken it on himself to overrule an order from your doctor  e g  the new prescription    I also encourage you to go somewhere else  Loyalty and emotional connection to a small business is great  but you deserve to be treated with dignity and respect  The pharmacist's behavior here is unethical on several levels   Usually I think it's within 48 hours of the sell by date with chicken  With milk I think you get a week after the sell by  If it said use by yesterday  it still probably wouldn't have been a big deal  If it smelled ok and you cooked it to temp  you're A OK  D I understand  Your only options is to confront  complain  or change  No matter how bad times have gotten for me I always come out of the stress and anxiety even for a little bit and that reminds me of what life is like without anxiety  I can't say that our situation is the same but I think we all have a little bit of hope of what life could hold for us without this thing  I know for me it may take a long time  maybe years before I'm free but its taking it one step at a time  Life is worth living   I'm positive about my relationship  Mostly  He can't handle it when it's at its worst  The worst it's ever been is once I texted him and told him I was gonna kill myself  He didn't message me for three days cos he needed space to think  I spent the first night in hospital and the next two days going out of my mind with worry about him  Not only did he let me down at my worst time  he made it worse by abandoning me for days afterwards   If there's one thing you don't do to someone with anxiety is give them the silent treatment and leave them alone with their own thoughts   It took me weeks to forgive him for that and he was sincerely apologetic  I've only had an episode like that once and never since  hopefully I won't again  Everything else in my life I'm not so chirpy  I could be a better mum  even though everyone tells me I'm just fine   my house is constantly a mess and I'm hanging onto my degree by the skin of my teeth and my finances are all over the place  Everything else is chaos   Your ex just seems incredibly immature  You might have thought nothing was wrong but she'd probably been thinking about it a while  My husband left me for someone else when I thought everything was getting better and going well  It took me three years to get over it  I tried to have a relationship in that time but I was just numb and dead inside  even for my own kids  I cared for them  and hugged them and read them stories but inside I was like a void  Just going through the motions xxx Looked up lead poisoning and from the symptoms  It looks like I have it  Thx user  p   "Trying to focus more on myself rather than others"  This    Actually one of my revelations and resolutions for this year  Not in a selfish way  but in a healthful way  I e    in a conversation for example  instead of saying what I think that particular person wants to hear or will make them laugh   happy  I say how I'm feeling   even if it may be unpopular  One example of a broader concept  I can't tell you what to do  but don't be too hard on yourself just because this stems from something mental instead of from a physical illness  Take care of yourself   If you didn't go on the trip  what would you do instead  Would you use that time for self care to set yourself up to do well with your class after they return from the trip  Would you regret skipping the trip  Would you be relieved  Talk to your doctor about long lasting benzodiazepines  Take them lowest dose possible no more than 3 times a week   Talk to you doctor about SSRI   Thanks  Hi FoxesBadgers   Thank you for your very detailed reply  I'll take some time to look through the resources    I'm sorry to hear that you experienced similar issues  I sort of devised a coping mechanism of trying to ignore the overall situation when I lived in Mum's house  but now that it's happening a second time around it feels more difficult to not let it upset me  Visiting family over Christmas and seeing silly things like empty tables makes me cry and scream a little bit inside out of sheer frustration sometimes    I appreciate that hoarding and OCD are different things   Mum does also exhibit various parts of OCD also  which is the bit that outsiders notice  washing hands an excessive amount of times  boiling everything before use  etc   so I suppose I've often lurked mostly OCD content online on the past  I'll certainly check out the specific forums though   I do understand that to her the reasoning must be very real and important  indeed that has always given me a fear of pushing too far  I think that she sort of acknowledges that she has a problem  the issue is though that if you suggest any form of help she just shuts you down immediately   even to the extent of walking or driving away from you  I'll be completely honest  as much as I try to convince her to get some help  I think it is extremely unlikely she ever will  and believe me  I have tried  and continue to do so   She may one day attempt some of the techniques  although a suggestion of that yesterday was met with a clear and final "no thanks"   She's also very bloody stubborn     It does help to know that we're not the only ones out dealing with this issue though  I personally am going through a bit of a dark patch with it at the moment  but keep smiling and hoping  I'm going to have a look through some of your links now  and to the hoarding forums   Many thanks again  Anxiety has destroyed my life as well  im a shell of a person tbh  I've grown apart from my friends  relationships with opposite sex go nowhere fast  I've made little improvements using meds and exercise but the damage is done  I recommend trying different medications asap  also  cut out all caffeine from your life  work out daily   Yes  but not so much these days  I've learned the hard way like you just did that 'dwelling' on simple moments like this is just so much more painful then to  not think  and say something   The way I think about it is almost like  would I rather feel like an idiot now and just get it over with  or think about how much of an idiot I'll be and then feel it ten times worse  I've only recently begun feeling better and even proud at times about who I am  and how far I've come with dealing with SA  and I can tell you it only gets better with time  I don't know if he has OCD per se but he definitely seems to have some sort of anxiety disorder   Sometimes I think maybe he's just agoraphobic and he uses EMS as an excuse to stay in his house all day every day    Klonopin helped me in many ways too but over time I noticed memory problems and overall sluggishness  I got off and it was hell  im still in withdrawals 4 months after getting off  now I have even worse anxiety than before I started kpins  pray you never have to get off I currently take it but I also take it with setroline  The bupropion did initially cause some anxiety but after a while it leveled off  It also did give me some foggy feelings as far as thinking clearly and which was a struggle since I was in college at the time  I take it as needed for GAD and panic disorder and have found it to be a great way to stop the build up of days and days of anxious thought    So I do a few days on  a few days off  using just 1 mg a day  And I've done that for a while now  with no issues  no  i dont think so  i basically made dinner with chicken that was one day past the 'sell by' date   it didnt smell bad and didnt look slimy when i opened the package  but as it is poultry   im afraid of the risk for fp  i made chicken parm  so it was pan fried   then cooked in an oven at 350 for probably 15 20 min I don't think you should feel bad  especially if he knows you've got any sort of germophobia or emetophobia  He'll likely understand and tbh  he'd probably rather not have you see him in that condition  Best you can do is what Nosicknessplease said  clean the bathroom and take care of yourself  trust your immune system  but for mental comfort  have ginger ale and ginger tea on hand if only at least to fight the nausea  can't do much about the d  but let's be real  we'd probably all rather have d over v any day     Just let him be  and when he's well again  have a sit down and let him know you've got a pretty bad case of germophobia emetophobia and you want to be considerate and help where you can  but certain things are where you draw the line  but you'll do about anything else you can to help from a distance if need be  I'm sure he'll understand and getting the subject out in the open is maximum healthy for a relationship anyway  Especially germophobia emetophobia  like that should always be the first thing you let your SO know about in a relationship because they'll be less weirded out like  "did I offend her him " and more like  "oh must be the anxiety  well  I'll back up then give space "  You'll likely be ok  I was in a similar situation a few years back when my boyfriend was staying the night with me at my parents' house  I guess something he ate gave him really bad fp  I really think it was something he ate earlier  because literally none of us got sick and ate all the same stuff he did    he was lying in my room feeling miserable for a time  had already v'd and d'd a bit in the bathroom  and finally said he had to go home  I didn't have such severe emetophobia back then and actually stuck it out with him in the same room and used the same bathroom right after he did all that with no fear or issue  I'd probably never do that now  with the phobia being stronger today than it was back then    He ultimately drove himself home despite my best efforts to get him to stay and let me take care of him  He really didn't want me to see him in that state  like    he just really got embarrassed about all the sickness  I guess  He probably also preferred to be in a more comfortable and familiar setting  too  rather than stuck in the bathroom at his in law's house  you know    So he went home  and I never did get sick at all  no one did  even without bleaching the bathroom after    So you'll very likely be ok  Just talk it out when your boo's better and bleach clean what you can to ease your mind  Good luck  How is your quality of life now  If it lasts for weeks  months  or even years  it's overwhelmingly likely to be a symptom of an anxiety disorder  I've had it on and off since I was a kid  Awful feeling  but if it were going to kill me  I would have been dead years ago  You're good  I'd say your risk is quite low  But my advice in these situations is  when your mind says you're very certainly going to be ill soon  and with emetophobia  the mind is always going off with that  the best thing to do is prepare for it  acquire all you can to weather the ordeal comfortably  I stock up on ginger tea and ginger ale as well as stuff to fight nausea  Peppermint tea helps too  Ginger candies rock  I get water  crackers  and easy to eat fruits like melon and grapes because I know if I get sick  that's all I'll be able to keep down  But the real star of the show is ginger everything   Sometimes just prepping helps ease my mind and then it turns out I don't get sick at all  So while I think you're going to be fine  if you really feel like it's coming and the anxiety won't quit  go out and get these things to ease your mind  because they really will make the experience less hellish  Then you're good    There is this cool website my grandmother pointed me to called stilltasty that will tell you how long things are good beyond their sell by or use by dates  Chicken was 1 2 days  For me  I don't think it's so much distraction just acknowledgement  Like  OK  this is my anxiety talking  Just accept the feeling and let it roll  acknowledge without engaging with the thought    Maybe try to track the times of day activities where your anxiety seems to be more prevalent  If you start to see specific patterns  then maybe employ distraction  Listen to music  go for a walk  grab lunch  read a book  watch something funny on Youtube  etc   Has your OCD been the same intensity for all three years  or have you been steadily getting better    I'm happy you found something that helps  thank you for the advice  I stopped going to a therapist when i still was young because they didn't know what to do anymore and financial issues  Unfortunatly i am really bad in groups or trusting anyone that i don't know  I also have a book that really helped me it's called "A man's search for meaning by viktor frankl"  i will try your book too  i found out on the internet that Ayahuasca or small dosage of MDMA can heal PTSD But i'm scared that I will go insane completely    Hm  that could be an issue since I'm in school  I guess I'll just have to see    Thank you  Now I know I probably shouldn't give up on it right away if I react a little badly Thanks again  So did medication play any role in your recovery   It was the worst experience  I know that benzos can be extremely helpful and I would never tell anyone not to take them but the withdrawal symptoms were out of this world   And i think that when more Tv and cinema roles like this come then more and more people will learn about OCD patients  Thanks a bunch  I've been realizing more and more that it's generally either school related or family  I just feel as if I needed to find some way to cope with it  Thank you for your response  I listen to comedy stations on pandora or spotify  listen to books on audible  I read on kindle  I play crosswords  puzzles anything that forces me to think and concentrate on something other than my anxious thoughts  I take walks with my husband or my dogs   go to the drive in theater  or spend time with a close friend   That really puts me at ease  I can't sit still too long before I start getting anxious again   I have nothing to talk about with them  I just dont share the same interests as other people  As others wrote  keep a good written log of what happened so far   If he tries again to contact you  let him know clearly that you want no further contact and any contact will be reported to the police   Hopefully  that will be enough to stop him  especially since he hasn't approached you in the past year   If he does try again  then do go to the police with your log and all the saved texts you have to file a restraining order   That should put a stop to it  I was just telling my husband how I dislike the gloomy rainy weather we're having in California lately  Unfortunately that's how it is most of December January  Not only that but less daylight  I work 8 5pm so when I get off  it's dark  and it feels like I have no time to do anything  I've been sick too  so it's not like I can be outside in the cold right now  I love being outdoors too  so it drives me nuts being indoors all the time  I feel your pain   I've noticed that prion diseases like CJD and fatal familial sporadic insomnia get a lot of attention from people with health anxiety  probably because of how nasty they are  It's funny  though  since all prion diseases are exceedingly rare    The way I think of it is  MILLIONS of pounds of steak and beef are consumed every year  and an almost imperceptibly small percentage of that results in CJD  and even then  typically in unusual  isolated cases  If there's any disease you should feel safe about not getting  it's CJD any other prion disease  Hey OP  You can PM me  I've dealt with this for almost 8 years These are all great suggestions   I would add to check out  r traumatoolbox   It's for exactly this question   For people to share and trade ideas of what's worked for them to decrease anxiety and reduce depression around their trauma   All my best  I guess it gives me some hope  seeing how things could get better from a bad situation like that  I just hope that I can regain my confidence at some point  I used to be so fucking confident  I could do anything I wanted if i put my mind to it  and now I'm unsure of literally everything  I even ask to go to the bathroom at work  and I'm an adult  And a lot of that confidence I got because of the way she made me feel when we were together  I know it's over and it'll be over forever  I just hope I find someone who can make me FEEL like she did    I'm sorry to hear about your boyfriend reacting to that situation in such a way  I'm glad you guys got through it  and I hope things go smoothly from now on  It sounds like you both know each other well enough to make it work if the effort is put in    Also  i struggle with drug abuse which makes my situation incredibly worse  I'm a daily opiate user  Nothing heavy  just a plant called kratom which is legal where I live  But it's still abuse because I rely on it to get me through the day  I also take pills if the day gets really bad  And That's another thing too  when I was with her   she helped me get off this stuff  Every step of the way she was there until I was clean  And when we split  I started using again  I subconsciously did it as a "fuck you" which was a bad decision  but here I am   Alcohol is actually an anxiety trigger  in the way that it dehydrates you  When you lack water  your body stresses a lot more  Drink water every day  I have cut out alcohol  sugary drinks  caffeine for the most part and have been consuming a lot more water  It's not a cure  but it does make you feel better   I am with you  I suffer from emetophobia  Fear of vomiting  and HA  Winter is the worst for me  I live in Eastern Finland  it's cold and it's dark  My anxiety is always worst at winter  currently panicing about vomiting because I have IBS and been on a flare up for a week  c This is going to be a long night  D Thanks  likewise  I agree partly with mama megs  I was abused by an older man as a teenager and I felt extremely ashamed that I would be turned on by men with similar traits  I don't know if I can separate my turn ons from my sexual trauma yet  I still get triggered by men who look like my abuser  I don't want people judging me because of it  I think for me  ill be embracing it than rejecting it  Or try  Theres this technique called mindfulness that essentially encourages accepting all of yourself  including the parts that are hidden away  Its kinda brought some peace but I routinely forget to practice it  I wouldn't worry about the paying part you'll probably both pay for your tickets individually  As far as dinner goes as a guy I was always told that he is supposed to and I would do so  if it bothers you then don't let him pay for all of it he'll appreciate it I'm sure but won't mind paying  All that aside don't let obsessing about it ruin the fun and good luck  thank you for your response  does help a little bit  what do you mean by isolated cases  Because your job is distracting your brain  I'm exactly the same  Face deep in legal essays for uni for three days and nothing  Finally lay down with an movie and my heart starts palpitating  It's just anxieties nice way of giving us a wave with a wicked grin while saying 'still heeeeeere   didn't think you could get rid of me that easily did you ' It's tough man  When you come out ahead  you feel like you can conquer anything  But most days  I feel like I'm stuck in a rut and it sucks  I see everyone else enjoying life but I'm just over here trying not to lose my mind    I dream for that one day     stop worrying  Heh    I feel actual physical pain in my stomach  throat and  sometimes  chest  and to top it all off  I may get dizzy  I'm not worried about anything    I'm in fucking PAIN  I wish this disease didn't make me carry so much weight  Hiding this shit from the public is agonizing  Sometimes I wish I could break my leg so then people would actually cut me some slack  He would only tell me to "fuck off"   Makes sense     cold and dark contributes to depression  so it would make sense that it can also do that to anxiety   Hi pinkerton8   There must be some of this going around   I just responded to a question a lot like this the other day   I couldn't find my answer to that one  but if you're reading through other people's posts  you might see it   One of the things trauma does  especially based on the kind of trauma it is  is mess with our ability to judge situations and respond emotionally to them   Many people feel numb and dissociated  others "overreact" to everything around them   Working through what happened to you and being able to express your feelings around that  will help you to re establish balance in responding to other things in your life    It's not unusual to go from "I don't feel anything " to "I'm feeling EVERYthing and can't stop "  Oftentimes our inability to feel is actually repressed fear of ALL of those overwhelming feelings underneath coming out     Experiencing feelings during non personal events  like movies  books  other peoples experiences not close to you  lets you know that your "feeling meter" is intact   It just isn't ready to work on  your  stuff right now   Journaling about when you  do  feel  whether to a movie or seeing a bird in your yard or anything else  can help you start down that path   You can begin to  bring that into therapy and talk about the situations where you do have feelings   That will probably help find a lot of clues to helping you to feel in the more personal areas   So  for now  just notice where and when you do have any kind of feeling  sad  mad  glad  etc   and jot down the situation   Eventually you'll see a pattern that might help your therapist to bring you out more   All my best  I cancelled my NYE trip to Iceland due to not yet recovering from anxiety   Or better yet  cut an artery and wait to see how many people roll their eyes and say 'stop bleeding  it's not helping you'  You're a hero  You helped someone despite feeling super anxious  I'm proud of you  You should be proud too  Hugs and thank you for doing this   I've always been confident in my personality  and understand myself very well   It's the overwhelming negative thoughts that keep me anxious and depressed  I absolutely love using the concept you used that "it's just a thought in their head"   it's true  but i can't shake the feelings when i start thinking that way  Been struggling with anxiety depression since I was young  always trying to better my mental health though  it has been quite the fucking struggle  I've always worried about the way I look  and as I'm getting older  early 30s  I feel even uglier  so my confidence is shot  then I worry more about others not talking to me because of it   but again what does it really matter    sigh    Yes it's great that you go to uni without makeup  Nothing to get all done up for  makeup is overrated  natural is nice  Keep up the positivity and kindness    thank you   Excellent advice and what I would suggest as well     I can never emphasize enough to clients the power of having a support network of people who believe you and will be there for you as you talk about and work out what happened and what you want to do with that information  I had a FB profile before with all my acquaintances and friends from elementary school and high school and etc  I gradually stopped posting anything and was less and less tagged in pictures or posts over the years  When I got to college  I just didn't get the point of it and I would just waste my time looking at a feed of people I didn't like or know and every birthday I would get self conscious that I got less messages than the previous year  So at my last semester I deleted my FB  I was out of FB and most social media for a solid 4 months  Then I started university and work and somehow I felt a necessity to connect to the people I actually cared about so I made a new one  Got about 60 friends  all of which I know and talked to  I still don't post anything  I merely only have it for Messenger  But tell you what  I don't care  Scrolling a feed thay doesn't have random people's status and likes all over and just generally seeing stuff I'm interested in has made my FB experience much better  So my advice  Do some cleaning  Remove people  just stick to a small number of people you like  It won't matter if you don't post  none of it will matter actually  So sorry this happened to you   Two options   1  Text this predator back 1x to never contact you again if you haven't already  Be firm and direct  Only one sentence needed  You owe him nothing  No need for any explanation or excuse  He will respond with hostility so make sure you block him  Screenshot texts for evidence just in case they are ever needed    2  Don't text him back anything at all and just block him  The best thing to do with stalkers is to never respond   If you see him at the store again pretend he doesn't exist  Flat out ignore him if he says hello  This guy is a not interested in friendship  He is a predator and took advantage of you after you confided in him  Food borne illness takes anywhere from 6 48 hours  But you'll usually know within about six  Oh hey dude  me too   I'm glad you're in dbt though  I wish I could do it  Turned 21 two months ago  never been kissed  never been in a relationship and etc  When I was in hs I actually made a plan of losing my virginity by 20 lol but you know what  Didn't happen and I'm ok with it  it will happen when it's my time  I generally don't care because I'm trying to be a better person  a better artist  a better me and to actually have self esteem cause I don't want a boyfriend if I'm just gonna be self conscious and a downer all the time  That being said I do feel awkward when I'm with friends and they're all in relationships or have experience and they're talking about it and I can't really say anything  Worst is when they want to include me and ask me why I'm waiting or they give me tips and such  That can get bothersome  But everyone has their pace  I know people who are 25  and virgins  There's no race  there's no prize so  just focus on you and eventually it will hit you  You're not patethic    Thanks a ton for this reply  There seems to be some white particles on it  but if anything harmless like dust is on it  I'll probably convince myself it's mold   well  it was ridiculous he screamed at me  The Victor Frankl book is excellent too   Drugs don't heal PTSD as much as reduce the symptoms  In some US states cannabis can be legally used by those with PTSD  I find it helpful  I do not know about MDMA  I actually going to the movies solo is better  but that also depends on the film  I would have never gone and watch Magic Mike without my girlfriends but otherwise I'm often alone at the movies  That being said I can't do restaurants alone yet  Well fast food yes but going to a restaurant at a table alone  Can't do it  It's silly but I always feel stupid and patethic  I actually never sat a coffee place alone either  Sigh   One of the best ways I've found to help with perfectionism is to switch where you focus  Focus on   progress not perfection      I know that you know that being perfect is an unachievable goal  Even things that seem perfect on the surface  such as a perfect teacup  or a perfect performance   really aren't so perfect if you start to examine them harder    A much more reasonable  and achievable   goal is  progress   Becoming a bit better every day    Another tip is to   shift your focus to your breathing    I think this subreddit already has some tools based around mindfulness meditation  Mindfulness is a game changer because it gets your brain in the habit of being in the present moment  instead of worrying about the future    It's not full proof  nothing is   but it really does help   Thanks for the encouragement  I'm just getting to the point where I feel like I'm becoming a hypochondriac    I feel like I'm on the brink of passing out all the time  I can tell you that Xanax is a controlled substance and highly addictive  That being said  xanax is the least concerning of scripts I've seen  I would say something to your pharmacist  OR call your doctor and inform them if the pharmacist is making criticizing or inappropriate remarks  It just takes one phone call from a doctor explaining the legitimacy of scripts to shut it down  It sucks that you have to  but the amount of people abusing all of the legitimate medications that we actually need  is overwhelming  That's what it's all about   not feeling alone  It's so crazy how depression and anxiety can make one feel so isolated and alone even though millions of us suffer from it     You have to fight that  Our OCD cannot win  You know  cerebrally  that there is no mold  It's far more difficult for a treated piece of wood to grow mold than just lying around under a damp towel for a bit   I can relate to this a lot  I live in Portland its gray and cloudy like 9 months out of the year  I want to move to Arizona or Nevada I feel like I would be way happier   I really appreciate the support  I guess that the only certain thing to do is try to find the culprit behind the problem  whatever it might be  I had something similar  although not as extreme  when I was younger  At around 19 years old or so I realized me and everyone I knew was going to die some day  The realization of that was crushing    I had been getting into samurai philosophy  and so I stole a technique from the samurai who were known to be pretty fearless when it came to death  I practiced a death meditation    The basics of it is you imagine yourself dying in a variety of different ways  Being crushed to death  shot  sliced  swept away in a tornado  etc      This  admittedly  was very uncomfortable for a long time  But after a few months I conquered my fear of death   Part of that process was also figuring out what I thought happened when you die and being comfortable with that fact    I actually recorded an entire podcast about my experience using this meditation  I know we aren't suppose to link stuff  but maybe you will find it to be useful  http   www brilliantside com conquer fear and anxiety using this samurai technique bsp 014  Time  and effort   Been there OP and evemsa is super right  Just have to do it sometimes and stop thinking    Also  in talking to people about my experiences I've found that even those without SA experience this  it's just less persistent  paralyzing for them  takes more to cause     You're not alone in the least and it can get better  All the best to you  Sorry to drag you into the ditch with me haha  But yeah the symptoms are pretty generic and probably applicable to a ton of perfectly fine people   Nice to find someone experiencing the same situation  sometimes it feels like I'm the only one Do your issues with small talk have something to do with that time a couple years back you thought someone's username had a bunch of Greek pillars in it and everyone made fun of you because they were "I"s  If you were a server then why is it your fault that the steak ran late  Also  you say that you told the customer that the dessert was fresh out of the oven but they touched it anyway  and to me that sounds like the customers fault  I honestly think that your manager was harsh for firing you for those incidents  I'm sorry this happened  You are not worthless or stupid or anything  I have a hard time with memory especially when I'm stressed too but it doesn't have anything to do with our intelligence   Yes  Absolutely   I get extremely nauseous and will throw up when I'm having a panic attack   What helps me is going outside into the cold air  or going into the car and cranking the A C on my face   Taking half a gravel helps me also  https   www reddit com r gifs comments 5lti8n little boy saves his baby brother after dresser   That's my post about sort of the same feelings  For me  it's more so the fear of feeling under skilled  overwhelmed  and unintelligent  Not the same  but similar anxiety  Have no advice to give unfortunately      Exact same thing happened to me  Went in the hospital for something else  was extremely anxious and started shaking  BP was along the lines of 170     over 99  Made me get an ECG and near the end of the stay it had dropped down quite a bit  Nicely done   I think that small victories are actually a HUGE part of recovery because I think  more often than not  we take little steps towards wellness rather than huge strides  Those little steps stack up over time until one day you realize how much better you've gotten from a year or two ago    For instance  it was my first day of grad school today  something I was already feeling a bit anxious about  and I found out yesterday that I was exposed to norovirus on New Year's Day  A few years ago this would have sent me into a total anxiety spiral and I probably would have made myself feel sick from anxiety  but I actually managed REALLY well  I was able to reassure myself that it wasn't likely a bad enough exposure to truly get sick  and even if I DID wind up getting sick  I recognized that I could survive it and power through  even if it was really unpleasant   I managed to enjoy my first day of school without worrying about it at all  and guess what  I'm out of the 48 hour window without any symptoms so I'm probably totally fine    This probably seems like a huge victory but to me it feels like a small one  because it was one of many little victories in a long journey of recovery  It was essentially the next logical step towards wellness    So yes  Celebrate the small victories  because they add up to MASSIVE victories in the long run  and always be forgiving of yourself when it comes to setbacks  because it's all part of the process too   I have the exact same issue  I try to challenge it as much as possible and make my life as "normal" and enjoyable as I can  but at the end of the day the same irrational fear and panic absolutely dominates my day to day life  the big victories do feel very empowering though  and I make it my goal to chase that feeling of being able to conquer anything as you say   I've managed to visually suppress it to the point that only family and close friends know or can tell I have it  but it doesn't change what is going on inside my head  It's not exactly easy but I can look completely relaxed while having a full blown panic attack  It's probably the most annoying part of all of this  because while I can apparently pull off leading a "normal" life and appearing that way  people don't get to understand how hard that is for me to do unless I tell them about it  and even then most people don't understand what it is  how it affects me or how to help  So it's best kept as a silent struggle to most    I'm sorry you went through that  I hope they replaced it with something effective   By the time senior year rolled around in highschool all my friends since middle school had pretty much abandonded me  i had zero people to hang with  my SA was so severe I avoided people at all costs   During lunchtime when everyone else was having lunch with their friends  including the friends i once had  i roamed the corridors with no one to talk to   I was so ashamed to be seen by anyone like this that i hid in the bathroom stalls until lunch was over   I didn't even want to be seen in the library   I felt alone  forgotten  desperate for any sort of interaction  yet too petrified to even reach out just to say hi to anyone out of fear of rejection and reliving the ridicule i faced in the past   This happened for pretty much my entire senior year  alone in that stall   I couldve left at any time but the mind has a way of creating it's own prison out of past traumas we don't understand   I mean i still dont have friends but christ if i wasn't so afraid i mightve found a club to do some kind of activity with that year  How does this relate to what you went through   Don't know  maybe i'm still not over it and i hope it gives you some perspective  Thanks for that  it's given me a couple of different approaches to think about        You're right   I can never shut this brain off  it ALWAYS finds something to worry about and be anxious about   Ugh     Thanks for the link  I'm always looking for something to assist in relaxation   Hi  Yes  this is a common symptom of anxiety  sometimes called 'air hunger'  I get it at seemingly random times  and it's horrible  I suspect it has to do with long term breathing habits  For example  being anxious and stressed might cause you to breathe shallowly for long periods of time  without realising it  and then you have an episode of air hunger  Could also be to do with posture  or muscles  or stress hormones    Or all of those  Take your pick   Just have fun and kick ass  Try not to take things too seriously  Thank you for your reply   I have experienced it a few years ago when I was going through a really stressful time and felt very anxious  and it just started to resolve by itself when I felt more happier   Just now  I'm in a situation that is really stressing me out and keeping me anxious  I try going out for a walk  but feel quite weak and light headed   Just feel absolutely wretched right now     What is a gravel  Yeah hit me up  freeDorm exactly like that Step one  Don't ever think you are bad at anything  Instead  Think of yourself as trying to get better  No one sits down at a piano for the first time and plays Beethoven  Conversation is no different  No one is bad  they are just inexperienced  You have to practice  then it will come naturally  I definitely know what you mean when you say its like having two voices in your head  I'm very grateful to still have my rational side intact otherwise im sure I would slip into full on insanity  I'm glad to hear you got the help you need  If you don't mind me asking what medications are you on if any  You just put yourself out there on the internet  Join a club  or organization  I agree  I do have a good support system but it helps more than anything to talk to people going through what I'm going through  Helps me to realize that I'm not completely alone with my symptoms This  Awareness of a potential problem can make it worse  I always find my pulse increases a bit when I start monitoring it  Of course it's normal to feel anxious about certain things  like an important event such as an exam or a job interview  The problem   an anxiety disorder   starts when someone begins to feel anxious abnormally or irrationally   I would argue about the curable uncurable aspect of these disorders  I was diagnosed with severe generalised anxiety disorder and depression years ago  I've used several medications which didn't help at all  and then I went through cognitive behavioural therapy which did indeed help  but it's still pretty bad and definitely still severely affects my quality of life   Most people who are prescribed the medication react positively  and on top of this CBT can help a lot in terms of coping mechanisms and staying out of the trap that anxiety disorders leave in your brain  So anxiety disorders are definitely very treatable  but I wouldn't say they are curable  If someone has an anxiety disorder  it will take either prescribed medication or a cognitive effort to continually suppress it throughout their life  I have this problem too You probably don't have rabies  but since you DID get bit  it might be worth going to see a doctor  That being said   u lostinedental is right  Rabies is typically very rare  No problem  Hope it helps  there are tons of great tips on there   I haven't vomited in years but when I feel sick  I tend to obsess over it too  My way to fix it is to confront it  Say stuff to myself like "Yeah  that was really gross and felt really bad  but it's okay "   Thinking about it is probably making it worse for you  Is there something else you can distract yourself with    BTW  as someone who still tends to avoid vomiting  and is terrified of vomiting in public   holy shit  go you  You are a bad ass  If you're worried about schizophrenia  then you're probably not developing schizophrenia   Most people who develop psychotic disorders aren't aware that they are doing so   they lack "insight" into their own illness  The fact that you're worried in the first place is a good indication that you're NOT developing a psychotic disorder like schizophrenia   The fear of schizophrenia  meanwhile  is a VERY common fear in people who struggle with anxiety  I myself dealt with it for a long time  and still occasionally do  It feeds directly into the fear of losing control that so many with anxiety issues have   Rest assured that you likely don't have schizophrenia  and even if you did  you probably wouldn't even be the first to notice  Isnt there an OCD foundation website   On there I believe you can find doctors  I share the exact same fear  It's really  really debilitating  I love and depend on my family so much and my friends are everything to me  I can't stand the thought of losing them yet it's all I can think about for the past couple of weeks  Trust me you are NOT alone  there are many other people feeling like this  It's made me appreciate everyone so much more but it also scares the shit out of me  I'm going to a drop in therapy session tomorrow because it's out of control right now  I unsubscribed for a while  b c I was one searching for reassurance and I wanted to wean myself off the drug so to speak  but I come back tonight to find that people are still looking for tons of reassurance  still censoring words  etc   Bummer   Exactly this  except recently it's actually been helping more  with my anxiety at an all time high  I've been vomiting a lot this past month due to it  it's helped with the nausea a LOT as well as my state of mind  being mostly alone people I know  if I'm going out just a hit or two will mellow me out  more then that and BRING ON THE SOCIAL ANXIETY AND OVER ANALYZING  Try another therapist  I know it sounds dismissive but I tried 8 before I found the right one  Take the leap  Get some more help  You need serious help  NOW  If this is affecting your physical health  you need help  now   Your nausea is probably almost entirely anxiety   EAT  It's sometimes the last thing you want to do on this kind of medication but oh my god is it worse if you don't  Stick to the BRAT diet if you have to  bland foods  but eat  I liked the post about identifying what threatens you in social situations and tackling them  I've gone through it every day for the past month and the celebrity deaths everywhere made it worse  No one who I've had a close connection with has died  my parents are relatively young  early 50s  and my sibilngs are 30 and 10  I'm 20 and everyone  except me  is perfectly healthy  I don't have any reason to worry right now but the thought of it happening one day brings me to my knees  I just can not bare it  I found sipping on ginger ale  I prefer the Canada Dry brand   having ac on  and not taking too hot of a shower in the morning all help a little bit   I also have anxiety and my most common symptom is nausea     I also like this website I think the second technique is really helpful    http   www anxieties com 57 panic step4  Thank you so much for your replies   It's quite scary  I hope we both get better  x It's been a month already    It's probably to late for me already   Edit  exactly 20 days from today since I was bit    Thank you so much for your reply  I'm seriously thinking about it  I hope you figure everything out x Thank you so much for your reply  I'm seriously thinking about it  I hope you figure everything out x I got out of the car even though I knew people would see me Thank you so much  That's a much better perspective   Anxious feelings and an anxiety disorder are two completely separate things  Everybody will feel anxious at some point in their life  not everybody will have an anxiety disorder  That said  this is a support sub so if you don't believe that anxiety disorders exist  this is not the place to discuss it  I encourage you to open your mind and speak to sufferers of anxiety disorders to educate yourself before making harmful blanket statements that serve no purpose other than to stigmatize mental illness   Thank you for that  Yeah something ginger could help with nausea   is that brand a spicy ginger  I would prefer something mild  Sorry you get it too  it's a horrible symptom   Count me in  I'd be willing to participate in a Google Hangout type conversation to push the comfort zone further as well  I started to post again on Reddit  I think this is my 3rd comment this year    Yeah  sometimes  Because if i dont speak for a while  my voice gets really weird when i actually start to speak  So just saying hi or bye after like an hour of not talking freaks me out  But hang in there  Was this your first therapy session or have you been speaking with this therapist for some time now  Either way  I think it's great that you're talking to someone  When I was first diagnosed with GAD my general practitioner was my sounding board and it made a world of a difference to vocalize my emotions to a third party without fear of judgment  and I've made huge strides since seeking that help  Keep it up    My anxiety manifests with very intense physical symptoms like the ones you've mentioned  so I totally know where you're coming from and they definitely don't go away after talking it out  at least for me   I would advise just taking some time to practice self care  avoid caffeine and other stimulants  get plenty of sleep and make sure you're eating well and staying hydrated  Exercise has been a big help in keeping my emotions in check  so if you're interested in giving that a try I highly recommend it   Bottom line  take it one day at a time and make sure your needs are being met  Best of luck  Talk to your university therapist  there will have been many and I mean many people that have gone through this and sought help from the schools services  I'm not a doctor  but from what I understand  the rabies virus can remain dormant for months  or even years  If you catch it before the major symptoms appear  I believe it's treatable  Since you're coherent and able to post online  I'll take that as a good sign   Although  it's probably because  as the user above said  you don't have rabies  Still  my first impulse would be to get checked out after getting bit by a strange dog  even just to check for something other than rabies  You're almost definitely fine  though  Absolutely  Everything I drink is caffeine free and it makes a big difference  I think you missed the part of my post where I said I have not been in a real relationship ever before in my life  which is because of social anxiety  But thanks for the reply anyways  No problem  Glad to help   By isolated cases  I mean instances where multiple people get CJD from the same source   "outbreak" would probably have been a better term to use  Instances like that might make the actual rate of CJD seem greater than it really is  thus creating needless worry  if that makes any sense   I'm really sorry to hear that you're in such a tough spot right now  I promise you can recover from this  Please try and get some food  even if just a tiny bit    you need a little time to rest and recover   If you need anybody to talk vent to  please don't hesitate to message me  I know how you feel and I wouldn't wish it on anyone  Thanks man  I've been getting some pretty bad panic attacks because of this whole thing  hopefully I can convince my parents to let me go to doctor  I just hope that dog wasn't rabid  The bite didn't break the skin as far as I can tell and I was wearing jeans    So hopefully that helps  Again  thanks for the advice man  I appreciate it  Thanks  I have brought it up before and thought maybe I shouldn't bring it up until I'm sort of asked about it  I just don't want to get too far into things and then she finds out and it weirds her out or something like that  Maybe wouldn't be too devastating for her but it might be for me if I'm really digging her    im the same age and i have this problem too  so you are not alone  take some days to just relax and think about what you really want in life  maybe a new hobby will help you find out who you are  but dont stress it  most people dont know what they want in life when they are young  I hear you  I suffered from emetophobia during my childhood and teenage years  If you haven't tried it  I found that seltzer water greatly helped that particular fear  I have exactly the same problem as you  My body basically shuts down when I drink any more than just a little caffeine  I think it's mainly caused by a caffeine intolerance  for me   but because the symptoms are so similar to anxiety  it actually causes me to have panic attacks as well  I've been mostly caffeine free for years now  the most I can handle is the caffeine in a single can of Coke  Perfect  perfect comment  You know those prank electric buzzers  That people could hide in their hands and then you get shocked and OUCH  And then next time you see them  they offer to shake your hand  but you're a little wary about it  It's kind of  sort of  a little bit like that    Except maybe you were shocked really badly  or maybe shocked a lot over a long period of time  and now sometimes you get angry about it or depressed about it because it really sucked and it feels unfair that it happened    Or sometimes you're out minding your own business  having a good day grocery shopping or whatever and then you see somebody's hand and suddenly your heart rate goes up and you flashback to being shocked and all you want to do is leave the store and hide hide hide hide until you feel safe  Or maybe kick them or scream  But mostly hide   Or you're sound asleep but wake up in a cold sweat with heart pounding for the third time that night and you desperately wish you could just fucking forget about it    Or you have to go to work and everybody thinks handshakes are no big deal  so you try to act like it is no big deal  and logically you even know it is no big deal  but your body keeps reacting with strong fear responses like it is a BIG SCARY DEAL  Tight chest  racing heart  goosebumps  feelings of dread  trembling  sometimes more or less symptoms that may or may not be visible   So you try various medications  therapies  coping strategies  etc to try to get back to "normal" so you don't have excess stress after  aka post  a trauma    from your post traumatic stress disorder   I can't speak for everybody but that metaphor is about the best I can come up with  Just replace electric buzzer with situation s  more physically and emotionally painful than anybody ever wants to experience  No problem  Glad to help  The fact the bite didn't break the skin is very good  and even if it had  the numbers would still be in your favor  I'm very confident that you'll be ok  Good luck to you  Escapism no doubt  but some times it makes me more anxious if i think about it   My anxiety focuses on schizophrenia psychosis and the likes  So because i'v read that STPD  Schizotypal personality disorder  tend to live in their own "fantasy" worlds  my anxiety skyrockets when i remember that   This is also why i tell people on  r Anxiety they should never google stuff to find out what they are feeling  because you can really fuck with yourself  Sounds like it  If my anxiety goes up I feel like I can't touch food  Haven't been able to eat more than one meal per day the past two months  Feels bad   Thank you  I actually spoke to my mom today and she's willing to up hills with me and practice  I'm hoping I break out of this fear soon and fast  Yeah you're defiantly right   I never thought of keeping a diary with me  I'll try it out sometime this week or the next  I appreciate your advice feeling a lot better with this  This happens to me  My grandmas dementia was very bad and although my mum seems in perfect health I get terrified  I think that what you're saying about her being forgetful and misplacing things is very normal but your anxiety is making you hyper aware  And for some positive news  doctors are very close to finding medication that allows us to control things like dementia in the same way that we would diabetes  In the mean time encourage her to take up a healthy diet  regular exercise and some quality sleep  I'm aware that it's possible and for many people it can definitely be treated to the point where it does not exist  And that could definitely be defined as being "cured"  I would love for that to be the case for all sufferers  but until it is I can't personally blanket these disorders as curable  I can't say it's curable while I've suffered from it for almost a decade   As for going through life  I feel like I live a very good life and my anxiety disorder is probably one of the only real problems I have  It is intertwined with absolutely everything I do and if I'm doing something new or even just slightly different  it's always very difficult  There are less than a handful of places I feel safe  secure or comfortable   I guess I'm just speaking from personal experience   this disorder has plagued me for a long time with absolutely no end in sight  I fight extremely hard just to have a semi normal existence and it's never ending and incredibly draining  I wouldn't say it's spicy at all  I just feel all the other brands have a tin like taste   Just tell him that you feel very uncomfortable with him doing these things and please stop  If he does not  tell him you are going to report him to the child protective services  http   laocdtreatment com   Jonathan Grayson I was talking with my boyfriend and joked that I'll just be one of those failing youtubers type deal and he suggested to me maybe even try it just for a hobby while I sort more stuff out    I think I might start doing something like that  like streaming or youtube just to keep me busy  I prefer to be busy rather than twiddling my thumbs and over thinking  I do need more hobbies anyway For sepation anxiety  looking at favorite photos of the person helps me   I feel anxious when I can't see the person  but looking at a picture of them gives me some comfort   Watching a video with them in it can also be helpful   Also  distraction helps  watching movies or doing things to keep your mind away from anxious thoughts  The optometrist sounds like he has issues of his own  It's hard when people make assumptions about people  and feel the need to offer unsolicited advice  Honestly it's completely reasonable to express yourself by saying something like "oh thanks  but I know this already" or "yes  that's interesting  Mind if we get back to the eye appointment "   Maybe this isn't the best advice  but sometimes people don't understand their assumptions are wrong  and you have to show them that you're capable and intelligent and aware on your own    It's hard to do this at first  I know sometimes I sound passive aggressive if I haven't practiced assertiveness in a while  But practicing is the best place to start   Sorry you experienced that too   It's a process  and we're here to help  I hope you keep getting better and learn those coping mechanisms  It really helps  I'm just freaking out today over how time seems to move so quickly  Like there's not enough time in a day  When I get home from work  I'm just so drained  There's a lot of stuff I want to do  mostly art related   but what I really need to do is to just go off by myself sometime  it's the only way I can recharge   Yes I didn't see that part but I wouldn't bring this up on your own  If the topic of previous relationships come up and she asks you the question then of course be honest  This is the reason why   If you tell her this upfront and she doesn't know you well she will automatically think that is a red flag and may cease contact    If she knows you better and then finds out then she will be more likely to give you a chance if she has already likes your personality  You can Aldo say that you've only had a few relationships in the past and no reason to go into detail if not needed    The reason I mentioned Craigslist is because from what I heard  more "experienced" people use that site for hook ups and relationships so they are likely looking for people that have experience as well  Does that make sense  It wasn't my first therapy session  but the first time talking with my therapist via phone since nobody could take me to my therapy session today   Yes  It became so problematic for me that I had to stop drinking caffeine for almost 2 years  I cut out coffee  sodas with caffeine  even chocolate  I'm just now able to slowly drink a bit of it again  I started by drinking decaf coffee  decaf coffee DOES still have caffeine  just very little  then half caf  now I can have a very small cup of regular coffee once in a while   So yes  it can cause anxiety  because it is a stimulant  If it becomes very bothersome  try cutting back on the amount  If that doesn't help  cut it out completely      Oh no  I've gotten steadily better  I was a wreck  and I do mean  a wreck   my first few months  One you realize that they're thoughts and they don't define you  they're just part of you  like an arm or a finger   it becomes easier  I'm to the point now where when it does flare up  which isn't often   I can just let the thoughts go and move on with my day  Thank you  I said in another comment that my boyfriend has suggested that I maybe start youtube or streaming just as a way to busy myself so that I have a goal to work towards  I think that's a good idea as it will give me something to do while I work out what I really want to do my health anxiety definitely peaks around this time of year That just makes my stomach drop for some reason  I have one too it's great  Do it while listening to podcasts audiobooks   Oh that's great  I'm glad it worked out for you    Hi guys  sorry it took so long to respond  It's been busy  Thank you to everyone who has commented here  I really mean that  I'll be responding to each comment individually  but I wanted to post an update here     Besides the texts on Sunday  he hasn't really tried talking to me since besides a few Snapchats being sent  I don't exactly mind  because space feels good  besides being like almost 1 000 miles away now as well  I'm now feeling like maybe some of this is my fault  or maybe he subconsciously resents me because I don't feel comfortable having sex or being nude  It's just a mess and I've been trying to stay busy with work to keep my mind off of it  You cant help someone unless they want help     Its very unfortunate but it sounds like your dad doesnt necessarily want to change     have you talked to him    Like sit down and tell him what he does to you and your family   Hopefully he will understand he has a problem  because thats usually the hardest part     I hope it works out for you  and there are tons of rehab programs to help   Maybe getting him outside more would benefit him  I dont know the extent of his injuries    good luck  you can always hmu if you need help or anything  What's even scarier is that he has never shown a side like this before in these two years  He has always been cautious and mentioned that he hated trying to initiate sex with me in general because I have a habit of recoiling  even if I don't mean to  and he didn't want to "feel like he was raping me"    I worry that maybe this is subconscious hatred resentment of me and my issues  lack of self confidence love  etc  I'm using this next month and a half away from home to really evaluate this and have literal space  but whether my hunch is true or not  I may have to agree with you too    I've been reading a book about anxiety  and in the book they say that anxiety disorder is not a mental illness   We have a fear that we will go crazy or lose it when we have a bad panic attack  but it is not actually going to happen   It's completely normal that you can't think rationally in a state of panic    The adrenaline spikes  and your body goes into fight or flight mode    We live in a fast paced stressful world  and more people than you know deal with some sort of anxiety disorder   People with anxiety disorders are normal  we just can't handle stress as well as others  I was ten not nine oops it was just after my bday  You are absolutely right  I wish I could just look past this  but a few days later  I am still feeling shocked and hurt  I don't know if this is related to flashbacks or not  but I am taking this a lot worse than I thought I would   I feel like if his apologies were more sincere feeling besides some awkward texting  like  calling me  for christ's sake   it would be worth  trying to get past the shock  But since all I get is a weak "I'm sorry  I feel like crap" message  I feel more inclined to just end it  I'm not sure he takes this seriously  maybe it's because he may resent me somehow  and I feel like that's all my fault  Ok cool I will check it out  I've had ginger ale in the past that has burned a bit  Its a long story but essentially we were running a special menu that night in addition to our regular menu  The special menu had to he fired separately but in conjuction with the normal menu  I had been quadruple sat  it was Christmas Eve and only one person at that table ordered the special menu  So I fired the next course and totally brain farted on the one order off the special menu  There was a lot going on  I tried to think how to describe it  but I couldn't and it became uncomfortable   I imagine that's the way for many of us   So  please don't be offended if you don't see many responses   All I can say is  terrible things happened   Things you wouldn't wish on your worst enemy   Because of that  and because some of my trauma is new  I don't know the full scope of how it affects me yet   I know some of my triggers  but often find myself in circumstances and triggered and it was not expected   Those situations can throw me for a loop for days or even weeks   Often I will flash back to the moments of trauma  and I will do nearly  anything  to escape whatever whomever is the cause   These episodes  can manifest negatively such as me shouting at people   However  I cannot control it   I live my life in a near constant state of fear because of that   "Will I get kicked out of a place  or arrested today   Worse "  Another big issue is validation   Many of us struggle to validate our own trauma   This post is basically asking us to validate it to you  a stranger  just to satisfy your curiosity   I know you didn't mean anything by it  but it will definitely make some of us reluctant to respond    This looks super confusing lol I'm sorry that happened to you  too  Thank you for your support     My boyfriend has had more than his fill a handful of times in our relationship so far  but has never been like this before  I fear it's resentment peeking through and that  yes  it would only get worse  I feel like this is my fault for not being normal and capable of just whipping my clothes off and having sex like a typical girl  but I can't really fix that  and I'd rather walk away than feel guilty for something I have a hard time changing  I felt the same   It was nerve wracking heading to basic  but its not terrible  There are some suck days  and some not so suck days   Youll always be hungry and tired   But it got my life on track  I hope it can help you in a similar way   Just enjoy it   Its the most fun thing you never want to do twice    Yes  it sucks that you basically just have to try medications until you find one that fits   But  if you find a medication that works  you can feel and function so much better   If the side effects are bad enough that it's not worth the benefit  you can bring this up with your doctor and likely try another medication   Most all side effects are temporary   I'm a woman  so can't speak to ED  but I can understand why that's a horrifying prospect   Bring up your concerns with your doctor   Maybe you can start by trying medications with less severe side effects or low incidence of ED     I had my first panic  anxiety attack this morning  My chest was tight I couldn't breathe  I'm emotionally drained   It's horrible  I hope you find peace  Try to make conversation with someone   Give them a compliment or ask them a question   I feel less out of place if I'm talking with people    Yeah  mood  emotions  can all really affect your appetite   Some days nothing tastes good  and I can be hungry  but have no desire to actually eat   As long as it's not happening all the time  it's probably okay   Sorry about the person passing  Congrats  That might sound minor to some but it's a huge deal to many others  you deserve to be proud of yourself   Oh yeah  all the time  When my heart starts racing really fast and I get short of breath  I also get nauseous  Yes  I don't have severe anxiety  but too much caffeine brings out my anxiety  I try to drink a maximum of one cup of black coffee each morning or I just drink herbal tea instead  Think about it this way  in the 60s  give or take  a woman was screaming for help from her attacker  everybody naturally thought somebody else would call  nobody called  She ended up dead because the attacker came back  I believe I've experienced this  It just feels like I want to move  but I need to stay still more  like giving into a compulsion  Eventually I can move  but there's usually a prolonged period where my body won't catch up with my mind  which is usually racing  It's a weird feeling  like my body feels extra tense in a nervous tingling way    I always just said I felt frozen from anxiety and fear  I know I've read about people who literally freeze up during great stress  I didn't know there was a more scientific way to describe it   YES  Its so bad for me  I cut coffee out  its not in your head  I miss it  but its worth it   Caffeine is known to trigger anxiety  It's common enough that my psych warned me off it  Yeah I certainly go through 'phrases' of this  just crying and not even knowing why anymore  I think sometimes it's to just do with things that may still be on our mind  but we're not consciously aware of it  yet our bodies are trying to sort of help us through it  I don't know  Hey there  I really do understand your indecisiveness  try looking up aboulomania as a starting point  I think that will help you get a better understanding  I don't like making posts  anywhere  often because I feel the need to reply to everyone who responds otherwise I'm just ignorant  I stress because I can't think of a good reply to every comment then I stress because I haven't replied and it goes on in a circle   I'm sorry     virtual hug   I don't know how to make this feeling go away  but I experience the same thing  not about being stupid but I have an endless  running commentary of self criticism focused on being careless and making mistakes   in case it makes you feel any better knowing you aren't alone   I've found coloring books super cheap on wish com  I can't seem to find these connect the dots though  But even when I'm not having a panic attack  there's the pressure   Thanks for this insightful post   Hey there  I wish I had some better advice for your  but I just want to let you know that you're definitely not alone  Every time I start seeing someone  I get so anxious and freaked out about every little thing that it makes me feel like I'm better off alone  The second I don't get a text back or I see an unanswered snapchat  I'm convinced they don't like me anymore  Then my self confidence plummets and I end up doing something that makes the situation worse  The best way I've found to get through these times is to keep myself distracted and busy with other things  especially things like exercise that remind me that I'm still a great person without needing validation from a relationship  But I definitely feel for you and hope you're able to find some coping mechanisms that work for you  Thank you so much for responding   It really does help to know that I'm not the only one with this fear  Hi    just a response to let you know I read your post and am sorry for the way things are going for you right now   I can't relate to the specific anxieties you have  but I relate to the part where you say you have to hide it from others and can't share it  It's pretty isolating  IMO     Does your therapist know that you're popular in school so that you're basically hiding in plain sight when you're there   If you can't find the source try and clean where you first encountered it  If that doesn't work  clean yourself and put your brain to work as hard as you can to get your mind off of it  I play video games and watch documentaries to keep my brain busy  Keep going and don't dwell on it   Thank you so much  Thanks for the support  I was able to make it in around 11 and I'm just thankful that I work for such a supportive employer  They offered to let me come in whenever I'm ready and work from home as necessary as long as my work gets done    I really appreciate the advice  It's true  As soon as I made it to work I was totally fine   What ended up happening  You doing okay  The therapy session happened  This happened when I heard my step dad and mom fighting  I tried to keep myself anonymous  but soon my step dad found out I called and was so  so angry with me  The officers and my mom assured me I did the right thing though  It's hard when you're not sure  but I think it's better to be safe  I've heard of people getting assaulted and no one helping because they didn't think there was anything wrong or they thought  someone  would call for help  You're very welcome  If you ever find it flaring up feel free to PM me  I've made great friends through this sub  Try volunteering  You said that you thought about becoming a teacher  perhaps there are some after school programs that you could volunteer in to help kids with their homework  Keep yourself busy  like that you won't have the time to dwell about life    I'm in college  I didn't know what I wanted my major to be  I just knew that I wanted to work with children  I only knew that because I volunteered at an after school program and loved helping the kids with homework and just talking to them  I'm now working on my degree to be a social worker for at risk youth    Your path in life dose not find you  You need to go out and look for it  L theanine my friend Thanks    This is a good  simple thing to keep in mind  This looks interesting and like it might help me  I think I might try this   High school can be a drag because most of the classes are required and you're set on some unilateral path  it feels forced  College is way different  Think about it as a way to find yourself and what you're interested in  It's the beginning of your adult journey really  You mentioned a bunch of subjects  Look forward to being able to take the most diverse classes you can find your first year   take psychology and computers  and anything  You'll find something that you lean towards and enjoy   As far as right now goes  volunteer somewhere or find a cooking class to try  Ask your high school teachers or guidance counselor where to look for those kinds of opportunities in your community   From what you say  I don't think giving medication a shot would be a bad idea  I recently started taking medicine for anxiety  lexapro   the first day or two I felt hungover to be honest  but since then it has helped a lot  Hopefully you have a good doctor and they won't be just guessing your medication  My doctor asked me a lot of questions about my lifestyle  concerns  habits  all kinds of stuff to help get me on the right medicine  I'm sure as you let them know what you're worried about they can work with you    also  if it helps at all  they almost always start you on a very low dose  and then bump you up after a few weeks if all is going well  This hopefully would help you to notice any side effects before you are at a dosage where it might become a problem    I'll also say that I feel way more like myself than I have in a long time since I started medication  I don't feel numb or anything  my emotions are the same but I can handle them way better     Edit  I forgot to add that last bit   Great  I saw your other post and then saw here that you were having a rough time today  so I'm happy for you that it ended up happening     YES  Decaf everything forever  Great job  OP  You could have saved someone's life     Freeways are tough because you are "trapped" between exits  That is what I'm struggling with  but I'm getting better  I've pushed on to a few more exits now  4 in a row is the most   I thought it would kind of 'level' out but the anxiety is still gradually increasing with each passing exit    I think once you know that you are ok to drive the car if the anxiety hits you feel more and more confident  I'm not sure I'll be doing interstate travel anytime soon  but its so very nice to at least be able to get onto the freeway  I was basically frozen at the entry before   Were I live has horrible traffic and the freeways are pretty well full 24 7  so I figure if I can make them here than I should be able to do it anywhere        The trick if anyone from the future is reading this  Do one exit and keep doing it  Do it 5 times in a row  have a break for an hour do it again 5 times in a row  Then keep doing it  Do it every single day  Even if you do one exit 50 times if you can make that one exit without the anxiety spiking than its much easier to carry on  Thank you  Feel free to message me anytime regarding this  it would be a huge help  Do you vomit with it too  I hate feeling like this  It comes and goes  It's not one of my standard anxiety symptoms  so when it does peak  it makes me more anxious   Hyper ventilation can actually cause this  Especially if you're worried about your breathing you tend to breathe more than you need to  reducing the C02 content in your blood a lot and making your breathing rhythm weird  might feel like you can't take a breath  elevated heart rate etc    It's not harmful at all and is normally regulated by the body but with anxiety you can focus on it too much and prevent your body from getting back into its rhythm   Try taking deep breaths through your nose  holding for 4 6 seconds and breathing out slowly through your mouth  Having a conversation with someone also helps as when youre concentrating on that your body takes over your breathing  Like most things  which is horrible for us     I'd love to  but even on the chats here do I say uninterested shit people will just leave me and that's the story of my social life  Therapy doesn't produce instant results  Give it time  listen and try your best  All will be well  There will be ups and plenty of downs in recovery  Yes to glasses  I'm always feeling the area around we're the ends are on my head above my ears  Thoroughly convinced there is going to be a permanent imprint  I have always done to help  Anxiety comes from within  so a distraction helps keep calm so you can address yourself later  sometimes i get mine in my sleep  ill wake up with a fast heartbeat and its thumping against my throat    eyes are bloodshot     and then i cant sleep for the rest of the night As long as you aren't going for something pointless like music  college is definitely worth it   Yes  caffeine makes me more anxious  If I drink a lot of tea in a short amount of time  I will also become very anxious   The cure  besides cutting down on caffeine  I find that taking salty food or isotonic drinks help to mitigate the anxiety  You can try adding some salt into your water to drink  You don't have to go to university right away  And once you're not going straight from high school to uni  a lot of schools have mature student status which can override any missing credits  or offer ways to make up for them  I felt so similar at your age  I felt so pressured to take the right classes and pick the right college program  and I ended up hating the program and dropping out because my anxiety and ADD were getting so bad from all the pressure  I started working full time at a coffee shop and worked up to a retail job that was a lot less stressful  and now I'm back to the same coffee shop franchise because that retail job ended up being a lot of unsafe work environments and abusive managers  I'm in a dump and feel trapped in the fast food industry  but if there's anything good it's that I don't have a degree being unused weighing down my shoulders and I have all the time in the world to pick what I want to do  Seriously  college is a giant ball of stress and there's no shame in taking time to think about it when you don't have the pressure of graduation on your shoulders
