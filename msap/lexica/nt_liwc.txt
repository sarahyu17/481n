believe So there is some serious consequences that could come from it You should always use a condom with a ONS even if she says she is on the pill First she could be lying and trying to get pregnant it happens and secondly and most likely she could have a STD It definitely feels better without a condom and I've had plenty of one night stands without one but that wasn't exactly smart Just please

completing medals I have this one female friend that's always unreliable about hanging out so her plans for NYE looked like they were falling short so I invited her out few hours go by figure she wasn't up to coming out I'm like an hour away in a city she lives in the suburbs she then tells me she's not coming up but invites me over I tell her no because I had plans then she gets mad at me for not telling her about those plans when I invited her up when we both know she wasn't going to come up in conclusion I know nothing DL is okay Good try on cleans but you really did a deadlift into a

extremely helpful It's also nice for newer players or those who just returned This one's amazing and probably took hours upon hours of research time I was debating between this one and Helping Hand but from how detailed it is I decided to put it here in the end I have characters who would disagree with you I'm pretty sure at the Rogue One screening I went to they took out trailers so they could shove more god damn commercials in there Did Jagex really need to reveal that Armadyl is gay early on in the quest when he references the musical Cats later on anyway I understand But what are the general guidelines in the law When does a country want to get rid off the potential prisoner a tourist in our case and when they jail them there Yes there is a defense called choice of evils It meams that the crime committed was a lesser evil than the alternative say letting someone die of poisoning It is somewhat limited but does come up on occasion They both fire at an angle slightly off center That talent procs off healing station rez I'm new to the game and loving it thus far but what are some of the other issues Balancing issues for classes or game modes I'm currently leveling a new character from to solely in Survival currently level I'm having a lot of fun doing it but I'm not sure I would recommend it You can't use the gear you get as a reward because it is all high end ie you have to be level to equip it Also once you do hit the gear that you do get will mostly only be gear score and will be useless very quickly Also it's pretty slow as you need three to four successful extractions per level to level up and that is hours each session assuming you extract However if you just love the mode as I do then it is worth it Also you could just alternate and run a couple Survival runs then do some story missions or events to mix it up Why did you post the same thing days ago but remove the link you posted then https www reddit com r Bitcoin comments 5khpwn double your

of a Rousey fight She has like fights that have lasted less than a minute It didn't necessarily 'work out' it's just the reality of the atmosphere composition currently Populations of animals that couldn't survive with today's atmosphere haven't and species that can do The atmosphere has changed quite a bit over the history of the earth abundant to non existant Oxygen C02 at various times Living things that can take advantage of what's in the air and use it to survive are the ones that succeed One common example of this is the dinosaurs They were able to be gigantic and thereby consume more food because there was MUCH more oxygen in the air during that time An animal that large couldn't be successful in today's atmosphere and that's why there aren't any anymore So in summary the organisms that have survived in the world are the ones able to take advantage of the air in their environment and use it to be successful Listening to my pump up playlist and avoiding social media '

doesn't mean she wants to be a man qbd is a total joke dude please just go do it you can literally just bring a super antifire and ignore every single mechanic and just eat through it allwith a bob getting clean efficient near foodless trips requires some practice and good stats gear but to just kill the boss once is not REMOTELY hard i havent played in months and went on an hour long trip today with no problems you will be fine i think that only works well if you're a real super pro dribbler in my experience the biggest sidden boost I got in 2v2 was learning to maintain good space from your teammate so you're always ready to go offence or defense depending on what happens And never go for the risky aerial shots Most other players WILL go for dumb risky shots and it's amazing how much you can rank up just waiting around to take advantage of your opponents' mistakes why do you assume redditors are better than the average player And this is my end game ship I plan on flying this and my

times already happy new year lads Bonus cringe for the Minion modern art on the wall ONES I Would Like to Fuck you Again I used to be in the same boat as you Having the holy paladin shoulders I figured that damaging myself would actually increase healing on my beacon targets as other healers healing me redirects to them But looking at my logs from the past and now I can definitely say it is more mana efficient to HS on CD which you should be doing anyway and trying to get efficiency on your IoL Yes IoL increases healing of FoL but if you don't need that massive heal HL heals pleanty especially if it crits The only time I find myself using LotM is when I'm having to move to a mechanic and people are taking damage AND my HS is on CD If you want I can link you some logs and take a look at yours to compare LotM usage vs other abilities Yes logically but would you let player camp the enemy goal to disturb goal keeping That's just weak it turns the game in a 2v2 Would you demo the goalie every single time you get a chance on goal Random demo anyone who wants to hit the ball No or if you would you have some serious lack of skill in the game EDIT about not being aware of surroundings it's bullshit if you claim that you can dodge every bump or demo with good surroundings You can't turn your camera quickly enough there is too much to watch etc it's just not possible d r X HECK YA Going to a formal event and I'm pretty excited to dress up Fixed it http puu sh t7aJ8 e992545b5c jpg Ps4 The only thing that throws me is why they are playing singleplayer when they could be doing an old school LAN party with something classic The only reason you are able to watch a movie at the theatre is because they play ads They don't make much money from the movie tickets and they have a ton of overhead with building expenses staff projectors media server sound system chairs etc Many theatres lose money on ticket sales alone and depend on concession advertising special event revenue to stay profitable So Cineplex doesn't exist without these things If you like watching movies in the theatre deal with it I hope this game cheers me up cause so far this is my worst new year's day it's already in Greece There's plenty video out there We are aware of how it works Thanks for reminding me TWD is on Good joke you should do standup comedy Nineteen thousand five hundred forty eight A lot of people are giving rules of thumb based on CP but the real rule is ring color If the ring is deep red just use a berry and Ultra Ball and don't be shocked if it still breaks out The species and CP don't matter really You don't need to remember the CP scale and catch rate of each species just look at the ring color Pikachu is a lot easier than the starters You'll notice the ring color is more orange than red compared to the starters I had Ultra Balls a couple weeks ago I'm down to now I expect to be out by the end of next week And that's fine with me  this is why I saved them up in the first place let the promotions begin D I'll bet you're a Patriots Yankees and Lakers fan too r mariobaseball I heard the same thing about power of puzzles I don't know if that one was ever awarded They were pretty hard and I'm pretty sure everyone just googled someone else solving the answer So maybe they canned it because of that But why it just means people want your product Maybe because its not fair to the solvers I don't know I have met the NVidia guys at quakecon and they are pretty good guys Nvidia and EVGA give out tons of stuff I suspect some BYOC sales go to cover that but not nearly all of it Nvidia maybe have just not announced the winners but still given out prizes Maybe they have a reason for it I really doubt its purely to Fuck with people I would Nicely ask Tom if he has any info about the winners Although they have CES in like days so I would expect a response in maybe weeks https blogs nvidia com blog author tom petersen Clay Causin is another

huge King James I had my sisters BOM Bible combo I read it from front to back as to not take anything out of context and used a highlighter and pen to make notes The inconsistencies were incredible and all the misogyny absolutely disgusting I got to the New Testament that is known for being so much better and it wasn't in fact that's where the instructions about beating slaves is And Jesus was a racist and bigot And then it just dawned on me that all religion is shit and I became a an Atheist Humanist I'm interested Getting the Vive in about a week so I'm super excited removed This is the

netflix and rated it quite a lot I'd never put any amount of oil on my brushes or sponges personally One it's a breading ground for bacteria and two just oils from your face can cause 'hard pan' where the top layer becomes hard and unusable The only way to fix it is scrape the layer off which is a huge waste This sounds like its just asking for a bunch of hard pan I'm sure they will be fine they

totally agree with you on that one I should get back into fooling around with the Custom Weapons plugin I have on my non active dedicated server I should toy around with a movement speed gimmick maybe see if it's a viable option Again maybe a weapon that can increase overheal amount I dunno I'm gonna have to mess around with that idea when I get the chance Well first off we might need to buff the demoknight loadout just a small bit Don't want it to be too powerful The Loch and Load Maybe It's fine where it is in pubs and maybe HL due to the prevalence of sentries but it seems to be underpowered UP for short in 6s and maybe HL Quickiebomb Launcher I also don't know the status of Same with Scottish Resistance seems both of them are more or less balanced Most of the melee weapons could use a rework of some kind Skullcutter is pretty boring so maybe add some sort of comp focused gimmick to it Possibly revert the Clad the Cla goddammit I don't know how to spell that sword Anyway possibly revert that sword's stats to having a larger charge duration so that it becomes a viable weapon to at least use in pubs RIP Yeah that's all I can think of Again I haven't gotten into

Iceborn Gauntlet Well that's unfortunate I'd do something like this Iceborn Gauntlet Wondrous item very rare requires attunement While wearing this gauntlet unarmed strikes with the gauntleted hand deal 1d6 bludgeoning and 1d6 cold damage After casting a spell of 1st level or higher your next successful melee attack with the gauntlet causes magical ice to radiate outward from your target in a foot radius This ice creates difficult terrain for all hostile creatures but does not affect creatures that you consider allies The ice lasts until the end of your next turn Additionally while wearing the gauntlet you have resistance to fire damage removed Can confirm Am girl do weird ass workouts They actually work though so judge me Pretty sure he is to drunk to notice Actually By Chile will be

because up until that point commercials before a movie just weren't a thing Now it's a whole schwack of commercials plus previews before the movie I could see movie theatres phasing out in my life time much like drive in movies Most people have good movie watching set ups at home now and dealing with expensive snacks and drinks and the risk of screaming kids movie talkers or butt helmets on cell phones ruining the experience many of us would prefer to watch movies at home Khris has the freshest goddamn sport coats but that would be unfair A level player at arena would be stuck there forever only for lack of skill If someone has the same amount of trophies as you should YES win and lose the same ammount of trophies as you no matter the level This matchmaking is broken thing is no more than an excuse If the guy is at the same trophy range as you it means that he loses and wins to about the same opponents as you which means it is COMPLETELY right for you to face him And if he

registry for a store and I had a client with the last name Peitos Nope I'm just tired of the overall whining in the community about game balance issues Seems like someone is always complaining about how his or that needs a nerf or how they wish something was needed and they don't like it I've been a gamer since games were born I just wish gamers in general would grow up a little Also as I've said numerous times Nobody ever stops to REALLY think about how massive an undertaking something like Destiny is The human factors such as staffing how many moving parts there are what that entails in terms of running a business and what headaches come with trying to keep everyone happy and having wait for it FUN It's a living thing and it's on a truly monstrous scale It's not easy Everyone should lighten up a bit and cut Bungie some slack That's a good thing if you're team tank Deserving is a highly subjective thing also to the point of being bloody useless if you're throwing out the populist vote it just devolves into a nostalgia goggle war I mean you could legitimately argue AoE2 for a strong test of time game but objectively as possible I'd have to say that Tetris is probably the undisputed winner in that category Though if you had to limit it to a single incarnation of a game for me it would be UFO Enemy Unknown x com I've been playing that game every other year at least for

probably more in the intervention I notice literally no difference People focus so much on the technology that defined your childhood when discussing which generation you belong too In Australia we have a Generation Y which overlaps Gen X and millennials I happily identify with Gen Y I don't identify with X or millennials My boyfriend is only years younger than me so we're from the same generation But his family is several social classes above me and grew up in urban UK while I grew up in rural Australia We compared how old we were when certain technology came into the house He was born with a PC in the house I was in my third year of school when dad bought one He was when they got the Internet at home dial up and when they got broadband I was when we got dial up and we never for broadband until I moved out at into an area that had broadband First mobile phone was at for him and for me I was when I got my first smart phone he was From day dot he would use digital encyclopedias to complement assignments I was at the library checking out books until I was and our library got personal use computers with Internet But the city library had computers for a decade I'm years older but I was years behind on tech because of accessibility and affordability Long story short I don't feel like I belong to any generation because people are always talking about technology and how it defines you But it's not just when you were born that shapes your relationship with tech What other measures are there to define a generation Yea but this is the second time he made something sound that way First time shame on us Second time shame on them No ultra balls are on sale Nineteen thousand five hundred forty nine removed I agree That's why I'm not only considering xp

Ice Golem or Ice Spirit Tombestone or Skarmy Fireball Zap Bowler Use bowler as an defensive card and use him as your tank to your graveyard push Never use him as your starting card unless you have to because he's a perfect counter against Elite Barbs and they're so common now you have to expect them like every game Archers These girls can be used when your opponent drops a Skarmy or Graveyard You can also do Ice Golem Archers to kill Elite barbs Most likely you will be using them on defense like the bowler Mega Minion The Mega Minion can be used as an supporting troop to the bowler He's pretty much your tank killer Ice Golem Ice Spirit If you're lucky enough to get a good enough cycle you'll find your self playing a Ice Golem Ice Spirit and Graveyard The Golem tanks enough for your Graveyard to take out the tower if your enemy does not respond to the skellies appropriately The Ice Spirit kind behaves as an mini freeze if it gets to the enemies tower You put down your graveyard first then wait about half a second then place your Ice Spirit Tombestone Skarmy Everybody knows how use tombestone I hope so maybe Well Skarmy on the other hand can act as a zap bait When your Graveyard start to overwhelm your enemy if they have nothing to play they usually zap your Graveyard skellies Fireball You don't want to do this at first usually but when you play your Graveyard your opponent might play a troop that might seem Fireball worthy but really you're over committing You want to Fireball when you know the troop you Fireballed will die You don't want them to use them to counter push Zap Same thing I said about Fireball goes for Zap I legit lost pages via the APP put in a ticket and was told there was nothing they could do Get fucked She is presiding over the biggest

generator They're obnoxious I doubt the advertisers would pay anything close to a significant percentage of the price of a ticket for them Quit comparing yourself to others That really is the start Everybody has had a different hand dealt to them You need to stop wishing you had someone else's and learn to play yours the best you can I'm a few years younger than you but my life sounds pretty similar to yours I'd say I'm relatively decent looking I work out play sports etc I was and at times still am rather unhappy with my life It boils down to measuring yourself in comparison to others You're choosing to the see the positives in their lives while ignoring the positives in your own Keep your chin up and realize that 'life' doesn't happen overnight It's not about the destination but rather the journey Make the best decisions you can for you and don't be afraid of change A fix all doesn't exist you have to go out and make the changes you want Yes that sounded rather tumblr'y I

No And I say no for various reasons Smite is a MOBA who's main selling point besides mythology incorporated and the third person POV is multiple gamemodes You aren't forced to play a 5v5 game mode if you are interested in the game but want to play it casually Duel serves it's niche as a gamemode that you can actually outplay your opponent and be rewarded because of it instead of losing because the opposing team has a better team comp or several better players There are high tier gods for every gamemode and ridiculing Duel because of it is absurd Those high tier gods are countered by gods in similar tiers and even lower tiers Duel also exists as an alternate method of obtaining the end of season ranked rewards if players cannot commit fully to playing Ranked Conquest or finding consist players to party with in Ranked Joust Lastly who is affected by Duel's existence No one is being impacted negatively by it and if players dislike the mode they can simply not play it Removing the mode

you are talking about before you got to this screen or the glowing bubble during this screen it's because they changed to server side loading for these images a bit ago But posting an image of a

disappear Well then good luck Yes All you have to do is get a matching thread and patch it You can use something off color to make it appear distressed Or you can just sew up the hole I'd show you how if I were there but there are tutorials on YouTube I even have had to alter my denim to fit me when I lost weight This is relatively easy to do I just used YouTube tutorials Yeah you're right we should've just waited for Hitler's corpse to reanimate so we could've voted for him Resetting all settings seems to have fixed it i should accept their insurance company and whatever is left sue them NO That's exactly what you DON'T do Normally you sue the driver You have no relationship whatsoever to their insurance company They have insurance so that the insurance company will I presume pay for their defense and if you win will pay you whatever you win up to the limit of the policy If the policy doesn't cover the full amount then you will have already sued and won for the balance and can take whatever legal remedy is appropriate garnishment seizure whatever The insurance company will likely offer to settle If you think their offer is fair accept it and that's all there is to the matter Otherwise reject the offer or make a counteroffer I'm pretty sure it's usually either a case of just not understanding that people can have different preferences I had it out with a friend of mine once that no I really don't like spicy foods And if people can have such a hard time grasping that concept it's no wonder that they don't understand bigger differences or it's part of a cycle of peer pressure them having kids for whatever reason them not being happy with it convincing themselves they are as a means of coping passing that pressure on because they need the reinforcement to help them stay convinced and live in denial Heaven forbid anyone should break that paper thin illusion for them by being happily without kids and thus provide evidence that making more babies is not the only way to go Then they'd have to confront the reality of their own regrets and unhappiness I'm not even being sarcastic it must really suck to be stuck with kids and in denial that they're okay with it because society holds baby production up on a sacred pedestal I'm an atheist and have never watched cosmos and I don't care to google it Give me a rundown removed Wardeccers are just as canercous

then I feel like machine guns kill just as fast Your state of residence is still important Different SOLs for different places If it's four years for the SOL and some places are and you're correct about the date of first default of then finding a payment record could be vitally important as the suit may be beyond the SOL for filing Being outside the SOL is not a protection it's an affirmative defense you still need to file an answer with the court or it'll default against you Now just to be clear the court date has not happened yet right Comedies are always a good choice though I'd be impressed as hell if a girl suggested Blade Runner or The Thing or some other classic scifi movie That's just my preference though I definitely agree you should never underestimate an opponent What I will say if Canadian Drumpflets try and bring their hateful act to Canada me and millions of other Canadians will be waiting to confront them both online and off Online I will stand up to them on Reddit Twitter comment sections etc And offline I'll fight them and their hate in the streets at school work on the subway etc Anywhere these Drumpf following traitors think they can get away preaching hate against Muslims LGBTQIA women immigrants etc they are going to have to deal with an army of Canadians willing to stand up to them and defend our fundamental values of tolerance diversity and multiculturalism Yes you Mos cow now removed pretty happy with that effort plus a clean sheet going into the new year on the right foot My rule of thumb for static holds is that if I can hold it for seconds it is time to make it more difficult by adding weight This is a pain to do with normal planks unless you have plates Side planks are pretty easy to add weight to Just rest a dumbbell on your side it gives you additional incentive to hold still I also strongly recommend you look into the hollow hold https www youtube com watch v LlDNef Ztsc It probably wins the award for simplest looking hard exercise ever I have actually found it to be more beneficial than planks if we can get male king arthur in F GO i believe we can get this dimension's musashi just wait and hope Wow what an insanely naive post Tru tru That's not too bad a building that knocks back units It's kind of like a re usable log Tainted anal blood has affected your thinks kale's where it's at Hey that guy just murdered someone It's okay he admitted he was an assassin first Carry on then There are no ultra balls on sale and paying just to buy great balls is a disgustingly terrible decision I can't do too much because I puke if the dose is too high or I get zero or negative effects if I dose all day long So I kinda have no choice If I want it to work I have to be very aware of how much and when I use it Putin a stop to it eh comrade She's still alive I've moved to the other side of the country and we rarely speak An occasional text at most It was actually incredibly easy to pretty much cut her out because she doesn't make any real effort to contact me either My husband's family live in the same town as her and when we visited I would try and reach out to see her but even if we're there for a week or two I would only see her once for about an hour at most She doesn't seem too interested in seeing me or her grandchildren so I gave up trying I'll tell her I'm in town just in case we run into each other but that's it What kills me tho is that my children won't have a real grandmother Growing up I never met my Dad's parents because they live in another country and my mom's mom was always very mean distant and generally treated me and my sisters as though we were something to be tolerated I learned later it's because she's racist against my dad For a long time I thought the kinds of grandma's you see on tv the loving happy to see you hugging kind of grandma wasn't real But then I met my husband's mom and grandmother They're the kind of mom and grandma I'd always wanted I was so happy that my kids would have them But then years ago his mom died from a long illness We were crushed and now my kids won't have a real grandma either So I've sworn to be the mom I always wanted and to be the grandma I always wanted when they have their own kids I've got a long way to go as the oldest is only so I'm jumping ahead a bit Sorry for the long reply and for practically telling you my life story I just needed to get this off my chest Little depressed I'm alone on New Years for the first time since I can remember All my friends are going to this bar we've been going to fo rthe last years and I can't go due to work I'm also just getting fed up with my coworkers They have some serious flaws in what they do and how they think Shit I noticed right away I've been in this field for years they've been in for at least and can't see the forest through the trees Case in point tonight My main boss wasn't there so I asked his right hand man about a possible schedule change for tomorrow We talked it over and the change isn't happening No problem My boss texts me you need to consult with me about schedule changes You weren't there I wanted to run it by someone why not just run it by the next guy in command SO MUCH MICROMANAGING and lack of confidence in what goes on when he's not around Absolutely brutal and fucking frustrating Ha already knew that myself Also been teated and proven We deserved to lose that game We weren't at the races at all in the second half and rightfully got played off the pitch This kanye must be a clone The real kanye wouldn't do a song with tyga The ELO would make the R3KT even faster by your account Its still faster with less recoil I'm pretty sure vlfph's CP efficiency v4 that I'm using does use the latest changes Zyxwgh's v5 is made just a few days later I haven't had time to analyze the difference between the two Why do you think one is more accurate than the other Problem with that plan is they can raise the price It was fascinating Loved that job but hated the corruption there To the Two great Uncle Earls Well now I've got a friend on here who uses Scratch high fives you but almost screws up but then gets back up and gets it right Not the greatest distance thrower with curveballs so quite a few of mine missed However at least great curve throws several nice and some unlabeled and in the process losing ultraballs and about greatballs and the Charizard still ran Just resolved to only catch Charmanders now hah It'd need a video input that isn't lagging Is Ron Paul woke to the JQ more like pretty

then terrorist cells across NYC would have access to an NK nuke delivered overnight Problem solved I doubt it Typically when starting a new class it will tell you on the creation screen unless I'm misremembering what their primary stats are Even so why I don't necessarily disagree that perhaps there should instead be a 'you should pick this' kinda indicator or some such I still don't see why NOW after years they decided to gut the quest rewards Plus whilst leveling you can use pretty much anything and still succeed to level by the time stats and gear start to really matter it's all you CAN pick MoP onwards anyway Forgot to add the character stats panel also tells you what your ideal primary stats should be It will outright say what each stat does for your class And these days it won't even list those that do nothing for you my rogue is using an int belt right now for RP and int isn't even listed on my attributes From the bar to 225lbs in months is impressive You video any recent PRs I've just started GSLP Phraks version Sounds like it works well for you Shouldn't this be removed for being already photoshopped I've had nothing but good experience from Ulta They'll help you find something that's perfect for you Isn't that the joke What max float should i use I see you use average does it mean i can only use 00x as max or can work too Cot Dayum that looks fire he said something about staying TRUE to the original characters as much as possible Whoa really Trump clearly said in an MSNBC town hall that he would leave it up to the states He also said that is the way gay marriage should have been legalized No legend for the pressure values Ugh Plot twist there are clones of me that comment on all posts across all jailbreak related media I see your point though If I'm getting paid hours to let's say put stock on the shelf and I get it done in hours how come I can't get full hours pay I guess that's the difference between getting paid by the hour and getting paid by the job Same reason places rush to spend their budget at the end of the year The guy in charge will see you didn't use it all so obviously you don't need that much and it gets cut For work they see you do it in and assume all the other times it took were you not working I fucking hate that mentality because the amount of time it takes to do something could change for an infinite amount of reasons Robbie Rotten just wants to be loved he's got my vote Yeah there is nothing wrong with him wanting something you don't There is no moral high ground for you here stop being so condescending

the storm love I go with Goblins Occasionally I play merfolk in Modern because I also love tribal but they play more like a red deck than a blue one Bolt is just the best tho I doubt it was due to childbirth since I'm pretty sure Ruby was already born when Summer left on a mission Yang said it herself that Ruby somehow knew their mom was gone but didn't fully understand what it meant Not at all surprising since they are the only two western games on that list and number and on the list It may be interesting that the vita version of Minecraft is on that list You know what's really sickening Their disgust at interracial marriage and advocation of the objectification of women It may be heavy but then again there are a lot heavier guns out there it has great long range and a lot of firepower It can hold rounds in a standard magazine and you can get many other extended magazines with even more ammunitiom capacity this is a very opinionated question you do not need select fire but it is there if you really need it ELI5 Title That's good to hear I have pretty much the same rig but a and I'd like to play this game sometime soon How bad of dips are we talking anyway Thanks In

risen for more than hours consult a White Mage I think they are a brilliant idea for children with ADHD or for parents who themselves are bad at paying attention In the latter cases I know the argument can and will be made that the parents themselves should do better at watching their kids But this isn't always possible such as the parent also having ADD ADHD and in the end I'd rather have the kids be safe Now im pretty sure this conversation has been going on for years and years also she sings half the chorus in a different language and is the style of her music she grew up on dancehall so at least it's something different that than the poppy edm that has been popular recently So far I've played all tier BBs except the Amagi will try her soon and I'm currently enjoying the NorthCal most When I'm in a BB I want to sink ships with my main guns and the Bismarck's main guns just seem lacking Found the floaty shells of the NC quite bad at first but now I really like her The storm of secondaries from Bismarck combined with hydro and tankiness is nice too but itsometimes causes me to overextend get focused and die or get into scraps with well played DDs and eat torps I'm starting to wish I'd never bought my Tirpitz though Secondary range is meh the main guns are meh to bad and the torpedos have become rather situational now that everyone but the most braindead tomato knows that you have them Looking forward to the Amagi and maybe the Alabama Tier is a good tier for BBs as long as you don't see too many Yamatos I haven't eaten ALL YEAR Recroom Do anything we can to

Before you make up your mind about a laptop there is few things I would like to share First you need to keep an eye of what kind of display output does a laptop provide since all laptops have their own display you want to make sure the laptop you buy is capable of 4K output My Vive didn't work on HDMI out it worked on the mini display port Second thing you need to watch is USB ports and how they are internal connected to the laptop motherboard USB have a very limited number of devices to be attached or you will end up getting the following error Intel USB 3 0 eXtensible Host Controller Exceeded Number of Supported Devices Laptop internally connect a lot of devices on same USB hub web cam sounds card etc This limited the amount of devices you connect to your laptop specially if your willing to connect external devices like printer or external mouse Also does not account for civilians that were in the millitary at I have a hard time believing the histogram for military years ago

Apparently in RE2 when RE2 Spoiler s Ada falls over the balcony I was absolutely hysterical I was inconsolable for days Most recently though the only game that has made me properly cry is Beyond Two Souls The end that game set me off three separate times I shed a little tear at Red Dead Redemption Life is Strange and my second play through of frickin Journey I have little hope for myself when I finally get around to The Walking Dead and TLOU Triplicate Girl I think we have her in our HR department Can we please stop hating on Harper and focus on the real douchebag on the Nats Jayson Werth

can easily sue him I know the concept of suing family seems shitty but kicking you out and firing you is way shittier That all being said it is still best to wait till you have a solid plan in place what even the fuck Well you nailed the plan for the Oakland Athletics from Those great Major League players like Vogt Donaldson Moss and Reddick came outta no where With the exception of Russell those teams had no farm system and we were worse off than the Angels and Mariners Then Beane tried to go for it in and by midseason Forst and co Realized a partial rebuild as full as we could get without going bankrupt was manditory Which explains the Rich Hill Reddick deal the Zobrist deal etc Attu is actually further away from mainland Alaska and farther away from the 180th Meridian so it is easy of the 180th but not as close to it as Semisophochnoi there is absolutely no combination of words that could make up the definition of cultural marxism as you understand it that would make it an answer to the question I asked just to humor you I'm aware of your position on diversity multiculturalism and how some people want to bring it about to the detriment of western civilization and culture however my question still hasn't been answered at least not by you Good luck bud Happy new year Any celebrities died yet Where's the guy with Oberons But that's been Sun's stance on the WF since his introduction Go back to Vol he refers to them as holier than though creeps who use force to get whatever they want and nothing up to this point has proved him wrong So you're saying a Comcast exec just had a spontaneous orgasm then You mean must of been about years since i last saw it Also having never owned it My girlfriend has always liked hip hop and we've been able to put each other on a bunch of artists Her latest favorite is Isaiah Rashad She also made me a dope painting of Kanye for my birthday so there's that lol likewise health and prosperity for everyone Old FWD designs like the original MK1 VWs have it in spades and it's not so much the power as it things like unequal length driveshafts weight distribution the differential the lack of active controls like ESC and what not My GTI had a straight up full analog differential and would spin the left wheel like mad do wheel hop under full acceleration and would turn harder to the right because the left front wheel had more power The right driveshaft on a MK1 VW is almost twice the length of the left In theory it would have been easy to correct by having equal length driveshafts and a centered transaxle like Subaru but in an economy car with an offset transaxle like the Rabbit Golf that wasn't going to happen This wouldn't have fixed the understeer but would have gotten rid of the squirelliness of the platform In spite of this I still loved that car though it was so much fun to drive Everything was analog and directly connected to the driver and you could feel everything going on with the steering input and

me of the days of Wrath There's so much to do the story is amazing It's just a great upgrade in almost every way I'm a casual player and I guess some of the more elite players will find some stuff to nit pick but for me it's everything I could ask for in an expac I really do love the focus on each class this expansion I finally feel like a TRUE paladin fighting with the Light as my armour and

worlds but if the players are completely in the dark it may not make as much sense and if they don't have the right facts they may not ask the questions that you expect Simple things like if the player wants to be the son of a noble then your going to have to know how those the 'nobles' interact with eachother is it a hereditary title or is it based on merit Does your world tend towards peace or violence and if so why What place do magical creatures have in your world are they dominate or are they in decline What is info that you think your players need to know before they start rolling dice are some races shunned Are some locations more dangerous than others What makes this place a good place for adventurers to find themselves in and what are some things that you don't want the players to know or rather what would you like them to discover Well good thing I bought quartz for the new year gacha ahead of time then Ya it is really stupid how you can't put the guys you want out

I'll want to run five attackers at some point and I already have a ton of capable katana friendly units leveled The setup's there even if I never draw anything decent again This is some serious first world decisionmaking but it's still worth talking through for perspective's sake tbh given Blizzard's previous hamfisted story arcs I fully expect them to mash everything together and have the Light

been following FNAF since the very start but I didn't really have any friends that were into it and I couldn't really discuss it as much as I wanted to I felt bad drawing it too since I hadn't drawn much fanart before it they were suddenly taking over my page and I was worried about what people would think about it But man the sub has been great I've been making a lot of friends developing my art style and I genuinely feel part of a community which is a feeling I love and haven't had since So yeah The FNAF artwork in there means a lot to me and I just wanted to share that here Thank you r

UltimateA aron would like it It addresses how evolution works by showing what evolutionary theory predicts and what evidence we find when we go out and look for it It doesn't however try to neccesarily debunk creationist claims Edit this deals with whale evolution which is interesting because of how many different scientific disciplines are needed to fully understand the evolution of whales Whales also have LOTS of fossils and vistegial organs which means lots of evidence for past evolution have been left behind https m youtube com watch v nBpdHVM1Sb8 Take better care of my hair

mother may have been less than half jewish but still thought she was fully jewish Many jews are like that And it is enough to make them jews in our eyes because they support jewry If you are under jewish genetically and oppose jewry and support white nationalism then you are one of us Get a DNA test I don't like to refer to NatSoc germany because it can come across as LARPy but even there jews genetically who were not jewish in practice or allegiance were allowed citizenship and were left alone They werent considered aryans racially but they werent considered enemies either All of it Me too

bother me They were in meme format But they weren't Meme format is this post with an image representing something a meme and text Those were data filled images following a trend on the subreddit Happy new year Instantly our cat exploded into a furball and started jumping everywhere Im playing a paladin that pays homage to pelor the sun God He's very similar to solaire from dark souls I followed the nature path The other characters work well with me since I'm kinda the leader But we've had some problems with killing werewolves but that's it I've had to kinda work with my other players that became a demon but we were friends before hand so I was able to overcome that It's a fun character to play a lot of spell and healing abilities Would definitely recommend And even that was an HD re release that's cool but i hate that a ton of meaningful progression is behind it if it was just left as a risk reward thing with high drop rates or something it'd be fine but gating ascendancy behind it feels bad Looks cool for the large scale battles Keeping an eye out for it The way that it is worded in the Civlopedia it should but it really only gives the river bonus once even near or more rivers Maybe it's a bug or maybe it's worded wrong in the Civlopedia Hopefully they fix it soon I just need the regionals and Magby to catch up Good job Yep people do things they like and expect jobs Others do things the don't necessarily like to get a job Part of choosing a degree is knowing whether there are job opportunities afterwards Depending on where you live those no job opportunity degrees might

you are making as many excuses as possible to not use your frontal lobe Disagree with the ost argument it's incredible I listen to it multiple times a day My biggest nitpick is the loading times when

deals with chocobos something people actually care about in a FF game Others are pretty cool like the end game legendary weapons hunts I'm ok with the hunts in general just because the combat is fun as hell I enjoyed the dungeons but the sealed doors were definitely a let down Was hoping for more stuff to explore instead of a room horde mode I think they could've benefited from putting a scroll menu during battle for techs magic flasks and weapons I was def salty about ng Pretty much no incentive to do it for me personally as like you said the game is too easy as it is Very nice post it's a solid for me too and I'm excited to see how they tweak it and how the dlc turns out Also Happy New Year D Who fucking cares If he wants to sell his stuff off more power to him if he cashed out and still feels the need to post here then he obviously cares about the game or this sub He obviously didn't go through RSI for a refund so throttle the fuck down Isn't Frost's gun known for having good

be an inconvenience but in all seriousness that's a bummer He has most of his combat back it's just that he still has a bunch of stumble around animations You're right I've had encounters where I'm

that have been tested and you'll be fine Stop stealing homestuck memes or I'll either shank you or shake your hand removed I think attraction is just a more situational thing in general Like I find some black chicks attractive and many unattractive I find some white chicks attractive and many unattractive I find some Asian chicks attractive and many unattractive And so on and so on for as specifically as you want to classify people Having those high rise 90's fitness hip hop video hips the ability to do that cute scrunchy nose thing and having a more expressive face in general matter a lot more to me than a woman's skin tone Visual attractiveness is more about how a bunch of randomly assigned features come together and whether or not that works for you That being said and not to get to eugenic but as someone who grew up as a red headed roofer in a never ending war with the angry daystar I'd be lying if I said the idea of my future kids having a shit ton of melanin isn't something that I dream about from time to time A way to really know how good players are would be If supercell add average number of wins in challenges in last 3 months for example people improve their gameplay over time Then we could do a survey on that number ONLY for people who have at least tournament standard level cards for more than months Some people like me try wierd decks in tourneys Challenges are more reliable since people have to spend gems Yeah microclimates are definitely a thing Sometimes a great one None Lmao I'm only able to play jungle I don't exactly know how to do what a jungler does in other roles I jungle with Arachne things are really wrong with me Please bulls win OH MY DOG Dragon's Dogma did such a phenomenal job in terms of combat Did it really It had some other good ideas and atleast trying a real time action combat system is commendable for a Japanese game but the implementation was godawful Even games like dmc could use less hp on enemies to be more fluid more

surface you could say that nuclear force driven decay isn't dependent on space in any meaningful way But for pendants of course you'd then be talking about whether the organization of nuclear forces deep inside is also dependant on space but that we just dont know at that level I mean at some level space and time are inextricably linked together in our 4d space time universe and we dont really know how that linkage works beyond the planck scale So we can only really talk meaningful about that at macroscopic scales and there I think one could safely say nuclear decay gives a measure of time independent of space that's nice Right after my post But I'm glad you linked his instagram mate I definitely expected this Where does the sensor vs stealth mechanics go in Removed because I'll be

does your game time start I'm fairly sure you could buy the game without activating it play the free trial first and then activate the game when the free trial is done If you do that just make sure

Ah okay That makes complete sense Thanks People don't seem to understand that capitalism is a civil war It's consumers versus businesses They will do whatever they can to separate you from your money and they will put as little effort into it as they possibly can They want the most buck for their bang so they give you the bare minimum for what you're willing to pay and then charge a little more somehow As consumers we want the most bang for our buck That puts us at odds with businesses looking to sell us things They aren't our friends They aren't looking to help us out They only want our money Never ever ever take the side of businesses Don't do it They aren't going to take your side They don't want to help you out So don't help them out Seriously Bethesda does not care about you They don't make decisions based on your happiness or well being Everything they do is cold and calculated and serves only to help them turn a profit It's amazing that people are actually saying Bethesda

Fisher a null hypothesis is rejected if the observed data is significantly unlikely if the null hypothesis were TRUE In this case the null hypothesis is rejected and an alternative hypothesis is accepted in its place If the data are consistent with the null hypothesis then the null hypothesis is not rejected i e accepted In neither case is the null hypothesis or its alternative proven the null hypothesis is tested with data and a decision is made based on how likely or unlikely the data is Since biomes and nests exist I wouldn't say it's significantly unlikely to have spawn points

your cooldowns on that You can change classes but you won't be able to accept the duty until you change back Just do it The best way to learn how to tank is by trying it and you know doing hall of the

the way and as some people know we have a years irregular war here with several guerrillas and paramilitary groups as other kind of terrorist groups I used to be part of a combat and spec ops unit the game is intense and is an stress relief the last november was my eight year of retirement and totally understand this post and feel related to it sorry for my english not my native tongue Just an assumption as an electronic module would not fail in thin air lower pressure Not very beginner friendly though The game runs on competition and has no campaign mode Exactly what I was thinking Maybe I'm just not cultured or something but I was put off by the first sentence I genuinely have no idea what you are talking about That probably isn't helping you Don't get me wrong I like high brow writing as much as anyone else with a lick of intellect but the beginning of your summary is not the place to try out poetry especially when for most people it won't make sense Stick with an easy to understand fact for fact format and less of philosopher Maybe save that for a section like I spend a lot of time thinking about And finally PUNCTUATION As some other's have mentioned grammar is hella important There isn't much of an excuse for not taking the time or effort to not capitalize other than laziness which isn't flattering in it's own right It's not that hard and it makes a better

started I've used about Starter spawns are increased from incense but across the board the starter spawn rates aren't dramatically increased So if you're sitting on the couch just catching the that spawn when stationary you have a decent chance of getting no starters Currently I'm getting about in or spawns are starters from incense lures and in the wild I started playing the entire Uncharted series when a bought a PS4 bundled with Uncharted last October I had a lot of fun playing the first three as each one gets progressively better The plot seems kind of repetitive in each of the games  They look for treasure then they found out that said treasure could destroy the world spoiler but gameplay wise it was one hell of a thrill ride After beating the first three Uncharted games I've started Uncharted I was blown away by this game The visuals are amazing the gameplay is intense and the story perfectly concludes the entire series I have never enjoyed a more satisfying ending to a game since Ocarina of Time I was pretty emotional once the credits roll I know this a bigger impact to players who played this series since Uncharted I also played this on HDR mode and this game keeps getting prettier and prettier My time playing the Uncharted games was definitely worth it and I'm so happy that I had a chance to play it As for Uncharted it's a solid game from start to finish and it's why it is my game of the year Heh guess it's improved your dodging Although that Kiev is the 2nd fastest ship in the game by at knots Only the Khab is faster at 43kts Actually star with his own chems gets block shed tackle strength He has higher ratings than Marcel almost across the board When you put him in your lineup he goes up to base Freaking beast and currently the best DT in the game IMO Noob question but can someone please tell me approximately what you get when you do all of these challenges Ie how many coins packs guaranteed players etc thanks He died for our sins we pvp'd on a krab day No problem The values on older NSXs are going up and up If you can want to get in now its a good time to do it Its quite hard for some people to say there average card lvls yesterday I played someone with a lvl tower lvl royal giant lvl barbarians lvl zap lvl musketeer lvl fireball lvl icegolem and some other cards For me its quite easy lvl commons lvl rares except my musketeers they are and lvl ice wiz Manufacturing jobs now are standing hours a day often with a single 30min lunch break You're doing boring tedious soul crushing labor all day and you can't help but think in the next 10 years this job won't exist A machine will be where I am doing the work I'm doing You're paid barely above minimum wage and told you should be happy that you're so lucky to have this job You couldn't find anything that pays like that around here starting out You have to sit through meetings where your manager tells you that unions are bad and useless and that if the minimum wage goes up many of you will lose your jobs What are some of his best verses The only song that has really ever wowed me was Don't Sweat the Technique and I would say that Chuck D Big daddy kane and Ice Cube all have better verses than that Is it legal for her to default on a loan yes It's legal It just opens her up to civil liability which is not illegal This is all great advice I'll add a few things here Try to build the National College in the Philosophy tech as soon as you can You need a Library in all of your cities in order to build it Consider purchasing Libraries for your low production cities to get the NC faster If you're playing BNW make sure you establish a trade route with your capital to get a food bonus If your capital is on the coast use a cargo ship since that will yield a higher food bonus side note always use cargo ships if it's an option because they always have higher yields If you build the cargo ship caravan in your capital you'll have to move it to another city to do this Once they're available I forget the era use spies to steal techs from your rivals It's almost always a good idea to accept a research agreement when offered unless you have to pay a hefty premium which usually means you're ahead of the other civ in tech If you build a city directly next to a mountain tile then later on you'll be able to build an Observatory in that city which grants science in that city Some mountain like natural wonders also enable you to build an Observatory Don't improve banana tiles If you do you get a little more food and production but you'll lose the eventual science bonus from jungle tiles and maybe culture as well if you choose the culture in jungle tiles pantheon yes it does http bp blogspot com Idu01O6G9bg VN0A2kB8mCI AAAAAAAAAEQ fP0fWPuq1X0 s1600 racism jpg Doesn't help that the Canadian dollar is also worthless compared to USD I hate buying stuff online I would buy a year old small car Ford Focus Ford Fiesta Toyota Corolla Honda Accord Honda Fit etc As

doubloons would be nice but already have the TX Good luck people Figures that crooked Hilary would take blood money I think im being sarcastic Edit I'm actually being sarcastic Man piss off Oh I agree about the playing new builds and roles It's one of the best things about this game and why I'm still playing My point was that with them constantly increasing the gearscore it actively discourages that play style because you have to re farm gear for the builds every time they increase the cap Ah yes the rebound in its natural habitat That's like my juice fork stuck in the road if pizza with pineapple or BBQ sauce on it can still be called pizza You have no idea how many people would disagree Some alternatives I've thought of based on your post First variant each player rolls their three and then they bid for a target highest bid up to wins Players then roll their open fourth die and make their keep give call Like Bridge or you need to try and make your target or lose your wager Second variant Like the first except the bidding happens after the open fourth die but before the keep give call Final variant you roll a separate 4d6 and the total is the target number for the round

beating them MTGO is the most complete digital Magic experience since it has an impressively complete rules implementation However it's expensive it has a fairly steep learning curve and it can be buggy to say the least Magic Duels is a stripped down free to play alternative to MTGO It's simpler and more streamlined but the cardpool is much smaller and the rules implementation isn't as complete

probably have to do some digging to find a working version since it's abandonware They already have that casual line the new MacBook It's not priced like a casual line It should be around half the price to really be competitive in the general market It's competitors are ultrabooks that consistently cost less than a grand Yes it's got some nice perks the main one being Mac OS but it's also burdened with a lot of design features that casual users don't really care about at least not enough to justify the premium Apple is charging consumers extra for little other than thinner Same with the new MBP unfortunately There's absolutely no need for a pro laptop to be that light and thin The target user spends much more time using it than carrying it But Apple has compromised usability especially keyboard and battery life in favor of a marginal gain in portability Weird and not a sound strategy in the broad market I would be interested to know what percentage of Mac business at this point is simply driven by platform lock and reluctant upgraders who just need a new Mac because they're due for an upgrade and can't deal with switching platforms I doubt that many people are switching from Windows to Mac for the new machines But I don't know where to get that information I tried once Cant pay attention They do Although dying from it would require you to chew the seeds to make the cyanide available and if you don't you'll just poop them out I don't have the source available but basically the toxicity of amygdalin which breaks down in sugars and some form of cyanide is so that you'd need to eat chew a cup of apple seeds for it to be dangerous While backing in there are no vars in vlose proximity to your car so your visibility is better than when backing out I cannot

Antonidas recruiting for weekend raiding If you're looking for weekend raiding we raid every Saturday and Sundays from about 30PM to 00PM PST We have a solid raiding core of players that work well together and we make great progress for the time we raid but real life has claimed some of our core While pugging is easy enough we prefer a tight knit and reliable group and we're looking for a few good players to round off our roster and raid composition We usually raid with as we prefer a smaller group where everyone's play matters to getting the kill Rapid Succession has been an active guild since the beginning of BC though many of us have played together since Vanilla and we're focused on covering as much content as possible while maintaining a positive but focused environment With experienced raid leadership our raid lead has been doing this since Vanilla we're serious when we need to be and goofy and drunk most of the rest of the time A relatively hardcore raiding guild from Vanilla through Cata consistently in the server top ten and occasionally at the top for entire minutes at a time many of us took a bit of a break after Firelands while a dedicated few held down the fort Now a little older and wiser we've navigated careers kids and international narcotics rings to return back to the fold and are currently a tight knit group of friends enjoying a less time consuming approach to small group raiding We're looking for mature or those that can fake it well dedicated self sufficient skilled members to join the ranks and we're currently especially open to adding a shaman monk heals and some ranged DPS to our regular raiding group skilled committed experienced players with good attitudes and a minimum of salt Unless you're Canadian We have enough of those Too many It's like a maple forest up in here Okay I guess maybe one more wouldn't hurt Balance druids warlocks of any inclination and mages of all flavors are particularly appealing for our

They've been incredibly hamfisted and anvilicious over her character with almost no room for nuance or subtlety and you're acting as if she has split personality Again I want to rest but I will fight because I have to fight is not a contradiction You're insisting that's her character when it's not Even in Volume she was the most proactive against White Fang because she's trying to overcome her cowardice That's the key thing She thinks she's a coward she's bitter about her Semblance and she's trying to take on all of her issues at once because she doesn't want to be a coward Sun had no right to eavesdrop He wasn't like Lemme knock on the door loudly and show her the White Fang mask He wasn't like Lemme wait for her to answer why she left her parents which would give me the time outside to

pretty elitist Your contrasting of Cook at Apple with Nadella at Microsoft is insightful Cook is the immediate successor of Apple's visionary leader Cook is a brilliant executive who concentrates on pragmatism Microsoft also had such a CEO after Gates retired Ballmer Did anybody ever speak highly of Balmer Likely not Why Because like Cook he was the executive successor of a visionary who lacked any vision of his own Nadella is praised because he is also a visionary Cool is reviled because he isn't It's something of a curse every visionary has a faithful executive behind them to make things

we're more emotional since society thinks we're all dainty little flowers I've dealt with more emotionally unstable guys than women being a woman myself Guys seem to bottle things up and become somewhat explosive if we want to go that stereotype route They also tend to latch on hard and don't take rejection well I've been called heartless because I don't express emotion all the time like I'm expected to but I prefer having a logical view of the world over a purely emotional one It might not get all the guys to call me cute since I don't put on an act but it did help me find my SO who has very similar views to mine Value of a degree is defined by the ability to get a job in that field not whether the job itself is ethical altruistic There's lots of degree that are morally valuable but if all the job positions are filled and the market is moving away from that field it's not smart to go into it no matter how just the job is Degrees serve two purposes finding a job and learning interesting things If you enter a field that only serves to teach you interesting things but not get a job afterwards you need to seriously think about your future before continuing I know to me that

It's all about the tasks you're given and the man who handles the paychecks Some tasks have an innate time schedule attached to them meaning task A WILL take about hours Many bosses will pay you the

attorney here Keep fighting the good fight Here's my embarrassing story As a newish associate I had to run to court for an emergency presentation hearing I didn't think to bring a tie or jacket to work that day note ALWAYS keep a spare suit in the office so I got a scarf and tied it like a tie with my rain coat over it The judge looked at me and said slightly puzzled counselor do you even own a tie What's going on here Gesturing at me suit I about died embarrassment I also made the mistake of telling my boss about it and that story still gets told around the office with many laughs I'm the cautionary tale told to every new associate on why you need a spare suit hanging behind your door That's awesome So I don't care about washers but I can't help to be happy for people that are passionate about something anything Good for them I got the version as well that's cool all words are made up the concept is still real in the sense that there are people who believe in racial differences to varying degrees do you consider people of other races to be inherently inferior to yours or no doesn't matter who made the word up or how the word is used now or how nefarious the person who first thought of it is or even how much it matters whether or not someone is a racist if you had read my post more carefully you'd have recognized this I don't care how little you think of the significance of racism First one feels good man the cage on the greens are disgusting Well since you just deny what you can't refute including the idea that human nature would have anything to do with this I guess my arguments are null and I am wrong Maybe mechanic wise but they M L games do not have the charm or the silliness of Mario RPG The Music the art the animations all of it is amazing The only part that's aged poorly is the simplistic combat which got worse in the Paper games And the Paper games are trash from combat to world to pacing Fuck all those games Oh some of us do already but if SJWs turn on white women they'll cease to be useful for anything but crashing the left wing with no survivors Yeah me too I like to focus on just one thing I'm quite surprised by the other replies on here by having multiple things on simultaneously but hey if they can do it then to each their own Truthfully I didn't even try em on I didn't like em after I received them so I bought some

but interesting salvia in a nutshell I don't think I'd recommend it but it's worth trying if it's already on your radar It's really nothing like LSD I can't say whether it's a good idea or not That's an individual choice that isn't ever known until the moment Both are understandable choices and you'll do what's best for you and your family Duke is obviously one of us As I said molyneux seems legit but keep an eye on him The guy is clearly intelligent who knows how deeply subversive he might be I haven't seen any examples of it from him yet that raise concern but just stay vigilant I think that's to prevent people from getting kicked right at the end and not getting any loot but it really sucks that it works in reverse too Never know what you're gonna get with pugs unfortunately Brilliant ad removed Seeing old friends over Christmas and my friend calling me jacked and asking how much I deadlift When I told him he remembered how much I said last year and congratulated me on putting pounds on my deadlift Maybe it's not the best shooter but is the best game all things considered if a few minutes of commercials are enough to keep you away altogether then you can't have enjoyed it that much in the first place I'm old enough to remember when going to a movie was a real event The theaters themselves were architectural works of art and there was a 'respect' for the art of the film Alas now they are junk food selling operations with arcade games and commercials on the side The movie itself is little more than an excuse to sell Coke and popcorn and sell commercials The irony is that the technology of big theatres is better than ever with digital projectors and Dolby sound systems Nonetheless to actually get to the movie requires running a gauntlet of the worst of junk product marketing Movies in my view deserve better than the Cineplex experience Thankfully in some smaller towns mine included there are indepedent rep theatres that are worth going to for a quality movie experience I'm highly doubtful the Switch would be able to run emulated Wii VC games up to Nintendo's rigerous standards As the Wii is a Power architecture based system and the Switch is an Arm based one either the games would need to be emulated or recompiled While most Wii games can be emulated on decently powerful PCs nowadays the Switch is not this The Switch will simply not be powerful enough The Wii games on the Wii U were not emulated they ran directly on the Wii U's hardware as the Wii U's architecture was a Power based one that was very similar to the Wii's I however can see Nintendo recompiling the games for the Switch's architecture and running them like that Just like what Sony and MS do for PS3 games on PSN and select Xbox games on the XBone Life is a meme anyway Something something dankest timeline HWOH Then you played family games in my opinion Has science gone too far Just gonna leave this here Would like to know too So are a thing again im a lady but i appreciate the comment Her and I are still friends as of now but ive been trying to keep my distance Your only option is to start at a community college and support yourself while you work your

multiplier can get in TTDM is or up from a base or I forget which which results in damage at close range with a headshot Still a lot of damage but because it's already a burst at all ranges with one headshot without the attachment it's redundant Third behind Porzingis and Kuz I've requested a few refunds in the past for the same issue so they probably think I'm trying to scam them lol Mike Crapbag is a patient man Ha my phone does that too Except it's a so apple doesn't care lol Joe nobody scrapes stickers here If they did they would be banned Lets say i want to refund an MTX can i refund it even after months of use No how do you even come to expect this 0o Also lets say i buy an MTX that goes on sale after X time does it matter how much time has passed or not for me to get a refund Usually 24h at least thats my experience with such cases Reasons i ask is because i just bought the arctic bubble effect for 250 points and I'd like to be able to refund it if it goes on sale so i can rebuy it for less Well then ask for a refund now because i doubt you get one in month when it goes on sale I've had a black friend say similar and make an interesting case for it But it's the start of a conversation not the end of one You're a fledgling in his 20s probably younger just as I am the only difference is I'm past my lol okay kid phase And I'm not gonna lie If you are older than

Feminist Agenda apparently got good sales it contained Mockingbird and New Avengers and they were right I dunno why people say the game isn't worth full price The game looks better than anything out at the time and even today on the PS4 That takes time skill effort and a lot of money to do Many games look half as good but play twice as long so it really evens out for those who like really good looking games For to be double the length would have cost more to make and not feasible to change for dollars I'm not saying the game is flawless but just pointing out the length being tied to the

turns out many substances can inflict the sort of cellular harm that can lead to cancer behavior Remember it just takes one fluke and you have a whole lot of cells that are constantly fighting to stay alive Even the sun causes damage Even oxygen does If you look at how many people die from cancer especially in old age it becomes obvious that cancer is often a numbers game The longer you live the more chemical reactions have gone on in your body including basic ones like sunburn This means more chances for a few cells to go rogue In the end everyone fails that die roll someday if something else doesn't kill you first Plenty of things cause good results to encounter The trick is moderation Sunlight causes our cells to make vitamin D Omega fatty acids promote healthy skin and hair Many

Warframe with a cyst that can be spread to other players' Warframes through contact The only way to get rid of the cyst at the moment is to turn it into a pet which requires a stasis slot and Kubrow egg and can only be done a week after contracting it Furthermore draining the cyst doesn't seem to give your Warframes immunity so you can potentially get reinfected infinitely Since the cyst is bright pink it tends to clash with most people's color schemes You have a good point about titans but there's meta titan Tone Devs wanted to stop players from using the same thing and made titan which is much stronger than the others The goal should always be procreation Either your energy will be sapped from loneliness into nothingness until you die or you transfer the draining energy into a mini

Fallen but that game had other issues Nothing that's really gotten popular or broken out outside of PC And Dark Souls is such an intricate game they can change seemingly minor aspects of gameplay but those changes still have a big impact on gameplay Fans usually recognize the changes Plus I don't think fans really want any big changes right now we're happy with more of the same as long as the designs stay good As a safety feature The very first automatic transmission GM's Hydra Matic used a shift quadrant that went N Hi Lo R The selector range was changed to N D L R sometime in the early to mid 1940s It didn't have 'Park' until later The problem with this arrangement was that if you were in Drive and wanted to switch to Low but went just a little too far you'd end up in Reverse which could destroy the transmission In Ford released their Ford O Matic transmission which was as far as I know the first automatic transmission to use P R N D L or rather P R N Dr Lo The idea is that it's safer if you've got Reverse and Drive separated by Neutral This has been a Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard FMVSS since the mid 1960s MrGoldenMut has to be one that's copypasta dude and it looks

works I think you're misinterpreting a pocket audience's opinions to the entire audience for anime Outside of its existence on Crunchyroll and posts on Reddit I wouldn't even know that it existed meanwhile Re Zero is constantly everywhere in anime gaming etc Possibly But while it didn't get a lot of coverage on Reddit and coverage in some of the more mainstream anime forums may not have been high it was certainly huge in other areas In the Crunchyroll awards Re Zero has two nominations but YoI has five It topped the annual poll on Anime News Network and was picked in the five top anime by out of the reviewers and topped their rankings with Re Zero fourth And it was certainly much bigger on Twitter and Tumblr that Re Zero It may be that Re Zero was the most popular which certainly wouldn't upset me But it might be the case that YoI's popularity was with a different audience than those on Reddit and it isn't clear if that different audience is bigger or smaller I wish we had access to viewing figures for all the episodes Perhaps the issue is that internationally the numbers of dedicated anime fans are still small enough that a popular niche show that grabs an audience outside of that group can gain greater popularity overall Yeah you can They only stop selling them today but they will probably be in store a while longer They can be redeemed until March 31st removed

the stops to stock up on enough potions just for one day's worth of battles So of course we get overloaded with Pokeballs each time We have been throwing away great balls recently too I would go with SGT CoS is very endurance based with no shops so what you find is what you find However that is also pretty cool from an RP perspective If you have some Clerics and paladins it will be more than

Canada could this be the yearly ddos Pokemon red and blue are years old but they're outdated and broken when you take off nostalgia glasses Much like TF2 I love the combat Before this game came out I

but from what I can tell Xbow is more like beatdown on you side of the field while Mortar is like hog rider With mortar you have to learn when to let go especially as it is only elixir and hits makes it already worthwhile If you opponent uses hog rider a mortar in the center at the river hits the tower and counters the hog for an even trade I actually only started using Mortar about a month ago because I thought it looked super different and underused but because I've used it in every one of my decks during that time I have grown to be quite good at using it and even beat over leveled RGs on

like this GELUKKIG NIEUWJAAR I have but it really just doesn't work that way for my job and I know it sounds like just an excuse But I'm a frontline operator at a call center with some employees that's actually part of a huge national nonprofit I do one thing all day long take calls That's it I don't have any other tasks or projects to work on during my work day or week I talked to my supervisor during our first meeting about how I wanted to do the projects working in other departments for short periods of time being a training assistant stuff like that that do come up but he told me I needed a lot more tenure than I do now to even apply for them So you've given me a good bit to think about truly but I'm just in a weird position where most career advice doesn't apply Isn't what

action was performed automatically Please contact the moderators of this subreddit message compose to r Infinitewarfare if you have any questions or concerns Beautiful Your eye shadows are blended perfectly i'm not gettin' the joke no its a Dodixie annual tradition Just beat the game so I'll chime in too I really liked the game and went in expecting the worst I played FFXIII all the way through while drinking and having me and my roomates riff the entire time I should've expected this would've been better since FFXIV is transcendental Better to be pleasantly surprised though The biggest issue I have with this game is its lack of musical identity Different strokes I suppose I liked the soundtrack though it was far more sparse and subtle than any other FF to date There are very few tracks that switch between styles depending on the situation which requires a different approach to scoring I think with the game's open world nature if they went to the usual one basic track on repeat ad nauseum the repetition would become quickly apparent Normally SE scores per scene but in an open world RPG aside from the scenes that make up the final third of the game you will experience repeated music more often I agree the Chocobo track got really annoying really quickly It could've done with more improvisation and alternate takes I think there's only the one violin solo mid way through they could've had four or five solo's and randomly threaded them into the song after a certain point Fishing feels unfinished and It's just not fun Fishing blows I never really got the hang of it and I didn't pre order the game until a few weeks before release so I never got all the game breaking extras that makes fishing pointless I could see where they were going with it but it's so pointless unfun and missing pieces It would've been better if Noctis' hobby was a card game like in previous FF titles That would've been easier to produce and stayed closer to FF games of the past imo Photography could have been amazing how about letting Noctis point and shoot with a reticle Actually I really liked photography I didn't need to nor did I want to move the camera myself And after around level Prompto's photography gets a lot better I was seeing more and more shots that actually looked good and were funny On top of that I never headed out of a town at dusk I was usually pulling in So I was always asked in the early morning to pull over for a shot never ever at night Maybe you just had a bad run of it I think the focus on photography added to the game for me and I was expecting it to be pointless It's not as if Prompto or Gladiolus' secondary abilities mattered too much more either Most of the tech abilities will never be used Ignis has the most useable and Gladio deals the most power but Prompto even as a support character is awful and underused I didn't put too many points into the Tech abilities but Prompto's Starshell helps out considerably in the end game when there are daemons every god damn were Starshell then attack daemons from behind for extra damage Or Starshell plus the ring ability that voips enemies away I found one of the most frustrating things about this game was the inability to swap between magic tech abilities while in battle Honestly magic should've been taken out entirely or re imagined In essence they're elemental grenades that you need to use as openers or closers I really wish when you used a grenade the AI didn't make Prompto run headlong into a raging fire Manually aiming would be better but the game didn't help when enemies will just run you down at the speed of light anyway As for quick changing why wasn't magic selection handled through the tactical menu Maybe making down on the d pad the magic only option and being able to swap out spells in L2 Easy fix Travel in this game is pretty sloggy and the cars handling mechanics are like being on slippery magnets The car felt really slow getting out of Lestallum for some reason but other than that I found it to be ok I wished there was more banter dialogue or options when driving than there was Honestly I fast traveled each and every time I could only letting the auto drive ride if there was something worth stopping to do between my location and the final destination My bet is that originally you could never manually drive but the option was added in later to make the game feel more like an open world Lets not even go into the loading screens NG is absolutely pointless as it doesn't scale the difficulty whatsoever Yeah you're better off with your end game save dreaming and completing the content Though it feels sorta pointless aside from getting all the things I guess Anyway face Adamantoise It's a bitch This game is too easy It encourages you to sidequest but unless you do every story mission at estimated level you won't get a challenge I guess that's what the Noxperience band is for I didn't mind the lack of challenge since it was never about how hard I was hitting the enemies and how generous questing was to giving me health restoratives Which I appreciated because healing is sorta fiddly The weapons have no enhanceable abilities traits or sockets Vendors had shit for weapons but I appreciated that over the usual FF way of each and every town for some reason has marginally stronger weapons that you are forced to buy The wearpons I found questing were better and I never had to get the end game weapons anyway Didn't even know where to find them Weapons are pointless compared to gear THE BLATANT ANNOYING MMO FETCH QUESTS I went ahead and did just about every quest I could and I think the questing sort of ends at the right spot It was starting to get annoying right around the time when I was seeing less and less to do Now all I have is adamantoise and powering up the weapons with Cid This next point is a large one They seriously need to reprogram how the AI spits their lines out They are downright terrible in repetition and don't even make sense half the time I could go with some code that puts a line on hold for a good hour or so before you hear it again I also really wished there was a conversation continuation system in place Too many times would one character start to say some plot important line when someone else interrupts them because we walked too quickly and Prompto saw a pointless thing to talk about Most of the advanced dungeons are all the same minus the top tier ones which are a grindfest unlike any other It seems like this game really doesn't present a challenge until the very last and when it does it's ridiculous No spoilers but if you make it there you will see I don't know what hard end game dungeons there are other than the sewer dungeon by Insomnia and the one that only opens up at night Guess there are more that are hidden I dunno due to how the game is laid out they were annoying more than challenging Either having monsters constantly curb stomp me or being a drain on my restoratives Why can't I use Aranea or Iris in my party They are coded and work during parts in the game even in NG you can't permanently get them I have a feeling like this is Square waiting to release even more characters as DLC which bothers me Probably because that would require even more banter time and money to produce Imagine the low amount of repeated lines that are already in the game and double it If you've made it this far tell me what some of the things that bothered you while playing this title Bitching aside I think the combat is the most well done part it just needs tweaks I'd say it needs a lot of tweaks Eventually I got it but everything felt too fiddly First off the camera is shit and needs to be scrapped and re programmed from the ground up Enemies need a better system to telegraph attacks and the block needs to be re worked too since half the time the little Square warning sign came up with no follow up enemy attack Warp points need to appear in each and every combat no exception and a cancel animation option would be greatly appreciated I would also re work magic either making it something only Ignis can do or increase the number of spell styles there are Maybe making straight up healing spells debuffs buffs single target multi target etc Also I dunno about you but the MP3 player worked fine for me I could use more variety in towns too Oh yeah and why does Chocobo racing suck Also explain the goddamn story better I know there's a lot of shit going on and it'd be great to see it Also more outfits And outfits for people who didn't buy the game five years before it released Also more scenes like that one time when Prompto opens up to Noctis on the roof of that one town and you really get to know him and his character Why didn't I have that for Ignis or Gladio Ah that's good that it's fixed or hopefully I'm surprised they didn't fix that bug I remember reading about it at launch Oh well I think you might have filled up for real

this up removed 5e So we have an odd campaign we rotate dm's and we have ancestral weapons that make us a bit OP Basically weapons that get bonuses as we level up So my cousin is a warlock and his arcane focus is a part of his sword through time his sword has become He keeps trying to argue that because his sword is his spells sting rolls get to them The sword is does that mean the arcane focus is also He could've picked a materials pouch instead he wouldn't be able to argue the for that He says that dnd is about changing the game to your groups liking but I feel like he's changing the game to benefit himself So now I'm questioning our weapons wondering if his is the most OP of all which I think it is But anyways what are your thoughts on a sword that is giving you to weapon attacks and magic attacks The sword does more I forget what but just that part seems way more op than my rapier that's that I can switch with another weapon for a BA instead of just an action Happy new year So I

fucking infuriating These poeple might be prepared for a minute negotioation to save them some chaos but i don't have the time or the inclination for stupid games The price is there i might be up for

base hence the 45c tag tried to pressure me with invites and spam etc so i told him if he wants the boots they are now 1ex After hours of his guildmates spamming me wtf my gear i sell at MY price he made one of his mates who must be a real sap to do this leave their guild just to come buy them off me Once he had them he spammed me bragging he bought them I got my 45c for my boots i don't think he realised how dumb he looked to me linking them with me knowing the shit he went through to get them at the price i set Dear based blow me gimps Ah yes With new ppl beating the gamr there are bound to

that the community been begging for SRL and Icebreaker Did not require silver to enjoy the full event Looking at you Festival of the Lost this year Surprised us with how fun Strike Scoring ended up being I'm glad for people who like SRL but I personally couldn't care less Played the minimum required to grab the tags and rewards then bailed out maps are not enough physics are unpredictable and sparrows are all the same except two As for the exotics they are horrible imo More examples of rehashing of the existing weapon catalog Nova Mortis and Abaddon are lazy copies that are worse than their arc sibling and will have a really hard time owning their exotic slot The Icebreaker case is a sad one too a once revered exotic that has been so good it was taken out of the game then brought back a year later as a shadow of its former self after countless nerfs and put behind a lazy rng wall I agree completely Strike scoring is a good addition no doubt but I just don't think it changes much in the grand scheme People are paying attention to the scoring in the nightfall only because they are looking for the IB and as soon as they do or lose interest nightfalls will be speed run again or thrown aside Scoring is probably even less impactful in regular heroic strikes as people usually run those for keys chests and exotic engrams All in all I think the Dawning was ok not great but certainly not bad either It's miles ahead of FotL and CD but the bar set by those is too low to consider the Dawning an achievement My personal wish however improbable it may seem would be to make live events target the size of the last April update which had significantly more meat on it imho I never have either I feel like if I want to do something differently in my life or break a habit I

Royal giant with no building I assume you just let the Royal giant help you build up troops behind him then do a big counterpush Cristiano has had a better career than Ronaldo However as a United supporter who loves him Cristiano and has followed his entire career I can confidently say at his peak Ronaldo the Brazilian was the best player I've ever seen I don't think I've ever seen a player as electrifying as he was in his time at Barca and it's a testament to his ability that even after an injury that would have ended the career of many lesser players Ronaldo went on to have a career that can only be classified as world class All that said history will judge Cristiano as the better player due to the longevity and quality of his career I would imagine r politicalhumour would be very one

tears version It was an odd mix of sadness vs party music Liberal spin at work The federal government did in fact say it must be implemented Mr Trudeau essentially told premiers to adopt a carbon tax or cap and trade plan or Ottawa will impose its own levy  a minimum of a tonne by  and return the revenue the provinces http www theglobeandmail com news politics liberals to set carbon price at a tonne in rising to by article32206937 And carbon pricing is not the actual cost It's a cost made up by bureaucrats a cost that is impossible to accurately measure and a drag on the efficiency of the economy and it doesn't reduce emissions But BC Ministry of Finance budget documents show clearly that total demand for the B C carbon taxed products grew faster after the carbon tax was introduced than over almost every other similar timeframe between and before the carbon tax was introduced Further B C s official Fiscal Plan expressly forecasts that in spite of the carbon tax B C demand for the carbon taxed goods will grow another by April while the population is expected to grow only http business financialpost com fp comment carbon pricing doesnt work The most we have ever reduced greenhouse gases is through the Montreal Protocol https en wikipedia org wiki Montreal Protocol in It reduced GHG by more than all the initiatives since combined We need to keep working at behind the scenes solutions like this like the October amendment for HFCs to reduce GHG not feel good sunny ways carbon taxes that have little actual effect Just use a third party like USPS Dyer seems to have stopped at million so I guess he just wanted the milestone prestige Probably if you have the time Exdeath's is enough is better but I'm not exactly an Exdeath master I only have levelled up You're in a pretty good position haha I don't know what to say p Harkon's offer is the branching point of the Dawnguard DLC If you accept you join the Volkihar clan If you decline you end up with the Dawnguard The rest of the DLC plays out pretty similarly you hunt down the same plot trinkets but the details of how and why are a bit different The real difference is the sidequests and magic The vampires sell some necromantic healing spells while the Dawnguard has some special anti undead magic You also get additional opportunities to become a vampire lord later on even if you turn Harkon down but it will also make you persona non grata at the Dawnguard fortress until you cure yourself oh my god this song is like the song that defined me getting into one of my more serious relationships I also really

am on SEA server tho Downvotes may be from selfish ppl who want this post less visible for less competition Have an upvote and bring on the contenders You target what's in your graveyard not what you sacrifice The creature on the board that you are going to sacrifice is not in the graveyard at the time when you're casting victimize I'm actually confused about what you're asking to be honest Because the loose wording that you're giving to sacrifice target which in itself is not actually a thing I am assuming you have abyssal gatekeeper on battlefield and creature A and creature B in the graveyard Target both creature A and B in the graveyard with victimize then victimize resolves and you sacrifice abyssal gatekeeper A and B will be on the battlefield and then abyssal gatekeeper's ability will be put on the stack when that resolves you will be required to sacrifice a creature A and B are creatures you control at that point and you can sacrifice either one of them Usually cant

hellhole it is i know its not but ye know No direct source but before it released there were loads of cards that the community made based around the idea of a inferno tower type troop Taken about Pokestops to amass my collection of ultraballs So yeah not a high drop rate Tonight I got 40ish great balls spinning approximately stops Edit forgot also leveled up in that time and bought two ultra boxes so the ultra ball drop rate is even lower Down the second I logged in and checked Reddit down in US East Coast Down in FL Just picked up my controller got disconnected from IW then got a message

for the lols Watson sure looks hyped I love it when players are having fun like that shower in boos It would be the only time he showers in anything Yeah man good luck Literally just passed new years here so happy to you wherever you are Hope you enjoy the game too ITT people not reading the award description Maybe csgo didn't deserved to win but it totally fits in the category It doesn't mean literally minutes This one is especially stupid because you can place a value on the mods that value being Who the hell would spend on a '98 Taurus Even a brand new one doesn't cost that much That's TRUE would love this as well Love this OP pretty sure the devs will really appreciate your thread as one already did If you ever would like to squad up with me on BF1 on PC Discord and some mates hit

personality to build it's own story lore I'm being lazy and don't want to search to see if someone else mentioned it but your comment about running prey reminded me of it Humans are hands down the best at endurance running we can run longer than anything we are just slow in comparison But I guess you could argue that in our beginning it was better to have endurance than speed since most predators can only keep top speed for a fraction of the time Can't run faster than the thing that eats us but if we can put enough distance then we lived to die another day Sherwood Park residents

chance Also it doesn't have to run the game or video at 4K resolution Just having the display be a high resolution can really increase the way the image looks removed What's your level now vs when you were first chasing starters The best thing about Amagi on high tier matches is that everyone seems to underestimate it for some reason It's actually really tanky when angled well and the guns are fantastic Ships like Montana Iowa and Yamato tend to ignore you because you're only tier 8 and broadside you or angle against something they perceive as more dangerous but Amagi's guns will easily citadel even a Yamato if they broadside She fires enough of a broadside that even an AP salvo will give a lot of Destroyers second thoughts too and her secondaries have fantastic firing arcs forward I think really the only other BBs that give me pause in mine are Izumo and North Carolina because both tend to favor a bow in strategy that can make it difficult to deal with them I've also had a few issues sometimes with taking out Bismarcks and Tirpitzes that decide to angle away from you and retreat but it's probably just that I tend to continue to fire AP when I should be loading HE sometimes God I hate that sub Good bye You're the shit post guy It won't be 'laggy' but you will notice the frame rate is lower Either way fps looks better than so it's still worth having the monitor I'll work

Thank you open So whats the deal with imitating Russian accents then Because that is also not considered racist Optimistic assumption founded in the observation that the majority of the community favors a zero tolerance approach Happy New Year People want it to be TRUE It makes Jean Grey a much more interesting character if it is TRUE Which is why it's probably not because Marvel can't write for shit There's an edit of her fighting Karnak where they make her try to make him gay only for him to flick her in the forehead saying No Jean you're gay Made me chuckle What's wrong with you Granted she was hot so your dogs pile of shit what In yet every one of my friends who like hip hop ask me who the fuck I'm talking about whenever I bring them up It sucks What I've found is that eve lacks what other PvP games offered a chance at fair equally matched fights of fights in eve are about ganking or using a counter to win the fight before it's even started Ganking and this playstyle is encouraged in eve whereas most other MMOs fair fights were considered honorable In other MMOs the character was often equally matched which meant more skill intensive fights as the battle progressed Not so much in eve with no skill cap and things like high end ship mods and boosters I heard the plot is loosely based on Marie Antoinette They're enthusiasts enjoying their Eve how they want to in a perfectly harmless and reasonable way leave them the fuck alone Op is the real cringe for trying to put people down for how they spend their time good read amen brother Sadly it's a scam website I'd buy one in a heartbeat if it were real Yeah I think Charizard is the strongest grass counter in the game while the two fire dogs are the strongest fire types in the game Although Dragonite might be

there is a huge amount of resources available to practice with It's easy to find and talk to a native English speaker compared to a less common one Since you already have access to native speakers

convoluted story but i will do my best to explain I will refer to the grandfather as Jim Jim lost his wife to a stroke years ago and remarried about months ago His new wife Linda is much younger mid 60s She seems very nice and is very charismatic Jim on the other hand is very hard of hearing pretty mentally sharp but otherwise what you would expect of someone in his 80s Jim is also very wealthy his late wife had a large life insurance policy and left Jim everything with nothing going to his children or grandchildren Jim has in turn wrote his entire will including many family artifacts to Linda Since their marriage strange things have happened Jim's grandson was living with him since he is still in college Linda demanded he move out a few months later her year old deadbeat son was able to move in rent free Now that doesnt sound suspicious shitty but whatever Jim is on a a steady dose of medication vital to his health Linda claims to be a natural health nut and tries to stop him from taking his medicine A month after they were in an accident Linda was driving She ran a redlight and rear ended a vehicle going According to Jim he was wearing his seatbelt but it mysteriously became unfastened right before the accident Jim hit his head hard on the windshield and wanted to go to the hospital Linda refused Jims daughter Jamie had his power of attorney and when she got to the scene of the accident was enraged that Linda was trying to keep him from the hospital Jaimie told Jim to go to the hospital and that was that A week later Linda tells Jamie and the whole family that Linda now has power of attorney Jim has not said anything about abuse or anything like that but myself and my GF's famil feel this woman and her son are evil and trying to kill Jim We feel powerless to stop her and powerless to prove anything They are not concerned with the money or the artifacts they just want him to be safe He is oblivious of any wrong doing and thinks she has his best interest at heart Is there anything we can should do tl dr GF's grandfathers Jim new spouse Linda made sure the will be put in her name since then bad things have been happening to Jim Power of attorney got changed to Linda after a suspicious accident We do not know how to help him as he does not feel anything bad is going on We are afraid for his life Wait for sales they happen every three weeks But

a very excellent list Items and ring especially TRUE for me I too was a naive TBM who assumed everyone around me believed the same I did I had no idea how much variance there is even among active Mormons and neither do they The church has a vested interest in not clarifying tough doctrinal or historical questions because people will be shocked to discover nobody has agreed on those questions for decades In addition a common thread I've noticed in almost everyone I've met who has left the church is that the fact that it is FALSE overrides any community or fellowship that membership could provide For me and many exmos like me it is more important to be honest and not pretend lie just to stay in the club For many people who stay however staying in the club is so important they won't even let themselves acknowledge any possibility that it might all be made up I don't think they're dishonest it's just that their affinity for remaining in the group is so strong they cannot even comprehend something that might challenge that Many mormon marriages end up in this same situation Because of the religion he's going to change into an asexual GA clone and when he doesn't he's a

think the Olympic Committee's rules are shit By their standards Fox is perfectly eligible for competition The real problem is that because trans women competing in professional sports is still very rare and heavily stigmatized we actually don't have a good set of data or even basic information that could be used to setup a framework for them to compete Fox's T levels are going to be lower than most of her competitor but there's obviously concerns about bone density and fast twitch muscle response So rather than go All trans women can compete against women Or Dudes can't just wear a skirt and fight women We should be looking at establishing fact based rulings to determine how an increasing community of athletes can fairly compete I was just playing Titanfall and now I'm taking a shit I

you are paying You need to aim well and stomach that even that won't always be rewarded Gneisenau is a ship with a relatively low skill threshold While better players of course do better with it bad players can get decent results with it as well which is why it has the best T7 average stats bar Scharnhorst but premiums usually tend to do a little better because of their player base If you are looking for a T7 ship with a higher skill payoff however you might want to look at the Nagato instead The Gneisenau is a great ship to queue with carriers by the way If you got a friend who has a

shadows On top of all the good high level cards in that deck make it a bit top heavy and can be inconsistent You should play Holo Impact Prologue too same kind of game but way more impressive not very

explanation Have a happy new year Guardian I just beat it I haven't played something so metal in my life Excellent game Who says he won't be hungover the morn except finalcut pro and garageband Well first of all let's not gloss over these Final Cut and Logic Pro are the best video and audio editor applications and they're exclusively for macOS Garageband is a great lite version of Logic Pro and it comes with every Mac for free Office for mac still shitty Doesn't matter I've been using iWork for years and it's better than Office for Windows or Mac Aside from Numbers missing a few advanced features of Excel iWork has everything Office has Pages is much easier to use than Word and Keynote blows PowerPoint out of the water Plus unlike Office iWork is free and comes with free cloud syncing and collaboration Microsoft charges high prices for both Office and Office adobe software is glitchy on mac I use InDesign on my MacBook Pro almost every day and it runs just fine for the most part My few experiences using it on Windows felt the same Blizzard for the 1st time dropped Mac support for their overwatch claiming Apple doesn't care about gamers at all This isn't surprising at all The Mac has never been a great platform for gaming Buy a copy of Windows and install it on your Mac for free using Boot Camp Problem solved There are lots of machines with same build quality Bullshit Better does not mean as good as Apple's You will not find laptops with build quality as fantastic as MacBooks period I see MacBooks that are years old all the time still running fine With most PCs they break down fall apart or have their battery life go to shit within years in areas of performance for pros and interfaces Mac is loosing on all fronts Oh come on are you actually going to claim that Windows is a better interface than macOS It's not the disaster was but macOS is by far the most polished desktop experience Rest in Presents Also I hope your pun is intentional interested in another fire

Happy New Year from the UK May we all see many rainbow crystals in our future It's an extremely minor increase to defense and magic defense at low levels Like maybe points in Sastasha It's nice to have but it's pretty unnoticeable at that level Wow Fine here in FL Been playing some OW before I head out The Herald is pretty limited as far as jobs go All data and no cargo space While your other two ships have plenty of cargo space they are also pretty big and may be expensive to operate at first So unless you're totally set on running data in the Herald it might not be a terrible idea to upgrade I just upgraded my Avenger Titan to a Cutlass today Theres lots of real patterns like Sweden for example ever since they accepted muslim immigrants violent crime rates have been up and rape rates have been up hows that for patterns who gives a fuck if you cheat in a single player game SJWs The outcome of this would that it would be impossible to find a tournament that wasn't full Just search two random letters for example fi and you have a good chance of finding an open tourney He's switched it before Guaranteed If anybody wants to play overwatch with a very drunk me I'm La Vent Dur on Xbox live It's my Birthday today So huh may I have it please I can post the pertinent info online to prove it I'm kinda old at It's always fun cuz I wish people Happy New Year when they wish me Happy Bday Happy New Year guys That would simply add further incentive to run pouches which are in my experience already less team oriented While I know everyone on Reddit keep telling me that they throw pouches to people constantly my experience is that unless one of my friends or I are running medic or supply we simply don't get resupplied or healed even next to support or medics Crates at the

about a low key crisis like a hipster quota directive being launched on April 1st You know the interesting part of ignorance is that it encompasses the term ignore While it is not directly part of the same etymology I've always thought that the two words are pleasantly inter related In your case you are ignorant because you actively choose to ignore In truth of course there's another phrase for that wilfully ignorant The etymology of ignorant is really just to not know Know gno and all that So we should be clear when we use words shouldn't we You are not merely ignorant you are wilfully ignorant http rationalwiki org wiki Willful ignorance It's motivating to me to go to the gym when I've got per session weekly monthly yearly and multi year goals YMMV For me right now I'm definitely not going to stop being super weak unless I go to the gym There's a goal Another better goal would be I'd like to DL plates and bench I'm pretty close but if I don't go to the gym I'll lose progress that I've fought to win so there's no question about whether I'll go or not Well why don't we add more expansion teams and extend each division to teams Judging by the perceived size of the model you'll most likely be stabbin' da booty Im 5'6" When I graduated high school I weighed 120ish lbs i had been so busy doing everything and anything I could at school to earn scholarships My girlfriend had even said I looked emaciated I spent my freshman and sophomore year just putting on weight cause I hated being smaller than my girlfriend When I got to I finally felt human I weighed around that until four years ago When I turned I started lifting I found a passion for it And a connection achieving goals My first goals were simply to add more weight again I wanted to weight Then I could focus on strength and get to my first goal of one day bench pressing 225lbs once You see those guys in the combine repping it out like its nothing I wanted to do it just once This year Ill be turning my bench goal is really cause I want that third plate What Im getting at here is that I too was in your shoes I too was weak skinny and down on my appearance Finding that drive and passion and setting achievable goals has kept me pushing and growing Stick with it and your inner strength grows so too will your muscular strength Original post https www reddit com r AdviceAnimals comments 5lcibi is

which helped ensure I paid all my bills on time and also dramatically lowered my debts to zero Some older missed payments did disappear this year though which affected my score positively Never listened to Tyga other than rack city but I was really feeling this song when I listened to it Ye kinda goes in It's TRUE Christians were persecuted in Japan between the 16th and 17th century some of whom were crucified https en wikipedia org wiki Martyrs of Japan The wrathful jealous and angry Biblical God claimed that he would visit the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and the fourth generation of those who hate me It is also made clear in these texts that vengeance belongs to God not to man So your grandfather is wrong in terms of his reading of the Bible More importantly Christians believe that God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world but in order that the world might be saved through him Further according to Christians Jesus preached forgiveness for those who sinned against us And yet this goes back and forth with many contradictions As atheists we can't make sense of it Good point because other teams' fanbases don't have that cassettes are by far the cheapest and most fun form of music collecting yes they sound like shit but they're just fucking tight new vinyl from an artist new cd from an artist new cassette from an artist when applicable usually around thrift stores have massive boxes of tapes hidden away because literally nobody cares about them you can find hifi decks for less than at the same stores it's the only way to get some flashy futuristic ass gear with crazy design and random sensors that you don't even understand without dropping hundreds of dollars yesterday i picked up the miami vice soundtrack a tape of sailing sounds and a collection of island party music for less than a dollar also your friends' parents will just give you their old collections once they find out you're into tapes it's cheap as dirt oh and i forgot about tape labels they're fucking rad last time i bought a new tape i got a handful of candy four stickers a business card with some cool art on it and a handwritten thank you you can't get that shit anywhere else Just got the same thing two min ago What repo do you use to get tweaks nothing more then repetitive actions over and over for all aspects of the games mechanics You've just described every game ever Including SC because there is very little to do currently Only epic games like EVE GTA5 WoW etc have soooo many different activities that repetition becomes less of an issue SC may have publicly scoped that large but it's many years away until it'll be on the same scale as those games ED has player to player interaction too when the instancing bugs don't mess up thankfully fixed in the current beta and will gain four role multicrew in expected at the end of Winter Group warfare is already active in game with passionate PvP factions not on the scale of EVE of course which is the granddaddy of PvP Yep what're you trying to use redsn0w for with your iPad Pro be careful though if you do what you suggested it'd basically be like sprinkling it directly onto your brain I've banned myself from using ultra balls for non final evolutions and from using greats on anything with less than outstanding cp for this event outstanding being anything higher than my current highest cp over for that individual species I encountered a high level CP Blastoise today which depleted my Ultra Balls so I know I made the right decision there I don't think the starters in the event are any worse than they normally are but is that because my expectations are lower because I'm only using pokeballs The Santachus seem harder to catch than the starters I've stopped bothering with them now Is that car a Vega Javelin Maverick or Comet Happy new year Same as this guy I was not aware That's pretty cool Curious as to why they'd willingly sacrifice one of the few remaining hi sec capitals though Oh definitely agree Was just pointing out that we can still root for our favorite players and teams even if the orgs are shifting around roster stability is one of the biggest pros with the new HGC format Naz for fuck's sake you're going to stay in widot and you're going to like it you hear me The victim's family should sue massively Dying for bacon is not a proportional punishment Finished a curry at Hang in there months is no joke At least you're through the withdrawal stages Think about how much nicer it'll be now when you get your shipment Happy New Year and Happy Anniversary Exact same thing percent I think they're horrible and unnecessary When I was a kid I was taught that I had to stay within eyesight or my mom would alert security the police fbi army navy the air force the president of at least five countries It was a joke as he said that people are playing PS3 PS4 Makeup for TV is usually a bit different from every day makeup I think they use cake makeup at least we use cake make up on stage in theatre You can recreate the look quite well I use Ben Nye cake makeup for the stage but for every day looks I personally start with moisturizer apply a silicone face primer for all day hold a liquid foundation and a fluffy round brush to apply a setting powder in nude I use a brow kit and angled brush to do my brows Then I use the cake Navajo Sand by Ben Nye to put right where the natural shadow starts below my cheek bones and overlay a rose blush just above it I take dark brown Ben Nye shadow to line the outside of my eyes only and finish with a shimmer highlighting powder to go over my cheek bones jawline forehead and nose I make sure I follow the natural shadows and highlights of my face and then finish with mascara on the outside of my eyes It looks pretty natural and the hot girl disguise stays on all day Doom for me I love everything about the game at least the single player The gameplay art direction graphics sound design and music are sublime Honorable mentions Attack on Titan which is fun despite being so simple relatively monotonous though the different playable characters keep it from getting stale too fast and it's pretty easy before you unlock TRUE Attack Mode TRUE Attack Mode makes the game much more difficult and while it still doesn't capture the overall grim tone of the manga and anime it's much closer than anything in Attack Mode DoAX3 for actually being an improvement in terms of the volleyball gameplay and the addition of Owner Mode and Excitement Level makes gifting suits from one girl's collection to another girl less of a timesink compared to XBV and especially X2 X2 would take at least a year to do everything if you devoted your entire spare time to just that game though it is still held back by being a glorified tech demo like the other games in this series and is sorely lacking in terms of activities compared to XBV and especially X2 and while the soundtrack is surprisingly good for being in house stuff it's just not the same without How Crazy Are You Legend of Heroes Trails of Cold Steel for being a solid and fun RPG It's basically more of the same gameplay wise as the first game but better in every way especially since there are more than Divine Knight battles so if you liked the first game you should like this one too Senran Kagura Estival Versus is an improvement in every way over the first game and as a wise man once said Tits are life ass is hometown Valkyrie Drive Bikkhuni is very similar to the Senran Kagura Versus series and I like that series so this was a no brainer for me I'm also having some fun with Dead Rising but they've changed a lot with the game and it's just not as fun as the previous games and the exo suits have too short a duration Edits Formatting added a couple games Everythingapplepros youtube At first I was really confused with the kuva siphon mechanics I was a burden to my teammates because I literally couldn't do shit I couldn't stay in Operator mode for seconds and my dash seemed to be cm it seems that I would aim for some sort of lip in the ground without noticing I'm certain that people that came here and in the forums complaining about leeches I was possibly among said leech Now that I know how to do it it's very simple I learned how to get in and out of Operator mode long enough to disarm the kuva guardians and not get rekt while also keeping an eye out on the kuva clouds Unfortunately you took the words out of my mouth the spawning of the siphon can be very painful Sometimes it spawns in such place where the guardians stay in another floor usually occupied with the mission's factions infested or corpus while you can safely keep an eye out on kuva clouds Most of the times it's in such a tight spot it's hard to look at anything else other than those fat fucks Eris' maps are the greatest culprits of this I forgot how many times I failed a kuva flood because the siphon spawned right on top of a hive and the clouds would appear exactly next to it There was zero time to react and the guardians would murder our operators before we could do anything I don't think it's a terrible farm especially after you get used to it I thought kuva farming for me was done but after a little practice and watching how people do it I can do even the floods on solo perfectly without losing a single cloud However these spawns really need to be checked out Some are ridiculous I'm not fond of emoji pastas in general And that's okay No one ever said it wasn't Calm your tendies DSV boyz in the hood Of course racism being defined as in group preference based on race exists That's what every race of people practice It's only Whites who are expected conditioned gaslighted to not practice racism Hence the racist slur That is the entire objective of the term to keep Whites from practicing in group preference Issues due to really high traffic Everyone is is off from school and work Parties are only just starting everyone is gaming right now I have seen people posting issues all day Still it's a nice enough art style Our Jayson Hobo Jesus Werth insult game is pretty strong In my heart this game is still for all the tostitos I'm missing Hitmonlee so nothing for that Just one of those oddities Took me till to get a Lapras Wow so according a subset of people it's OK to be condescending because they have a vagina try r hockey or StubHub No I'm just someone that appreciates a good movie and not a complete piece of shit Between Smurfs and Rag still dominating QM I am terrified to bring my friend who is new to Mobas out of AI games Is this insight worth a smaller player base Because I think a game with a high Smurf population becomes increasingly exclusive Thanks And basically

the first There's an ongoing investigation and all that too Unless you have particularly complex and technical needs e g trusts or estate planning do not trust or work with anyone you meet in the financial industry who is looking to advise you or manage your money Almost all investment products you hear about are a sham designed to confuse overwhelm retail investors with too many choices to create the FALSE perception that you need a professional to help you navigate this purportedly complex web of products In reality most of these products just go towards generating commissions fees and hidden fees to compensate overpaid workers in the financial industry In general all you need is one ultra low cost equity index fund e g SPY or Vanguard Total Market Return and maybe a small allocation to a similarly low cost bond fund if you are more conservative and the desire to save a little every month Let your assets grow and compound and never sell a single share except to fund a purchase of real estate for you to live in pay for kids college or until after you retire and need the money to live on If you are selling one investment to fund some other investment that someone

yet or it isn't PSN at all i've never had an issue with opening jars either i'm probably strong for a woman but i don't think it has much to do with overall strength as it does grip strength AND SHEER WILLPOWER haha my husband needs help with jars sometimes because he's had hand surgery so that's why i'm thinking grip strength also a trick i learned this on some cooking channel take the jar and slam it upside down on the lid on the counter um make sure your counter is strong enough to take it first opens super easily every time i used to do the tapping around the lid thing but this is faster and more effective from the foreign people who say wen can jailbrK ios iphon pls lol i though i was the only one who loved reading those comments The people that watch your food and guns huh Project

Kittay Would have never guessed she's from that picture and I have kids You need something with more of a pinky tone I can tell from your skin tone on your neck You don't really have a warm enough tone to need a warm foundation Either try a neutral or pink tone you could also mix foundations until you find your perfect match And color match your neck too that's the most accurate way of testing without having to do your whole face everytime Yeah I don't like it either but that is just capitalism unfortunately Sometimes it creates these monopolies or duopolies I don't like it like I said but I'm also not sure I'd call them evil for exploiting it I'd feel awful if I jinxed it I have no affiliation with Cineplex I'm just sick of people whining about movie ticket prices which actually haven't gone up much in like years which I'm surprised people are still bitching about it I remember the tickets went up to like dollars in like when Silvercity was new on the scene They havent even really gone up much since then Is dollars still a lot of money to people I would honestly pay to see Star Wars or Avatar and not even bat an eye It's some epic entertainment experience that's worth every penny I would pay like to see Avatar in 3D IMAX That shit was fucking insane Honestly I think you just need a good idea Personall I'm an aspiring comic creator and from what I've seen there are more than enough people looking for a good comic to read Heck I'm one of them I'd love to read something that didn't occasionally stop to tell me I'm a bad person for not doing more to help trans lesbian orphans I Know I didn't say anything like that White babies are in higher demand in Canada where I live I assume the U S too In addition to damage scaling also think about your loadout If you are getting overrun with enemies in certain missions trying using a fusion rifle and machine gun instead of say a sniper rifle and rocket launcher Obviously you're limited by your weapon choices at this stage in the game but try messing around with things because there is no one loadout that works for ever scenario Also since you're a newer player make sure you're capitalizing on your abilities I've seen some new players treat the game like a pure shooter and never use their supers but you don't need to save it the end of the mission strike etc All of your abilities recharge pretty quickly and will charge much faster when you get better gear so get in the habit of using them a lot And FWIW some of the missions are just hard to play solo By all means play the way you want but know that you will be essentially locked out of a fair amount of activities just from playing solo For example the Nightfall is the weekly strike challenge is definitely something you'll want to do to earn loot but it's designed to be played with a fireteam of Plenty of people do solo it but it's not going to be easy and some weeks nearly impossible I'm not so familiar with American accents beyond the extremely obvious differences What accent's that supposed to be Obama is the problem Apparently they want to talk about gross shit and don't understand that theres nothing interesting about tampons and they're also gross I know its natural and thats fine And I don't care Diarrhea is also natural and talking about that is also gross nty is too low Thank fuck ARK didn't win anything Are you new to the Internet Use the password recovery or use offline mode or use the Vive standalone software If you lost your password and didn't setup the recommended backup system then the problem is you If it makes you feel better to call me a fanboy feel free We don't from home waste either but those bins you see in public schools hospitals etc they do If I were to put the second monitor onto my second

Happy New Year to me Did they actually fix that I remembered it resetting the global cooldown Can the underglow be set to a uniform color I think it's much better than the Thor skin The mothers nurse their young so I'd say mammals Did you follow through r sideload and r sideloaded Sorry You know internet people assume make an ass of myself etc All I want to say is that no I'm not disappointed besides wishing certain characters got a little more screen time but they're restricted on time so hey what're you gonna do Also that tweet you pointed out really has no relevance It's not like the person running their twitter account has any say in the creation of the show it's just some social media person tweeting out random shit I know It irks me a fair bit when this happens because one loses a lot of precision when discussing things especially when contrasting how racist politics were employed by the various different strains of fascism and in this case it actually matters though I'm starting to wonder whether even fascism is applicable here There's so little detail about the administrative practices and political theory of the Galactic Empire that it's a bit muddled whether it is a fascist regime or just a generic authoritarian dictatorship CSGO just more minutes Uh seriously I always thought that was aggresive cancer 'I drove recklessly and with wanton disregard for anyone or anything in my path Because doing on a lane highway that is miles or more that maybe only has one or two people on it at a time during the winter is being reckless wanton disregard You mean the leafs that blew in my path Also the question was but I'm wondering should I just get a lawyer to be safe or try and fight it myself Pretty much yeah It helps you slightly vs cruisers but not much vs BBs i WISH i could curse more I work in customer service so that fucking blows Can't cuss out customers When they aren't around out of coworkers are crazy religious and would piss and moan if i even let a damn slip Fucking cry babies if you ask me But when i'm home the only person i've met who curses more than me is my SO and i love it Uncharted can't remember if earlier ones did it as well

Westworld The Grand Tour season four of Sherlock which airs tomorrow Any build recommendations East US down lol what the fuck man NA Friggin wingdings I haven't read what you just said but I'm drunk and here's my first comment of from the UK xoxoxo Brampton man in Toronto Mans made it I was being elitist though Skyrim is fucking awful and he should feel ashamed for liking it What do you use Rack pulls That's his D That will probably be my next project I would say it becomes useful around Toto rak if you still have a base class tank Brayflox otherwise this Not every ZapBait player mirrors the furnace lol So you just genuinely like re playing the same content for the same gear every patch Cause if you're into that and you really love the mechanics world something about this game then I could see it being a dream having some flimsy reason to replay everything I understand playing to attain the new levels What I'm against is playing the exact same content you have been for the past patches for the new levels There's only so many times you can run Lexington before you really hate Lexington Personally after this patch I was fairly sick of having to cobble all my pieces back together again and if was gonna set me back to having to grind out all my loot for a 4th time playing the same incursions and missions I did for all the previous loot I was probably just gonna not play Just started doing the alternate accounts so I'm pissed I heavily dislike using heavy caliber on dex sybaris due to the accuracy penalty It still obtains 51k burst dps with shred instead of heavy caliber I know She is which was a red flag for me wanting kids so early is never a good idea I have family that did that and it did not work out so well When she said her mom had cancer since like the 90s it made a whole lot more sense I find it hilarious that ignorant people who are just bigoted against Latinos rant about illegals taking their jobs when it is far more likely that it is the legal

Will not have the ability to play by the time its done downloading I think perhaps that it might not have been intended as a skill to use entirely on DDs but apparently it makes Japanese ones better at not getting wtfraped by American ones using mobile broadband thats ur problem abortion stuff God I hate how feminists portray this as evil men vs poor women Pro life vs pro choice is orthogonal to gender Both sides are evenly split male female It's almost as though there's some other issue totally separate from gender that's causing the controversy Couldn't possibly fathom what that might be even when women have control of their lives men pop up Who'd have expected so many interactions with a group that makes up of the population Personally I prefer it not because I dislike the visual but because it's tough to find visual porn which doesn't contain huge turn offs The acting often seems absurd to me and half the time I'm cringing going annnd that would not be pleasurable Not to mention the terrible sounds and camera angles It's obvious that a lot of porn is made with male viewers in mind eta though a lot of guys probably hate those shrieks etc too And it becomes even more difficult finding something hot to me when I start looking for kinks Written porn is just so much easier There's a lot written with women in mind so it's easier to find something which suits your kink and your style Whether you like hard and fast anonymous sex or something softer and more romantic there are options And no awful acting surprise weird camera angles or shrill screaming to make me cringe So I prefer written porn over visual more for the ease of finding it and for the benefit of not dealing with surprise turn offs partway through a scene than any other reason Oh man those guys are as good

eventually so minuscule that it's effectively if not BTC itself It's relevant if he could have a segue into his thought process OP is talking about smoldering stones in a task and then that guy comes

had to do was preface it with Jeez packed in Neive's cave as always I can see why people crash and then go into it even then it might be a little rough Just going for it is like being that guy that

not put paintings near the front of the hall Relevant but not really Plus us priests didn't really need the help we just wanted to make the pally's feel useful I agree with you but Rangers don't

right MURICA That sucks for you but I hope that's the case lol I broke F2P and then this happened xD Nice This is one of the best posts on this topic I've ever seen Spot fucking on Oh Clear speed meta is a meme Every game like this has always been based around clearing as fast and as efficiently as possible when it comes to the best way to play Luckily it's a largely single player game so you can play whatever builds you want to I like to play builds that kill bosses super fast and get to run around with movement skills so that's what I do If you don't like those types of builds don't play them Oh man Return to Alara with Converge Take my money I'm from Ontario and also a Celtic fan and there are also a surprising number of Celtic fans here too I guess there are just more Scottish

Gotta put on your mask before you help others Do i legally have to return the rest of the deposit even thought its in my name only and I paid him a security deposit What cleaning fees were itemized and were those fees directly related to you during the time you lived there Aw wheres your family Proofs in the video I thought Rangers had a set spell list And yeah I try not to help with the choosing process I guess what I'm looking for is some resource to give them so that they have easier access to the spells without poking through the handbook all the time It's not about that imo It's about job market saturation If the market for sociologists historians teachers etc is saturated and there are no positions that need to be filled immediately or in the next years then perhaps that degree isn't a logical choice for expecting a job afterwards It's not that people think those jobs aren't important it's that there's no jobs to be had in that field as there are no vacancies This is the situation for a lot of STEM fields too depending on where you live and those aren't smart degrees either It's not anti arts at least not for me it's anti no jobs in that field No matter what degree you do there will be challenges in your learning It makes me sad to see people struggle through school and not find a job because their degree isn't in demand and it sucks but it's the way it

Okay I thought I was a nerdy RPG player for playing those games the way you described Glad I'm not alone on that Really adds a lot to each play through for me and like you said extends the replayability The only gripe with Skyrim I have is the immense power your player wields almost immediately The mods aimed at immersion and realism have largely remedied that but the base game would have been better with a world that wasn't so ready to suck my metaphorical dick what i am trying to say is that it is effective at all ranges if you had to These two things don't go together You could use it at short range but it's not effective at that range It can do the job if forced to but there are guns that are significantly better at that Hence it's not effective It's still useful but not effective but little to no long range Long range is yards Shotguns aren't useful at yards even with slugs no but many people have difficulty hitting moving targets beyond yards with iron sights anyway Probably not I'm hoping to find something like yours but with one more star base If that doesn't happen soonish I'll pm you Its like a Mayweather fight Technically impressive but unexciting The

Easier to explain Also people irl around me often say let's play 21 instead of blackjack so it would be easier to remember the bust number with that association Although we're such nerds I'd advise never hunting red chinchompas Instead capture red salamanders until you can hunt black salamanders then trap those until black chinchompas Rather than going to capturing red chinchompas during peak times due to large numbers of PKers at blacks as others would suggest it's better to just train other skills and go to black chinchompas during quieter periods Well I can't disappoint a hedgehog now

Peep Anonymuz's tape Vice City has that same sense of dramatic and cinematic production with a lot of elements of trap mixed in i do something similar that i learned on some cooking channel turn the jar upside down and slam the lid flat against the counter to be fair it is a lot louder and more violent than some of the other methods so i try not to do it in the middle of the night but it is MUCH

guys are amazing Went to log in came here and there is my answer Nice Nuked Out oh wait I'm new to the game and aren't even trying to fill the book I'm just excited to enjoy the decorations so it's a win in my eyes too It just started and got put on hiatus for a bit so we don't know yet It's only on chapter Edit actually I just remembered that Kanna tried to kiss her friend so it's definitely heading that direction Found one today in the wild fled after one Ultra ball For people commenting it's not traditional or authentic I would like to share my opinion from little experience I have being an assistant in an Indian restaurant in the past Chicken tikka masala the dish itself has debatable origins While the curried form is today attributed to originate in UK if we look at the name tikka is the meat or vegetables roasted cooked on skewers possibly came from the Mediterranean or middle East and then the masala though it is a misnomer the type of gravy prepared for this dish possibly originated in the Mughal times Whether it was in India or the UK where they invented this dish it was basically a comfort food mixing those two concepts Thus this dish doesn't have a traditional cooking method like some other mughalai lucknowi or peshawari dishes In fact even in traditional Indian restaurants which commenters refer to I've seen each one following a different method of how they marinate when they add the meat to gravy etc So in my opinion this dish too is authentic Looks yummy Though I turned vegetarian after I left food industry lol Unless he has it too I guess then he can just chase you removed Bring forward older content Give us VoG This Neither I never get approached by either gender I have a complaint It didn't last long enough This White Guy has

totally normal Yeah instead he's sitting in front of computer and forgetting what life is all about Wing Attack is flying which is Super Effective against Exeggutor's grass type Charizard's best moveset is not pure fire like Ninetales and Arcanine Against ice bug and steel defenders fire fire would be more effective than flying fire Though to be honest there aren't any popular defenders that are those types Lapras is ice water which fire is neutral against since the fire is super effective against ice but water resists fire so those cancel out By that argument the scent of mustard can be overwhelming and repugnant to the right person This year I'll try not to drink so much accurate If you are at a world class track event and you look at the middle distance guys running up to 5000m it

obviously PR bull explanation I saw They reversed it which is great but they've never provided a remotely provided a good explanation beyond reading between the lines Intel gave them money to do it clearly Of course all that should have nothing to do with winning the award GOTY shouldn't be based on public opinion of business decisions regardless of how justified consumer dislike for them may be They don't use Thatcher Thermite RIP lol Willie can't believe it's not butter Do you recall the name of the video where he watches the infomercial about how to make money and lifts weights I have the invoice but no receipt as such The charges are listed as Replace coolant manifold Replace body control Coolant manifold Module plus tax Remember to always use jackstands and not tires In the case of bar fights I would only condone physical violence if it were absolutely necessary in the process of extricating himself or anyone he knows from the situation As you said they and any fight can cause serious physical injuries and constantly being in fights is not a badge of pride to wear I'd much rather prefer trying to deescalate the situation and leaving the area if necessary Completely agree I have pretty much exactly the same story here yay for no starbucks coffee eating up my gaming money I've spent around mostly on the Black Friday deals Pulling is much less worth the money than TM farming However I will add that having done those pulls is what got me enough units to make it worth macroing my TM farming For example those pulls got me my Miyuki Zidane Chizuru Cecils etc in addition to my one great pull of Gilgamesh and their sweet TMRs Without those pulls I was farming Ribbons Ultima Mag and Black Cowl because those were my best TMRs While decent they are not game changers like blade mastery and dual wield Song from the Depths not Horror from the Deep whoops I agree In fact I've long maintained that unicorns should be mythic rares not commons Even in fairy

bounty hunt and amped hardpoint the most I often play solo queue What drives me is good performance just good competitive nature adding to my MVP Top It frustrates me in amped hardpoint when I'm competing for MVP with someone just staying in a hard point for the majority of the match Bounty hunt is less frustrating it just feels like most people don't understand how the scoring works Sometimes luck is a factor of who you run into and if you happen to beat them Just my gripes with those game modes However the stat tracking being kept for personal view is fine for me I don't care if the KD is shown on any game type other than PvP I do like everyone having fun because it's a blast Thanks Can you search for specific options like Sports Chrono or Premium Package Plus I've never seen that option on Autotrader but I have on Car Gurus This is no argument or way to prove anything we all know what he does and doesn't do this was just in reference to last night's game Yes again This

them kali takes more mechanics than odin shit auto attack canceling with loki's takes more skill than odin does I have the same problem It's the dark side of whaling I have had some server problems and when I requested a refund the first time it was fine but after that they were kind of not feeling it rofl I think she was just the first good women fighter in the UFC Then she started this wave of other women who are much better than her Like she's been straight embarrassed the past fights I don't really think Rousey was all that great ever Just comparatively Good to know I know it doesn't do

really don 27t ever crosspost me or my subreddit match Get a backbone You guys whine about everything Who cares what someone says over the internet Your and this subreddit's insecurities shouldn't

capacitance of a child I wanted to stay home and play Ps4 Looks like I have to go to the party now lol Also Grog and hell pretty much anyone there Just started watching recently was intimidated for a long time by the 3hr episodes but I was thinking about rewatching Titansgrave and found out Laura was in Critical Role too so that convinced me to give it a chance or so episodes in and loving it I uh I encourage violence is one of my favorites Holy Cow Shit I'm convinced Yeah you can have every job and class leveled both combat and gatherer crafter You're limited to three crafter specializations at once but that's not really something you'll need to worry about unless you get heavy into high end crafting lol That tank top They're a great combination He was the first Dropped a there buddy Dudes just asking people to look out for something he lost and cares about If you dont care dont waste your time opening the post and commenting Do you leave your cards in your house when youre not home Hope you get robbed then Reddit is really obsessed with porn Cids quests give you the ultima weapon which is an end game weapon Kodak Uzi and Yachty are relatively young artists all under They've been making music for only a few years How long has tyga been making the same level of mediocre music He has had plenty of time to progress and actually improve but he hasn't Stayed up another hour to watch the fireworks in London Did not disappoint That's extremely dismissive and I can do the same to NV NV is a very hollow game A majority of the NPCs are just clones of one another and they had about the same amount of lines as they did voice actors https www youtube com watch v SSUEE e8a0I You talk about how FO4 was nothing but action Well NV could have used some of that as you would run into maybe a rad scorpion and two raiders if you were lucky as you crossed large barren lands between point A and point B Not to mention the combat was clunky with terrible AI There was almost nothing to New Vegas itself as well You had the outskirts that had a shop a couple of greasers must be those heavily story based characters you were talking about and a makeshift hospital The city was what casinos a mostly empty tower and NCR base The streets we empty save maybe hookers some NCR and a random fodder NPC here and there But sure all of that is made up for some skill checks that instantly solved quest Skills that were otherwise arbitrary aside from the hard points you needed for a perk I could go on and on if I wanted to which I don't I love NV but this is the only way I can make a point about this topic I think you and a lot of vocal people on Reddit do this thing where you're hyper negative on the new releases while giving the old ones a huge pass Yeah I miss the skill checks and I think having a voiced protagonist limited dialog options but game excels in just about every other category from mechanics to world building It has weaker roleplay in some aspects but stronger roleplay in others Sneaking through the warzone that was the streets of Boston as a glass cannon scout was very immersive and really made me feel like my character Same with the mechanic character I made with the focus on base building and the robo DLC If you really didn't like FO4 that's fine But I really hate this negative absolutes when it comes to discussing the game like it's some universally held opinion People like FO4 and it isn't because they are simple new or don't know any better Haha playing on the entitlement card to garner support my that is amazing Its not entitled to expect evidence to back up claims Yeah the retardation is too strong for me I am out years assuming no taxes Haha I was waiting for someone to make this comment after I posted and realized how much I got into it Should've called it Four Quick Reviews Do people not use holo I love it unlike the ACOG it leaves you more peripheral vision I'm comparing the entire Surface lineup that is every Microsoft computer they brand and sell to the Mac lineup or the iPad lineup Whether they're buying it because they want to use macOS or because of its industrial design is completely irrelevant to my argument More people want and are buying iPads and Macs If Apple had launched a business that did as little as Surface in revenue it just may be labeled as a mainstream flop Doesn't matter if you're earning it or not Would you take a job making hr Probably not because you know your time is worth more than that My point is that if you have to stop what you're doing whether it's socializing or reading a book or baking a cake in order to move a coin to your coin jar then you have essentially made the decision to work ten seconds at a rate somewhere south of hr You get no benefit from moving the coin except its monetary value Kind of silly example yes but properly valuing your labor and time has to start on a micro level Your time isn't worthless and there is a cost to saving that coin YES Just print the mtgo holiday cube already do it like yesterday print the cards bigger than regular cards or smaller or do whatever it takes gold border pink boarder different backs you get banned from magic for life if you play them outside of a cube IDK make it like a living card game add expansions every year or months or whatever would pay mb more for a full vintage holiday cube with the power in it What a waste boarding actions and the like Actually storm trooper specifically refers to the units that specialized in trench assault and foothold defense They in a way were forerunners to more modern infantry combined arms companies in that they carried a variety of equipment required for independent operations Well it's more like the opposite Hardcore music is pop Honestly I've been using my keys trying to get a bond because I think it looks awesome Instead I am gifted a rainbow of Devil's Dawn's I've never taken kratom while sick but I know opiates always helped when I had a cold and I mean aside from the opiate euphoria just making me feel wonderful They always both suppressed my cough opium codeine and or hydrocodone have long been in formulations prescribed for coughs and cleared out my sinuses as good as any decongestant If opiates do it I would guess that kratom would do the same Oh yeah TRUE I'm retarded sorry haha Then it doesn't really matter if you remove it Just craft something you need the most on it Ok then I'm off to sleep Nah packs and got bahamut No worries buddy If it happens it happens If not I'll fill ya in on any info the Massive boys share that isn't classified you know they don't use beaver units The wiki is a decent way to start If you got any questions just go right ahead Well regardless I survived mostly unscathed just a bit of a bruised hip and I wasn't suggesting it as the only or best option I was only saying that if it's a submaximal weight is unlikely to severely injure someone If they are strong enough to rep it they are probably strong enough to perform the roll of shame with it Oh I didn't know that I wonder why some heroes are more popular than others I agree that online is the future And that football is rightfully the greatest sport in the world I disagree that sports is not about storylines we've had some amazing ones in Leicester The Cubs The Golden State Warriors the first title in Cleveland in over years Kobe's retirement Peyton's retirement Ronda Rousey Happy new year and hopefully is a great year for sports as well Let the crowing of the rooster not only signify the beginning of the next day but as the beginning of a new year I just edited it ' D Well considering even the day after the Angel City Most Wanted patch dropped the numbers were still in the thousands and on Christmas day there were people playing I think its just immortal i should have gotten a written statement saying that she would not pursue claims against me and exchanged info but i didn't Even if you had thought of it no person in their right mind would sign such a document on the side of the road immediately after getting hit Not infrequently injuries appear days weeks after a car accident If they didn't ask for your information you are probably fine But if they did take down your license plate and you get a letter from them or their insurance company tell your insurance company so that they can handle it If the police come to ask you questions refuse to answer except in the presence of your attorney and then go get one I'm guessing mix is ideal They second half is Security and means something Investments can be lost Companies pension system can be obliterated Or perhaps what they really do is they drink the whole bottle then use cooking as an excuse as to why it's all gone Dammit ya beat me to it Original

It would work in a controlled PVP ONLY environment where you could Matchmake and see what the other team agents are using before the match starts Also you're refering to things that have been fixed months ago that makes no sense Patch was balanced and PVP was fun all we are missing are PVP only game modes All those broken things you refered are all and only fault of Devs in Massive that don't know what they are doing It was not hard to understand Reclaimer would be pure AIDS before they even introduced it in the game in and so on Problem is that the people that introduce this things to the game don't know their own game or have ever played something similiar Was it that hard to predict that Uncomplicated talent AB would be OP I mean it's plenty obvious The funny thing is I seem to recall one of the explanations why the original five even work is that ultimately they were an alternate version of themselves So young Bobby could be gay and old Bobby could be straight To me he's an off fielder they don't even know where the field is I mean for god sakes there are lines that show you the cutoff point Lol And don't forget the condensation water dripping exactly on the phone screen from the nose all the time when there is cold outside I'll check out the book Thanks Won't matter as he hasn't fixed the bug with the TSS issue with apple yet Honestly I'm starting to become skeptic about his tool actually working I will GLADLY eat my words but it's been like days and the bug of the TSS issue still hasn't been fixed Only person that the tool seems to work for is himself Just starting to become skeptical since it hasn't worked for anyone at all but will gladly eat my words I've decided to give up the booze for next year Edit I feel bad now guys it was a joke about leaving it until next year I'd only play Sab for Vortex traps There are some things like Chin Sol trapper that can work with Sunblast and whatnot but in general Sab will be the best I think it's better to knock it down as close to prestige as you can get it They don't know who did it and yet teams can mop it up if they want especially lower level than Trainers The same team would also have to actually prestige it back up if they want to keep it rather than being able to get it up to level immediately without any work involved They still dot know who might have done it so the retaliation factor is still there Much more frustrating IMO nice edit Got two maintenance prompts secs as I was loading Let it Die Kept going and just got in South Florida here removed removed congratulations Well I'm going to HT tomorrow so I'll find out then I've been told by my friend who manages a GameStop that they will be starting preorders immediately after the announcement at the press event If you need PB for Pools you are bad it has nothing to do with the job lol I form shift anytime I'm off the boss when I get back to the boss during pools I instantly refresh GL3 for example there is zero need for PB during that Honestly if you are losing GL3 to pools Also BOTD seconds lol once more relevant GL3 refresh seconds relevant BOTD refresh second That's a great thought I kind of forget what the game is capable of now and I've looked at raids like massive boss sort of like KQ stat wise imagine 20 blowpipes shredding through that But as you pointed out thoughts like that are likely worthless Nope However you could if you wanted to fire your guns in increments adjusting between each shot if you're still zeroing in on your target But really there's not an actual difference Do you mean that no indies released this year lived up to your standards for a top or that no indie game ever could make your list because it's indie If it's the latter that seems like a strange and arbitrary restriction Like what budget in dollars does a game need to have before its content is worthy to be placed on a top list It just seems weird to exclude indie as a category as that term can be used to describe so many different kinds of games that it becomes pretty meaningless Apparently not haha The reddit hivemind has decided otherwise This this Push lane kill minions get a kill if possible even better if

revive lucky egg incense pokeballls threw them all away yesterday great balls ultra balls razz berry The daily gym runs deplete our potions and we get overloaded on pokeballs trying to get them back since the stop distribution seems to be Pokeballs to potion I have several hurt Pokemon that I just can't heal because I need what little potions I have for gym battles And my inventory is better today than it usually is in that regard because we hit up more stops while looking for Charmanders yesterday How the heck you got max revives is beyond me though I'll make a stop run of stops and be

I think million was how much had been spent not how much over budget it was And they did create an amazingly well optimized engine during production Microsoft is a low bar They are sort of in the periphery of everyone's attention and anytime they manage to do anything half competent everyone is surprised It's easy to speak positively of them when expectations are low or non existent Apple is a high bar Everyone expects the best from them They are the standard that everything else is compared to and have a long history with devoted critical users They are more scrutinized than any other technology company So there is a lot of criticism out there of Apple and their products That doesn't mean people hate Tim Cook or Apple though It would be wise to discern the sincere and thoughtful people that criticize Apple from the woe is me trolls that think Apple is doomed and that Tim Cook should be ousted because the latest MacBook Pro didn't have enough RAM for some subset of users or

Chrome is by far the fastest and even Opera is beating Firefox as this stage They are ok ish but can be really wonky I'd say the main problem with the bis' guns is that they're a bit too unreliable when it comes to accuracy at medium longer ranges They can still do stuff but everything can do stuff up to their max range It being effective however is something different altogether awkward and gross pic Oh I would like to have a nice winter So you didn't play Siege for like months I'm biased so I as go for the Cutlass ok I laughed good one Mm not really a fan of artstyles where they exaggerate the hips thighs to such a ridiculous degree Ten u amazingpikachu should like this one Except they headline some sizable festival lineups and get big crowds Their sales and steam numbers aren't big because a this was released Xmas week when very few people are concerned about new music and b thy released the album entirely for free download to all their fans My husband and I were laughing about the strike scoring since when doing regular strikes everyone has learned where you can just hop skip and sparrow past a room of creatures and where you need to fight before the next area becomes available But now scoring per kill and bonuses for kill type is in the mix every single area is cleared out before moving on and once the area is cleared it's a race to the next area to see if you can wipe out the room before your strikemates get there P No arguments there It's deffinately difficult to drive Im pushing at the wheels and most full face clutch I've found eventually

allahu acbkar but no way to be sure that would find the turks are now saying there was possibly a single attacker part of the reasons the death toll is high is because it was a nightclub completely full people reportedly and somebody went in and opened fire straight on everyone no claims that i know about yet but the modus operandi fits with daesh once again At that point I'm starting to think

was a beast no problem This is a Public Service Announcment WE WUZ I'd take a set of Continental DWS all seasons all day over some random unknown winter tire brand That is what you said and I replied to Nothing there says to look at tire rack You said because you don't know a brand you prefer an inferior tire that you do know Chinese knock off's aren't real All tires sold need to be DOT certified and meet a high set of standards You get them because they are highly rated by a very well trusted testing company and the blizzaks are not in stock Not rocket science here No your no seasons do not beat even mediocre real summer tires when they are on a properly equipped car Don't forget they fitted your car with prius tires to intentionally let it slide around because it lacks the power to do so So your car comes improperly equipped for what it is from the factory Don't project that inadequacy on other cars as virtually no other cars do something that silly The DWS only are better then your factory tires because your factory tires are shit on purpose Also how did this become about what you put on your car This is someone else asking for what snow tires to get your needs don't come into play here I get that you like tires that are mediocre in all situations and aren't really good at anything but geez man calm down a bit I don't like them and if you can go on about your love for them I can point out they are actually shit It goes both ways Also if you buy your tires at a place they usually swap them out for free as needed I have never once paid for it outside the first installation Try using a good shop next time All seasons are used because people are cheap and lazy and don't want to do things the proper way and instead want a simple if worse solution They have let marketing teams tell them that something that is mediocre at everything is somehow better than having to go to the tire shop twice a year Tires are a safety device and saving a little time and money

last year Thanks for putting this together man You have cards in that lineup I didnt even know existed lol I loved the Fleener card last year Do you think thats a viable option He has better run block than Graham and Clark with kind of comparable recieving stats But the chem masters from solos should open up enough coins that I can fit in a Sean Taylor OOP I know using that many coins in one spot isnt ideal But on a user I really want to use that card as a user Maybe to help me out or idk haha Original post https www reddit com r TankPorn comments 5lcisd happy new year reddit japan ground

those years Nice A chicken got revenge on me too once when I broke a molar crunching down on one of it's bones once Imo if you're ever going trans crit is better than quin sais also ur getting ichaival really late into that build where ur opposition has probably already started into crit Just build him like a normal adc but with trans The reason you wanna get crit instead of quin sais is ur high power doesnt benefit quin sais wheres a crit would You could go trans warrior OR ninja tabi asi wind demon deathbringer titans bane You could replace trans lategame though and get another crit item like malice replacing trans with another crit item is pretty common unless you're some1 like nieth I prefer getting NT with a trans build cause you're so far into the early game without AS and AS translates into the lategame much better than extra power Another build you could do which is more high power and pen would be trans ninja tabi asi quin sais titans bane o bow With that build you could focus down tanks and ur AS is so high that executioner might be overkill for the AS Golden bow is great with trans builds and can deal a ton of damage in a teamfight its essentially like another half crit item Titans bane is better for ability based hunters like ullr over executioner because your abilities will benefit from titans bane pen everytime whereas with executioner you have to stack the protection shred on some1 BEFORE your abilities and autos can benefit from it and with ullr you're pretty long range so titans bane is more favourable Bethesda aka the only company that can

hair out Rule Try to catch EVERY non evolved Starter and Santachu encountered Rule Use ONLY normal pokeball with curve and great throw on Starters and Santachu If it runs away the spawn rate is so high you'll encounter another soon enough Rule Use Great Ultra Razz ONLY on suspected high IV high CP ones you'll get pretty good at predicting ballpark IV during catching from looking at their catch ring colour in correlation to their CP Rule For evolved starters attempt capture ONLY if there's a reasonable chance of capture low CP or there's reasonable chance of high IV most realistically would be a level with CP in the upper limits in which case refer to Rule Rule Limit Ultra Ball usage to max tries per mon if I ever decide to use them unless if that CP Charizard is reaaally pissing me off

ups and downs Exactly if I even consider having kids I'm absolutely never going to do it unless I positive that it's what I want It's just plain unfair to the hypothetical kid to do otherwise Nah what I've started saying is that I'm too selfish and irresponsible to responsibly have children but luckily I'm responsible enough to realize that and selfless enough to not do it Then I walk away while

fishing spots but it's just easier to buy them and re spool when durability is lower than approx half Also fishing in the sea seems more difficult than in the lake On Silvermoon EU it costs around 110k You can make that in about hours of farming herbs I just farm for about hour every day and can buy it easily every month Of course that may not be the case in a few months since herb prices have been going down steadily No you mis read what I meant I understand the difference between player and team synergies but what I mean was that I noticed a change as soon as I equipped those synergies What I was asking is if I would notice the RF on the players who have or is it not even a synergie that I should basically get guys for and waste my time season four of Sherlock which airs tomorrow Shut the front door I know what I'm watching tomorrow You can try Bowler Ice Golem Graveyard combo I don't use this kind of deck so I don't know what to add more I'm pretty sure there's a ton of guide deck here for Graveyard so you can look it all up Not Europe I think I can speak on this as a white nationalist I find that the media tends to call us neo nazis or white supremacists to a greater degree than we self identify as those things Most of us will call ourselves alt right or white nationalists Also white nationalism is typically something only found in former European colonies like the U S Canada or Australia European or South African equivalents would be ethno nationalism While there are some supremacist elements and beliefs within our groups first and foremost we are nationalists None of us mind other groups having nationalistic movements themselves In fact I'd wager most of us would be fine working with Black nationalists or Hispanic nationalists to achieve our common goals This isn't without precedent either https bp blogspot com CbcE6rSSouc WAL8t2PEfHI AAAAAAAALfQ Ss8iDFtDQYQDYTxngXc3uLVd4cz rKBowCLcB s1600 George Lincoln Rockwell nation of islam jpg We don't want to reinstitute slavery or commit genocide or anything like that Our mainly and in some cases only goal is to have an ethno state where we are the super majority This would be achieved by carving up existing nations along ethnic lines If you ever hear someone mention the Amerikaner state this is what they're talking about We also don't reject identity politics like Libertarians but instead embrace them Here's http www npr org were not going away alt right leader on voice in trump administration an article where Richard Spencer mentions this Generally I think the collapse of traditional social structures is helping the rise of the far right and far left People are feeling lost and hopeless and are searching for answers In many ways this is similar to the early mid 20th century when people last sought out the far left and far right Personally speaking identitarian arguments from SJWs and feminists have helped convinced me of the benefits of group identity Racially they focus on groups that have traditionally lost in cultural conflict with whites such as Native Americans and Black Americans These groups could be considered identity deficient due to losing much of their original culture and cultural self expression being limited due to their status of minorities in a white majority nation However I think that whites could also be said to be identity deficient as a consequence of our victory in the global cultural conflict We've entered into a sort of post identity era In order for identity to exist there has to be something that sets you apart from the rest of humanity but with the global domination of European and especially Anglo American culture there isn't anything unique to whites anymore At this point many aspects of white culture can be thought of as the global human culture with non whites having their local cultures to foil against ours Liberal academia conceptualizes this phenomena as post colonialism but I would consider it part of the structural collapse mentioned above Initially I was an individualist as I suspect many of you are but I was pushed away from that mindset once I began to realize that individual actions are merely the result of genetics biological environment and social environment This is another area where I was influenced by feminist thought specifically intersectional feminism An intersectional feminist views a person as solely the product of their intersecting social identities In many ways this perspective is correct the non biological components of our selves are inextricably linked to our social identities Everything about us from our purpose in life to our sexualities to our personalities is partially determined by these identities which are in turn inseparably tied into our social groupings Thus a society with strict social norms if those norms incentivize people to reach the behavioral limits of their biology is the structure under which humanity could achieve its greatest potential Ultimately when Melony looks at Serena and Alexis she sees her culture and identity lose just a little bit more of its uniqueness and distinctiveness just as I do From her perspective a culture that has fought so hard for recognition and self hood is absorbed into whiteness and from my perspective a little bit more of the culture I feel like I barely knew is dissolved into our global society All either of us want is the survival of our societies and cultures Hey man Hang in there It'll happen some day Just keep putting yourself out there We overestimate how much can change in a day but underestimate how much can change in a year End of you could be thinking about the gorgeous women you've been with the past year So just take it one step at a time buddy Unfortunately it wasn't the case I was given the ultimatum and I was forced to choose See my daughter or Play a game I was so addicted to If my wife had left me I'd been OK hadn't my daughter been in the picture I know that sounds selfish of me but it's the way I've always been and I can't seem to change even if I wanted to When I'm off work for a day I don't want to go shopping and walk around the mall I want to drink a damn beer and shoot some dreg heads Luckily for me I've been permitted to play once more under the premise I don't play but hours a week which I can use however I choose

this sick terrorism again Also Turkey is not Europe so I don't see why this belongs here You don't own a game when you purchase it You purchase the license to play the game and by doing do you must agree to adhere to the applicable licensing conditions I totally get what you're saying and I don't disagree I often used no CD cracks for games I own on my PC as I couldn't be bothered to swap discs all the time But strictly speaking that could be seen as a license violation It's simply the world we live in these days It's all meaningless Anti natalism is the answer s It's cool he's been doing

Same problem I was having all day for my second profile Spent hours talking to support Issue is with their servers I can't even buy the free GWG game and it will probably be too late by the time they fix things I specifically bought a month of Gold to see if payment works but it's only showing up for One titles and not the games I don't think he was calling them out for paid sponsorship deals he was calling them out for paid positive promotion Look at Conan's segments on upcoming or newly released games which are paid advertisement sections of his show Quite frequently he completely rips those games apart if he doesn't enjoy them Even for entertainers I think it's unethical to portray the game in a positive light if they personally didn't enjoy it That just makes you an extension of the publisher's marketing team I wish he would But unless his game sells much more than thousand vive won't offer that kind of money I doubt they even overed money I think they over a Desk and manpower but that said onward could become that what counter strike was in early standart shooters days Happy new year guys and girls I have goals not resolutions I finished the dungeon this morning and I have to say its god damn awful Aside from having to face my fear of falling into pure nothingness pure darkness it was quite frustrating to get through Nonetheless I got that damn hood and I wish there was a trophy to show off my accomplishement Are you sure Skyrim is too new How old does it have to be I mean it's already years old I rent all of mine so it does help a lot I've never pay that much Only one semester has cost me a lot and it was around Only one of those games got the remake recently If the remake was like years old and was still played then sure You saying not a contradiction over and over doesn't magically make all the contradictions disappear You're desperately trying to connect the dots to make Blake's actions make sense even though everything she's done has flown in the face of what she's said she's trying to do She says she's trying to avoid the WF yet goes out of her way to confront them every time she gets the chance even when doing so is directly at odds with her rest and see my family mission You can't argue your way out of that You fucking can't I get this on a daily basis with every mission I just queue up after click wait for players the play anyway and people join on me Not me way too many spoilers unless I don't intend to see the movie then fine I get the Cole's notes version in seconds The rare exception are carefully crafted trailers that don't spoil anything So you spend hours on Overwatch but got way more enjoyment out of TWD because of a little girl That's whack removed Mr Toru it's a show where contestants say there

humourous deserves an upvote s Those aren't even close to the same Playing a game means constantly holding certain keys for periods of time and quickly switching to others and even holding multiple at

have any questions or concerns To preface this answer I need to give some context Hawking Dawkins and Krauss all promote this idea It stems from science which supports that the universe must be flat and have a total energy of zero By that they mean the combination of negative energy from gravity and the positive energy of other forces create a totally self contained system that does not violate the laws of physics This means in an empty universe the vast infinite ocean of nothing now known as a quantum field is the source of all particles and anti particles The big reveal is that this quantum field can coalesce to a point where it can fluctuate over an infinite amount of time In this universe time is irrelevant It will eventually fluctuate enough to cause a new universe set off by a runaway chain reaction where particles and anti particles don't interact enough to settle down back into the quantum field This is where you get stuff basically everything we can see in the universe This doesn't violate the laws of physics because nothing is being created or destroyed here the quantum field is the same as before just in a different state Similar to a cup of water being boiled into vapor the water is the same it's just in a different state of matter While that sounds great and all there are still issues with this great answer to everything Hawking Dawkins and Krauss all really get in your face about it and love to flash it around like it disproves God and other ridiculous things scientists should not do but it has a huge problem The problem with this answer is that you get a turtles all the way down problem Where did the quantum field come from In other words if that is the universe and how it originates where did the originator mechanic the quantum field originate from Why is it there It's not a nothing it's a something It exists What brought it into existence The mystery has not been solved Hawking and other physicists just moved the goalpost The universe is not only infinite and incomprehensible but also has infinite and incomprehensible answers to its infinite and incomprehensible mysteries So happy to see people unite to help animals My cat

whatsoever It's right where the run narrows too Luckily I landed in a pile of fresh snow Glad to see The President starting tonight I know it's because of Delly's injury but hopefully this is the final proving point socalherbremedies is next Generation the best movies There are also heroes filling two roles just to add on the point you're making and what the video was about An example is if you go bruisers they make up for a tank and a DPS together Tyrande and Tassadar lacks proper healing alone but they both fill a void in the DPS department I feel the problem is that the role system is too simplified when certain heroes fills more than one role at once You need to learn this by either playing those heroes or learning it outside of it which not all players seem to do and the game doesn't really help you with these simplified roles I'm not defending them but I do find it annoying when white women shame white males for their skin color You could always just take the Feat Magic

sure about that guaranteed Yeah I hope he didn't use his one douche too soon It varies a lot but well your food and rent costs can only go so low even if you live in a low cost town city That's why taxes are not just percentage based but the percentage rises as you make more money Regardless I would pay my rent twice if I could make hour I'd still come out ahead I know a guy who was a chef on a

looks for new music Xmas week though Plus it's a free release That's the most likely reasons for unimpressive numbers I think the issue is people look at it and think I can't stun a raid boss this is useless But they forget that a lot of raid bosses have adds that can be stunned And then they say well haste isn't a good stat for me and I don't need to move Well fuck haste is one of my worst stats but an extra for ten seconds is a lot of haste which means my energy regen is a lot higher and my attacks happen faster As far as not needing to move that may be TRUE but it never hurts to move a little faster And honestly for most classes right now it takes gcd to proc it Which is minimal for the return And once it can proc on interrupts well there are lots of bosses that can be interrupted

Bitpay I used to think like that too It took ages for guildies to convince me to use steam but when I finally did I thought it was okay Same for origin Then I saw problems Take DarkSpore A game that I had to use a client before I could even load the game a game I played in beta liked so much I even went out bought a new gfx card just to play it better Used to play single player occasionally co op Then after a while of playing other games I returned to DarkSpore to play single player only for the icon on origin being unclickable It wasn't until I searched online if others had same problem how they fixed it that I found out the games servers had been murdered it would never be playable again including the single player https www youtube com watch v T2pdvh4uiaM Similar happened when Gamespy died ARMA series wasn't able to be used until much later when it was attached to steam servers But I had three copies of ARMA2 series all were forced onto steam because steam is steam I now only have one copy of ARMA2 Look at it another way steam had that mass outage other night They never said sod all nothing new there In the mean time anyone wanting to play games had to play offline which is of

imaginable I'm not saying Yuri on Ice doesn't have a target audience but maybe just maybe it's a bit smaller than the vast majority of people who are obsessed with anime Nope MCW might actually be better removed Huh that is actually very interesting I did indeed only study 3d from a film perspective so that does help me understand it quite a bit better in the context of VR The fact that you can move around in the space does make a difference in how you perceive it compared to the relative sizes portrayed on a screen where perhaps the IPD is not as obvious I appreciate your input and this new bit of information thank you If bitcoin appeals to diverse ideologies more the merrier Bitcoin is a big tent of voluntary transactions Bruhhhhh top floor I know that I just wanted to post it anyway I

smaller tv producers and staff lose jobs Only if they are trying to compete with big players head on If they start creating good quality niche content then people who want that content will happily pay Like they could be the 90s sitcom rerun channel with no commercials that plays the shows in order of broadcast I'd sign up for that as they should be cheaper to run and operate because they're not making their own content Already a New Year The best thing never changes And again this would be another year of Tamamo posting Are you ready I'm excited Woooo Mountain goats are one of those bands that I can put their full discography on shuffle and just enjoy every song Can still get shot to shit but yea the guns are awesome D im down on ps4 too Oh then I totally agree with you to a slightly lesser extent Mature unbiased discussion about being LGBT or biased discussion as long as it's a discussion and not an argument is perfectly fine IMO Full on parades about being LGBT Eh that's stretching boundaries Ah the Harlem Shake Irrelevant comment most of my class stopped loving the Harlem Shake once I told them that the dance move wasn't original I said it was called The Weekender Don't know if that's TRUE but hey they stopped But now they think they're so that's a thing I know the best places to go to implant that thought Health classes That's why I'm so open to LGBT people my teacher a hardcore liberal was not only one of the most pardon my Paris fucking badass people in my school but he also supported people expressing individuality Hell he even went so far as to stop a homophobic janitor from cleaning his classroom for a few weeks because he said that the staff member was just as dirty as the trash he wants to pick up Ah the memories Anyways just add that little number into health class and maybe people will accept the fact In theory Also slightly irrelevant There is a fine line between criticizing LGBT and insulting LGBT There's always gonna be that one misanthrope who thinks the world can shove it Other than that yeah it's a vicious cycle IMO it has been getting boring to talk about LGBT I just hope Trump doesn't do anything to reduce voter turnout or something stupid like that A different racing mode versus an entire card game Hmmm Nah not just you I'm there with yah I know For some reason it's not appearing even though I type it in Most steam users don't even know what tf2 is skyrim is really popular so they hit what ever they can recognize
