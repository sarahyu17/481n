I'm calmer more even minded I don't immediately start crying when I wake up in the morning and realize how trashed my life is I am less angry and am getting in fewer violent confrontations on the street as a result I actually have a bit of peace of mind for the first time in a long time I never knew what normal was So I am just thankful my life doesn't seem to be spinning out of control and that I can assume that I won't over the course of a day swing into one of those really nasty black depressive moments when all seems lost and I lose my ability reason and work at a level that is basic to functioning in the workplace Any thing is better than what was before Thank you science

Balls don't hurt anymore and it was a small drop of blood I saw I should fix that in my post No more blood after the initial sighting as well I'm more emotionally hurt right now more than anything I was supposed to go to a friend's house but that didn't happen and now I hear there are a bunch of people at her house So that's why I started edging in the first place To ease the emotional scar                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Policies may vary so double check with the mover of your choice When I shipped my car I was able to load however much I wanted so long as the mover could see out the sides and back your car may have to be shuffled on the hauler as they make pick ups and drop offs en route to you the driver needs to see to move the car Car movers is one of those industries that have serious issues with con artists Do your research before hiring someone Don't be too cheap it'll bite you in the ass                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Thank you so much for the kind words I'm a college student so it is admittedly hard to find people like that All my friends back home in Jersey are varying degrees of heavy drinkers and so are the ones at school Everyone seems to both poo poo my drinking but also scold me so I don't really have any productive help I have a therapist I've been working with and I'm going to bring this up to my medical doctor when I go home in a week                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
The comments here  as of the time of this writing are what I expected to read and also what I needed to read I know I am doing her wrong by staying in this I am also doing myself a disservice This is a rebound relationship for her after a failed multiple year marriage Part of her motivation in pursuing me was to respond to her ex husband finding another woman I have very little relationship experience I went into this with a let's try this out mentality It was dishonest on my part to stay with her as the hookup stage gradually ended and something else rose in its place My life plans do not include any permanent romantic partners kids or family connections To the best that I can tell she is looking for another husband or someone to treat as such We generally have a good time when we are together this has been covering up the fact that we are fundamentally incompatible On the occasions in which we have spoken about it she has made clear that she is not going to end this I have to do it sometime soon for both of us

 I can see where confusion might spawn We are people pleasers so we are fully willing to listen to all of our FP's problems But we only have this empathy for our FP we don't give a fuck about anyone else This is ass kissing not empathy I would know more than anyone I have done some really pathetic things Thats you I felt very badly for the delivery man sent to my house without the right money He was shaking and his voice faltered and was obviously very uncomfortable I understood what it would be like to be put in that position by his employer and I felt angry for him at his employer

JK Rowling made a very nice Christmas tweet that really helped me In part it reads Ive also heard from people who are going through very tough times  These always seem worse at Christmas   At this time of year  were bombarded with images of perfect lives  which bear as little relation to reality as tinsel does to gold   If youre lucky enough to be with the people you love  warm and safe  with enough to eat  Im sure you feel as blessed as I do   But if your life is currently full of difficulties  if you arent where you want to be  either literally or figuratively  remember that extraordinary transformations are possible  Everything changes  Nothing is forever   Thinking back to my worst Christmas  I found it hard to believe that my unhappiness would pass  I was truly afraid of the future   You never know what the future holds  Astonishing reversals of fortune happen every minute   So if youre sad  or lonely  or bereaved  or ill  separated from your loved ones or in any other way suffering this Christmas  I send you love and wish you luck and better times  Millions of us have been where you are now   Remember  Christmas Day is  in the end  just a day  It isnt a test or a scorecard of you or your life  so be kind to yourself  That last one is really the heart of it all To reiterate to today New Years Eve is in the end just a day It isnt a test or a scorecard of you or your life so be kind to yourself I spent many many years doing nothing making FALSE promises and seeing nothing come of them Even today it's really easy to get stuck in a mire of I'm still overweight  I don't have a girlfriend  this year was wasted but it's very hard to pause and go I started gaming with friends every week  I started some D D with reddit strangers that goes every week  I took 3 trips for myself  I spent a lot of money just on myself to make me happy I guarantee you that there's a lot you did for yourself this year to take heart in outside of the two big goals of being fit and getting a girlfriend

The state college sounds like a good idea to me it probably offers whatever you can imagine studying and will be fun and since you know someone going there thats nice as well I would be hesitant of your third option because  they dont offer a potential major you might end up with and  If you can have the real college experience i e cost isnt going to kill you persee then I say do it Im guessing the cost of the state school is less than the local private school as well which would be helpful in that aspect Do whats right for you tho too Goodluck                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 I text her later and asked her if being affectionate at this point would be a bad idea for her recovery and she replied I don't know  I don't want to think about anything right now  I love you  She's telling you with words and behavior to not pressure her When I was barely sober needed time to figure out who I was and how to build a sober happy life You might be very distracting by putting pressure on her to be sexual when she has told you she doesn't want to deal with it right now Please respect this fragile time in her life                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
I gotta be honest I'm here just sobbing I don't want to drink but I don't know how to get past this moment I played the tape out and I will not drink  was so bad for me moving across the country relapsing after  years Come the fuck on  I'm done And I am so ready and willing to move forward with my life                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
TV series Find something out there you like with at least three seasons and you're gonna love it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
For me Cymbalta worked really well for anxiety also had you noticed in the post i'm not addicted to opoids Like I said I tried them one time the second time I was going to but got rid of them instead As far as the alcoholism goes I've had to quit cold turkey for a couple months at a time at points when suppliers moved away and such I never had withdrawels and within the five days since my last drink none have occurred And this drinking was literally so bad for some one my age I guess but bad for anybody I assume That I would drink and then make myself throw up just so I could drink more This didn't happen often I have not had any withdrawals of alcohol ever And I'm not on prozac but what did you mean by withdrawals from that Or Cymbalta or whatever What is Cymblata is this something I should talk about with my doctor Xanax of course on the lowest dosage so far has had no noticeable affects in my mood Maybe it helps anxiety and I just don't realize it or something And what is suboxone NALTREXONE and SUBOXONE are medications to keep you from doing drugs and drinking SUBOXONE is an opioid that blocks the effects of any other opioids It's also sometimes prescribed for pain I'm thinking if you have pain issues it may not be a good idea Naltrexone is for addiction ss well but I take it to help with the night eating I get from my antidepressants Xanax for anxiety is going to flatten your personality out and they also need to be increased constantly because its short acting Maybe consider Klonopin which is better suited for someone who doesnt want to pop pills all day I've had them all and stopped because they are the worst to come off of For anxiety I had great luck with Cymbalta but everyone is different For anxiety I found the Beta blockers work best A low dose of Inderall helps a lot You have a dangerous alcohol problem The binging and purging thing is interesting While I don't believe in addiction I do think your drinking is a symptom of some sort of personality disorder As a safety net try naltrexone for a month so you can get ahead of the drinking and focus on what the problem is You could have ADHD for all I know Symptoms range from a total disregard for your health to getting hyperfocused on substances Sucks about the shots                      
You're just giving them a reason not to hire you Why freely disclose something they cannot ask you about I'd love to believe we live in a perfect world and they won't discriminate against something they shouldn't in the hiring process but let's be real We live in the real world and self disclosure of this during the hiring process is the absolute wrong move Discuss accommodations after you're hired                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Good for you mate Have fun                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
I have plenty of empathy for people who deserve it You put the word advice in quotes but that doesn't make it not TRUE People keep saying it because it is TRUE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Don't give up on drawing Actually think of it as some motivation to keep your life going to get better at something I promise you I was very very bad when i started drawing I look back at some of the stuff and cringe But now I love to draw and while i know it's not perfect i keep striving to do better It makes me happy and i think it could make you happy too Start by drawing some of your favorite video game or manga characters and instead of berating it find the little flaws and figure out how you could fix them and you'll be improving in no time There are many other ways to create things as well Some people are good with air dry clay others love to make music some like to sew etc I'm not having suicidal thoughts at the moment but have been the past month or so My boyfriend has lymphoma and it's been making me feel quite depressed It's easier said than done but you just gotta remind yourself of the things in life that you DO love Relaxing drawing anime and video games make you happy maybe if only for a while but you have to latch on to things like that Please please please don't decide to end your life I know you may not think so but from the short conversation we've had so far i can tell that you're quite smart and lovely with deep interests All you have to do is find some tiny bit of motivation inside you to keep going Being social is hard I know first hand But it becomes a lot easier when you find people who share the same interests as you whether it be online or in real life It's just something you have to take day by day You mentioned you have one friend ask them if they want to go window shopping one day Ask them if they'd like to go out to eat During depressive episodes sometimes i'll just lay in my pajamas all day and stay in bed because it's what i think is best for me But it's not what's best for me I started going to concerts alone and I can think of  people in the past  months that I've made acquaintances with and one really great friend Meeting others in real life is spontaneous and unexpected so don't think that life will be like this forever You will get to know someone and i bet you there are plenty of people who would love to be your friend I really mean it         
Once I'm home from my christmas break I will be going to my regular doctor at the university clinic about it I hope my life improves because it is pretty shit right now I only started drinking heavily within the last  months or so Everything just fell apart all at once and very rapidly I had my apartment flood lost my couch and rug lost all of the deposits had to fight for weeks to get out of the lease while being essentially homeless lived on couches my long term girlfriend and I split up rather abruptly and then I had the worst semester of my entire academic career So hopefully all I can do is go up                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
I'm trying to stay PMO free until my 21st in around  days If I can do it for that long I can do it forever Here we go                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
IRL I have met many wonderful people and a few that were complete sociopaths The issue is that sociopaths are like black holes everyone gravitates towards them and nobody can escape their grasp Most social circles have one at their core not unlike most galaxies It's not that good people don't use the internet Most everyone on the internet is faceless It's hard to feel shame when one knows that they are anonymous It's even harder to feel empathy for someone who is anonymous A certain awareness is required to step back and realize that everybody that one interacts with on the internet is a living breathing human being                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
Damn you know what's funny My dad is the same apart from that he decides to drink himself to sleep most nights and forget about me Happy New Years btw just struck  for me over here Anyways you're dad and his friend seem to be dicks you do not need to worry about being too nice at this point if you Dad and his mate were drunk or theyre just arseholes don't stand for that bullshit If you let it slide then it won't stop most likely It might be hard to speak up at first but trust me it's worth it If this happened once and nothing similar has happened since then don't worry at all mate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
I want to die too I have a bottle of xanex Ugh there's a little part of me that says things WILL get better and I don't wanna miss it Try and have a little hope and hold on to it That's what I try to do                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
 feeling like a burden etc I wish I could remember which celebrity gave this anecdote They were either on Oprah or in O Magazine or something years ago She said she used to be really self conscious when she'd go see friends and they were comforting someone her first thought was Oh man what did I do to make them feel so bad  Then one day she realized that that level of self consciousness was actually kind of self absorbed Why should she assume that another person's pain or bad mood was because of her In this particular instance the friend's mother had died and people were consoling her but the narrator just assumed it had to have been because of something she did and that prevented her from being a comfort to the friend or having TRUE empathy That really struck me When our primary focus is always on worrying about how we affect others we're making it too much about ourselves and ironically that's not TRUE empathy Therefore being overly self conscious is actually being narcissistic It's much kinder and empathetic to approach someone with no preconceived notions at all and assume nothing The good news is it's also kinder and more empathetic toward ourselves

I know a guy who talks so slow and a lot of people thinks he is stupid He looks like a human version of a sloth so slow in his movements and that all One time when he had to present a class in highscool he couldn't handle it and ran away from the class It was so weird no one laughed when he left and neither when he came back He was my friend and i knew him kinda good he was intelligent more intelligent than a lot of people but when i was talking wit him i felt like he never knew what to say so i guess is so like your situation He writes great too and explains everything in detail when writing I don't think you or him are stupid maybe you are not good at being spontaneous and talking I'm kinda like that except that i can talk about deeper things with people but is something that you don't really want to do until you know that person for a long time or because the theme of conversation cames naturally Practice makes things better Also getting checked by a profesional helps a lot Hope things get better for you                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
You cant save her She is also already in an relationship Even if she does get away its best to be in therapy for at least a year before beginning another relationship She has to save herself No one is coming to do it for her She had an opportunity to have him removed when the cops were there and chose not to Thats not uncommon but it shows she isnt ready to leave yet It can take years for that to happen You cant be more invested in her then she is in herself I recommend you check out thehotline org and look for the resources for Family and Friends And be very careful                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
In a weird way it makes me feel better people here can understand what I'm feeling I might have gone through with it by now otherwise                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
I'd rather stay in and watch Three Stooges and Twilight Zone episodes but I'm going to my friend's party I have no inclination or temptation to drink The last time I drank this past Monday has supplied me with lasting memories of the negativities to keep me off forever I hope But one day at a time I'll show up with my mug of tea and snacks to share tonight and probably head back home before midnight I'll see you all here or tomorrow sober again                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Jup I hate it because I've become rather good at getting the few daily attacks i get to go away by breathing slowly and thinking it's only anxiety  nothing bad is happening But in the middle of the night you cannot always think rationally for the first few minutes when you wake up so here the pounding heart or offset reality feeling of anxiety still can get it's claws in me And then the downward spiral thinking of how my day at work is gonna suck because of lack of sleep pretty much ensures that I will not get any more sleep Aaahhh The joys of anxiety I'm hoping  will treat me better anxiety wise

While this doesn't really apply in this situation getting into someone's personal space can be an effective tool in social situations

Sounds like you handled it well and your feelings are totally understandable Just wanted to add though that it is possible your friend is really trying to be smart protective and do the right thing even though he is obviously getting it wrong Only you know if it's that or if he's really an insensitive fucker But I'm sure it will be obvious in time With you over here

http store steampowered com app  is what I use Physics is one of those things I fear talking to people who actually are qualified to talk about because my comprehension of it is very rudimentary at the current time                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
r all people keep asking questions and giving advice are too vague They also tell us to do things that we are unable to do because we're socially inept or that we failed attempting to do If you're going to try to help us at least be specific and don't attack the people who need help

I seriously thought of this place as more of a BPD support group than a BPD discussion group Believing the former inspirational quotes and pet pictures and stuff would be acceptable as people support eachother that way If it's the latter then I feel like I just lost an emotional support but I suppose there will be more knowledge related posts which might be helpful

That's very good that you are scare so you will not do anything that couldn't be undone Just a few days and you will be back to normal again                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
its probably a joke                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
If it's any consolation to you I went to bed early on NYE In fact the holidays seem to have passed me by with the only noteworthy event being my virulent head cold                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
God it's the worst Especially if you're like me and are prone to constantly worry about your health I've gotten better about it but the thought is always in the back of your head that it could be something more serious like ALS or Parkinson's Of course I know it's rare as shit but that's just another example of my own irrational fears I've been dealing with a twitch in my left eye for like  weeks and it flares up when I get nervous It's starting to ease up though so thank god for that Hopefully our twitches will disappear for the new year and we can celebrate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
I'm worried about a sip of champagne at midnight with the group I am celebrating with I will be drinking craft sodas and tonic waters all night but I will get a glass of champagne around   I am driving and have no problem telling people I don't want to drink tonight but I'm worried there will be some pushing like it's just a glass of champagne My plan is to hold it and put it down right away after midnight I'm sure I can do it so I'm going to not be drinking tonight with all of you                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
My interests tend to come and go in phases I've been getting into philosophy and history recently I'm floating around this theory that Nietzsche unknowingly set the climate for WW1 and WW2 The German troops apparently were printed copies of Thus Spoke Zarathustra in large quantities to read in the trenches Of course his works were heavily edited and tailored to fit the Nazi agenda by the time WW2 started to kick into gear It's always interesting when some new age thing wants to twist up the past in support of itself I get a big chuckle out of the selection of Bill O' Reilly books available to my greedy capitalistic hands

I have a somewhat long story that I posted last night in a different forum It is anxiety related so I figured it wouldn't hurt to share it here as well I am new to Reddit and this thread so I look forward to looking through it and finding some stories and talking to some people who I can relate to about anxiety Happy New Year I just had a pretty crazy  hours and I wanted to share it Basically I had a breakdownand then a breakthrough The backstory is my life but I will try to keep it as short as I can so hopefully people read this I have never posted something so personal but if even one person gets something from it I will consider it worth it Right now it is  pm on    and if this is not the best thing that has happened to me in  tomorrow is going to be amazing Technically the last part of it happened about an hour ago and I just decide to write about it It began at  when I was dragging my ass out of a funk and trying to take it to yoga Rewinding a little bit I just arrived home on Wednesday night today is Friday from going home to MD for Xmas Long story short my parents had a bitter divorce over  years ago and still cant be in the same room so Xmas usually sucks I wasnt going to go home but based on some realizations in prior months I decided I wanted to go home not for Xmas but to talk to my parents about how their resentment towards one another affected me I could go on and on with examples of ways they have hurt one another and I probably will write a longer edition because it seems therapeutic but thats not for now I convinced my parents to meet and so I went home for the holidays for that I was contemplating not going up until the last minute and cancelled my uber to the airport twice My anxiety has been reduced for much of the year but started to get very bad when I began making plans to ask my parents to do this Lets just say it wasnt easy It took a lot of emotion out of me having to come up with  different ways to tell each of them how this affected me what bothers me and ultimately to agree to it By the time it came around I was having such a tough time I told myself I needed to power through it and at least try so I
The thing is if I wanted to talk to a girl social anxiety kicks in if I had the courage to talk ill be worries if she is too religious that she will call the authority for sexual harassment or if she is a gold digger she'll laugh at me for being too nice polite I'm more to compliment than to say a pick up line or a joke

I knew quite a few people that went to school while still technically in a relationship back home All of them broke up eventually and most were worse than if they had just done it to begin with after high school For example guy meets girl at school guy starts liking girl current HS girlfriend gets wind and thinks guy is cheating on her they fight she makes everything more dramatic than it should be guy breaks up with HS girlfriend but shes still way too clingly guy can finally move on and enjoy college I know of  people whoever who dated on and off through college and they met in highschool they probably broke up a good  times but ended up getting married they are not what i would call a good marrage More trouble than its worth IMO save yourself now

Granted this is easier said than done but I think you need to pack your shit and sleep on a friend's couch until you can get yourself situated At this point what is the point in staying If you're unhappy not upsetting the applecart is not a good reason to stay

It's possible that you are either bored or tired of same food Why not try new and different food that you never tried before Try stopping being picky Trust me you will like new foods with your tastiness

Thanks i appreciate you sharing your experience It is really hard on me but at the same time based on his behavior it does seem like he is genuinely suicidal He called me from work and told me he was going to just go leave and kill himself He said he was just calling me so I could tell his family he was sorry When I asked him how he planned on doing it he said he wouldn't tell me because he didn't want me to try to stop him I begged him to let me pick him up from work so I could take care of him I feel like an awful person because for a brief moment I felt like I should have just ignored him and let him do it if he really wanted to But if i don't stop him then I will feel responsible                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
 be successful This is the key I struggle with it myself I don't want to be successful I HAVE to be successful But what is success Try to ask yourself what YOU want what are YOUR goals What if nobody was judging if anything was possible Whats your personal success gonna be You are adequate You are worth it I like you just the way you are

 u alphasfa wanted to comment but couldn't so here is their PM Hi there Muslim here I ended up on your post while browsing through new This one caught my eye and I clicked on it Decided to check it out I wouldn't be surprised you don't like Islam After all you've only seen the radical side of it Now you've only mentioned two points in your post so I'm just gonna peacefully explain them as well as I can First of all you mentioned the part that says kill all non believers That part is TRUE Yes it is BUT what people fail to see is context This was said during a war Not before the war not after the war During the war Which means specifically kill THIS army That army is long dead now And afterwards Quran ordered Muslims to no longer disturb any non Muslims To them their religion and to you  yours Now if certain extremist groups atheists and Muslims both take all this in the wrong context that's not Islam's fault That being said we discuss the issue of Muhammad S A W W and his wife They lived in a desert  years ago in the scorching heat and lack of food They were completely different people physically For example if you compare someone living in the mountains they'll have stronger lungs and legs than someone who lived in a seaside city all their life Just like that girls at that time hit puberty very very fast Lifespans weren't very long average age was  People matured and died earlier Aisha R A married Muhammad S A W W but lived with her parents until she was ready to go live with her husband She stayed his wife until he passed away She was a best friend to him and he was to her Since I am Muslim now what's my duty Shall I kill every non believer I see and marry a man asap Not at all I have many Christian friends and a boyfriend at the age of  I'll marry whenever I am ready The average life expectancy is   years now I have a long time to decide what I wanna do with my life Islam isn't a bad religion It's basic concept is love belief and brotherhood But if you take it out of context or if you judge every Muslim in the world based on jerks like ISIS that's not very fair Please feel free to ask me anything you want I'm willing to explain and the reply for anyone interested I judge no one on anything besides their behaviour I just really don't like Islam Thank you for the response and the clarification on the

From Wikipedia https en wikipedia org wiki Auditory processing disorder is an umbrella term for a variety of disorders that affect the way the brain processes auditory information  Individuals with APD usually have normal structure and function of the outer middle and inner ear peripheral hearing However they cannot process the information they hear in the same way as others do which leads to difficulties in recognizing and interpreting sounds especially the sounds composing speech nbsp I am not a doctor so take my attempted explanation ELI5 with a grain of salt From what I understand people with APD hear you just fine their ears work well but their brain may have some trouble interpreting what they heard especially speech You know how some people can't understand you at all when you talk to them in clubs or loud environments They may have some degree of APD they are actually hearing what you're saying but their brain has trouble differentiating your words from the background noise I suppose it's like needing glasses You know it's a tree you see the little leaves even if they're blurry blobs But you may not be able to figure out what kind of tree it is exactly because it's all blurry My uneducated mind thinks APD is more of a spectrum I've used that particular example because you'll find a ton of people that can't understand speech very well in loud environments even when the words are clear myself included I have also a hard time with phone videoconference conversations unless they're high quality not that unusual either

 Some American girls are spoiled The percentage of girls that fit the behavior you're describing is very small but unfortunately they dominate our perception because they make the most noise You could just as easily say the same thing about guys having ridiculous standards having tons of sex etc These types of guys exists and are just as common as girls like how you describe they are known as Chads But they are in the small minority just like the girls There are a ton of girls who aren't spoiled who are virgins and don't spend a ton of time out and about having fun Just like us Unfortunately we interact with this kind of person less than the kind you describe which leads to the imbalance in our perception we see a lot more of the spoiled type with ridiculous standards than the down to Earth type                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
If she just watches the first half an hour alone she'll get most of the important aspects of ADHD Maybe just ask her to watch 35m She might then watch more because it's quite engaging i think

 I wish I found this sub reddit when I was  years old Hell it didn't even exist at that time I discovered porn before I discovered masturbation No shit nobody ever told me something about masturbation let alone explained it to me I remember one day  years old playing with my dingdingdo while watching porn when I all of a sudden came all over my hand and pants From that day on i just went downhill I got really into porn especially into the 'big ' fetish Fapping to porn everyday from then on Just like masturbation nobody every said anything about porn to me It was just there and it was amazing Nobody ever told me it would fuck up my brains Not that my life is bad now but I do feel like I kind of wasted some years I'm super happy if I see young guys  years old  years old posting here Brings great warm to my heart that these boys see the problem before their super years begin I'm  years old I'm part of the first real wave of 'free    HD extreme porn whatever' victim wave It's up to us to warn the younger generation I'm glad to see kids find there way to here

For so long I had that voice that said no but I ignored it because the momentary pleasure seemed amazing to my young mind I grew cold to the voices in my head I felt nothing no shame However recently something struck me like an arrow to the back The very thought of porn was disgusting women are defiled to the amusement of thousands of men I cannot look at the misery of mankind and enjoy it anymore I see the pornography for the devil it is The beauty of women body and soul is immense In return we men have been giving them broken shells of who we ought to be No longer Let's build outselves into the solid rocks we were born to be                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
This Not to say your current friend is a terrible person but there were many people who I was friends with because we drank together When I stopped drinking some of my friends were still there and we still enjoyed hanging out with each other and some of my friends moved on and that's okay It can be tough and some of your closest friends may not be there when the dust settles but focus on you right now and the friends that stick will understand that and still work to include you in what they're doing and some of it may involve others drinking but a lot of it will not Good luck stay strong One day at a time and NYE is a hard day for everyone

If that statistic is accurate then I'm one of the  that hasn't relapsed I don't take the first drink If we don't take the first drink we won't relapse What's the point I have a wonderful happy sober life that I wouldn't trade for anything I couldn't stay sober though without lots of help especially in the early years Therapy and AA helped me when I struggled                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Shame about the pet but what's important to do is focus on small achievable goals to get to a point where you're satisfied with your life Like for example try waking up early and making yourself breakfast This might seem like a small trivial thing but isn't everything Maybe once you see that you can do things then you can start to make more and more goals And since you've found reddit I trust you know your way around the internet well enough to get help and support when you need it

Have you done DBT two truths can conflict You can accept the situation and not be willful against it but also believe it needs to be changed radical acceptance is not the same as condoning or agreeing with it Furthermore mindfulness means that while you may have to accept something happening now doesn't mean that you have to experience it in the future I had been just discharged from hospital when I was made by the government to attend a job agency appointment There was nothing I could do about attending the appointment I had to accept that if I wanted to be paid I had to go If I got angry about it the only person being harmed would be me If I didn't go the only person being harmed was me However accepting that had to happen does not mean it i agree with it or accept that it ALWAYS has to happen I was mindful that at the right time dbt skill effectiveness I could speak about it in my advocacy work and talk about how wrong it was i had to experience that dbt skill personal values

It is common You mention she went and diagnosed by someone Is she on medication and going for therapy Also what is her opinion on what is happening Accepting or denial Try and take care of yourself as the roller coaster of emotions can be taxing

Welcome and don't feel shy to post I have found this group to be the most supportive people ever I am sorry you are feeling sad and isolated I too drank because of social anxiety but then without any inhibitions I acted like a complete ass and have embarrassed myself and family and friends more times than I can count I refuse to live like that anymore If you are able I'm reading the Naked Mind and it's really helping me                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Sounds to me like you are having trouble with your real world problems and keep reverting to escapism in order to avoid the negative feelings of reality The fact that you say I can't explain but I have to play something      means you are  using video games as a mind numbing drug to take you away from your issues You have trained your brain to the point where gaming becomes a reflex when the going gets tough which is a habit you must break now Your grades are suffering your life is suffering and your future will be a bad one Face your issues instead of running I would highly recommend you start a small goal which is something like 14 days of no gaming This includes no gaming no watching videos streams on gaming no gaming message boards etc Fight through the withdrawal symptoms and learn to be at peace with yourself through boredom There are many other hobbies you can have that do not have the addictive properties of gaming

Someone else mentioned clonodine it's just a blood pressure med but it has this amazing effect of making a lot of the withdrawal symptoms go away Just keep in mind that it will lower your BP quite a bit and you might get light headed or passout when you stand up I should add a little alcohol can help with symptoms as well but don't do this for more than a few days After day   it's all downhill Keep in mind that when you workout it makes your body produce endorphins which are very similar to morphine think endo morphine and can help symptoms a lot Good move on getting off the opiates Those things are just evil Oh one more thing about clonodine it's not controlled and is not addictive There is zero abuse potential If you take it for a long time and suddenly quit taking it you may have high BP for a little so be sure to not take it too long and if you do taper off and watch your BP Most patents don't have issues with this but I figured I'd mention it anyhow Any questions feel free to PM me

Basically its just the extremeists saying to kill non believers i dont believe killing a non believer is the correct thing to do and majority of the muslims believe this too Also i wouldnt go near anyone below the age of  majority of the time child marriages happen mostly in third world countries is because of culture not religion although i did hear once someones finishedwith puberty theyre considered an adult but again majority of people wouldnt touch a child in that way its the same with most muslims just a few that do and i find them disgusting                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Thank you for sharing I fear the same for myself I am going to try this year to be sober or at least make a solid effort I know the ramifications of getting caught drinking I just have to keep telling myself the penalty of drinking and getting caught far out ways whatever good time I might miss Maybe I'll just be the DD for my friends Be something helpful for them                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
Doing that right now Once you are drunk it isnt that difficult but alcohol always goes both ways                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
I don't think anyone's really worried about the current American government doing anything malicious to ordinary people at least it's more what future governments could do with that sort of power Look at North Korea or China We've got to try to fail safe ourselves against governments as much as possible because tyranny could ensue They could use it as a way to have the upper hand in all sorts of situations as well though Knowing where your political opponent is or what an important person is doing is gonna make you one step ahead of them which could help to keep quite corrupt people in power for longer But I agree I couldn't give a fuck if they're reading this right now What a boring job that must be

I don't understand how you can make those assumptions Are you saying that people that are very religious make FALSE sexual assault allegations Not all women are bad or have evil intentions Just like not all men are bad Trust your instincts whether they are a good decent person or not

I'm no medical professional and I guess everybody's different but my experience quitting cold turkey from averaging half a bottle of whiskey every night for over a year edit and a bit less for years before that quitting  days ago has been very calm Granted that's equivalent to about   shots so perhaps less than you but some nights I did manage to down a   of a bottle I'm a skinny guy so it tended to hit me kinda hard Since I quit I have been sleeping a lot practicing self soothing techniques for my anxiety found via Google and journaling my feelings whenever I get upset I drink a lot of water and try to eat healthy sometimes I just stare at the walls but I know as long as I don't drink it doesn't really matter what I do within reason I hope that helps                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
The truth is there are some things we cannot unsee what you choose to do when you think about it is what matters

There is no reason to feel any anxiety or fear because you're giving up nothing There literally isn't a single thing you enjoy right now that you can't enjoy without stinking like Marlboros and spending hundreds of dollars per month while ruining your health and co stanly interrupting your life It takes a lot of time money and mental energy and constantly puts stress on your body When you quit you will go through a couple days of discomfort and a few weeks of mental challenges and then it's all over If you continued smoking you would go through routine withdrawals multiple times per day for the rest of your life Being a smoker is much much harder than quitting You will do it this time and you're never going to regret it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
I think the biggest mistake I made was ignoring my anxiety It's sort of a natural response to push back negative thoughts and emotions Perhaps our culture is partly to blame because we've idealized happiness in a sense and are never taught how to manage negative feelings when they inevitably arise You're expected to just forget and relax and it'll all work itself out but of course it never does It's something I wish our educational system would do for young people because it certainly would've helped me out if I knew what anxiety was and how to deal with it from a young age Could help so many people Anyway I hope your anxiety eases up and you have a good new years My new years resolution is to stop worrying so much We'll see how that works out                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
I'm a normie and I don't get any pleasure out of bringing people down Those people bullying you are probably losers themselves trying to make themselves feel better Don't let internet trolls bring you down they don't know you Take everything they say with a grain of salt

I hope you have a good new year too You are right if you surrender now you will never know what you might miss There will be good things and not so good things Yes the new things will be met by you but there is a chance that you could make a new friend or two Nobody can tell us exactly what is going to happen But the chance that it will be good is always there

No an Alpha is someone who is already dominant the one trying to BECOME alpha is beta However doing thing to keep yourself Alpha isn't beta it is defending your position Look at a wolf pack there is always the Alpha of the pack and he remains the leader until he dies becomes to weak to lead or is defeeated by another alpha or beta depending how you look at it then the new wolf becomes the alpha                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Oh no it's fine I don't mind questions When I have an episode like the one I described it does impact me as I do get rather violently ill I often joke that I would force it upon myself during my high school years to get out of class But yes it's quite constantly there especially in the last few days hence I had to bring it somewhere I don't imagine myself dying though it's more the 'after I'm dead' that is the main body And it's only myself I mean of course I worry about others but that's nothing different from the average person                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
First of all I'm honored to have a impactful and mindful conversation with you I have read your passages and I will indeed take the proper steps to critically think and formulate my thoughts are under them Again you have showed me very interesting views that im grateful that you shared My experience comes from a different culture east that made a challenging effort for myself to compare both adequately and objectively And I can get a hint of how the grass isn't always greener on the other side Thank you                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
I don't even know why but this really made me smile At the end of the day we are all different and different things make us happy Being happy is really the only thing that matters i think                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Kudos for  days I needed lots of support in early sobriety A therapist rehab education outpatient and involvement in AA helped me handle cravings and the tough times Eating something sweet helped me with cravings too as did doing something physical I hope you have the support you need and deserve I didn't think it was fair to put the responsibility for my sobriety on a family member so I found it elsewhere Have a great new year                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Thank you Good luck I forgot to mention both married and have other kids as well I now have a big unique family As long as you guys can stay civil and both keep the child first It will be okay Also I loved having young parents I always felt like they understood me better than my friends parents understood them Almost like a Gilmore Girls esque thing Lol But more my dad and me female                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
I'm curious Which country do you live in and what is making it fall apart                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
 continued For instance with advocacy Do you yell at the bureaucrat just following the rules or do you follow the right channels filing complaints and talking to politicians to change the rules You are accepting that this situation is the way it is but you're also taking action If the quality of the mental health ward is bad do you throw eggs at the building and telling everything they're horrible people who should die or do you use facts and figures presented in a calm manner and suggest what could be better you're accepting the situation and taking action

Clearly killing yourself isn't going to solve your families problems If not make it harder for your wife Can you imagine having your child grow up without a dad How your wife will have to tell her child one day that life was too hard to handle and that he chose his way out I hope you live on my man It's always a moment of pain for a life of glory and you're clearly going through that pain stage

Hi Same here I didn't even have anything I can do but still it feels bad I live in the middle of nowhere so i'm not hearing any noises outside but I bet it feels horrible But remember it's ok to be not doing anything special I'm really not the right person to tell you this cause I'm feeling sad too right now but I want to try cheer you up try to make you happier i'm not sure of my language I'm not sure what to say to you but try not feel bad cause of your decission If you feel not going anywhere it maybe is the best to be home then Think would you have had fun really if you decided to not go Or if you really feel you want to go is it too late yet There is still people out there if you really want to celebrate with others I really hope you would feel better tonight It's a hard evening to be depressed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Thank you for that information I appreciate your response                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
I hate to rain on your parade but adoption is a real crapshoot I've know a few who had a great time with their adoption they are adults now but I know a literal sea of ppl including my wife who had a pretty shitty time with adoption If the adoption is within one's family like an uncle or aunt adopting it might be good But random strangers Even if they are OK ppl its still very difficult for the child in the BEST of circumstances ie stable good parents So it is an option of course but it is NOT without issues And lets not even talk about shitty adoption agencies Keep it in the family if at all possible unless one's family is even worse

Oh I can see how that would be aggravating I wouldn't want to tell you to change or give vague advice that amounts to 'be different' And I certainly wouldn't want to attack you One thing I might offer is self compassion I see a lot of hurting people in here who are likely harder on themselves than others are on them Nobody deserves to be spoken to the way many people here seems to speak about themselves Don't believe everything you think A thought isn't a truth it's a suggestion that you can chose to give validity or not Mindfulness meditation and cognitive behavioural therapy were very helpful in teaching me to accept myself and my thoughts If you are depressed anxious and frequently find yourself thinking negative things about yourself I'd highly suggest you look into it could change your life like it did mine

I'm made myself familiar with it via research but going on day  tomorrow I think it's pointless to try to obtain I know that exercise is the biggest thing I've never been happier than when I was a workout freak it's just tough to re establish that routine when your brain is all funky For me I know it's the answer though Other than that I'm super into vitamins supplements nutrition but I have no idea if it really helps or not It's almost like a side addiction of mine

I feel that by you coming here and writing this post which really must have been a difficult thing to do that despite how awful you feel and justifiably so that you still have some semblance of hope left despite how small it may be You speak about your child with love that you want to be there for her that you want to be a good father Am I right to think this Because of you can absolutely do this It may not be easy but it's certainly achievable You comment about 'being past the point of saving' jumped out at me quite a bit mostly because I can really empathise with this thought process Everyday you see things stay the same sometimes get worse and any hope you have of wrestling back control of your life seems to dwindle It can be a very vicious cycle Can I ask what you do to fill your days I often found that just finding a little purpose each day can help definitely not make everything better but begin down that path I really do hope attempt to take the steps to recovery the fact you have gone to therapist's and meetings tells me you're strong as getting help for such a difficult problem is an extremely brave thing to do I'd would be happy to talk further if you like

Sounds like the first thing you need to do is get some distance between you and your family Get some independence and discover who you really are I have no idea about your financial position so I understand this might be very hard for you There's a saying you cannot love anyone until you love yourself And this isn't mean in an arrogant way You need to be able to trust your own decisions and not worry if things don't pan out because that how life works You win some you lose some You're still young but life is too short Figure out what exactly you aren't happy with in your life and change it

Civilian fixed wing pilot checking in here I just want to say something that probably goes without saying but I think the bigger takeaway from your story than the usefulness of a stopwatch should be to not put yourself in a low fuel situation like that It may be totally different for you rotary folk but at my flight school we were warned many times about get there itis  and your story sounds like a case of that Taking off with less fuel than you calculated you'd need is asking for trouble not to mention you had a student with you too And six minutes of fuel five miles from the airport Maybe it's different for heli pilots because you can put it down more easily in a field or whatever but still six minutes fuel Maybe the better deployment of the stopwatch would be before making the decision to get in an aircraft that you know to be under fueled                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
So what are you doing to improve this situation which is so intolerable to you Applying for jobs so you can be independent Registering for online classes if you can't handle attending college in person Talking to your guardian s about what you need from them that you feel they aren't providing No one is going to be able to help you unless you can articulate what concrete things you want You don't even seem to be able to articulate what's wrong much less what help you need how do you expect your father to be able to do anything useful

TBH that guy doesn't sound like such a good friend to me Maybe he's more a drinking buddy or party friend Either way I am sorry that you are feeling hurt and left out that is one of the worst feelings and I can understand why you're pissed I would be as well I really have no good advice but to say that I think you are certainly entitled to feel the way you do and I think that recognizing it's a trigger and still not drinking is really strong and smart of you P S I'm chugging a coconut La Croix what flavor is yours

The way I've improved myself was through my  New Year's Resolution Never say no to invitations You'd be surprised at the many opportunities that one misses by being afraid to make a move in life I've experienced many more new things than ever before Foods from around the world finally went fishing finally made new friends beyond my small social circle finally reached my academic goals and now I find myself starting a new relationship after a couple years of being single Just follow your heart and happiness will find you

Your question is completely irrelevant and besides We know because we do not lack self awareness I have been told I am not a good looking person and that I seem to have an attitude problem Whatever that means So there Your question has been answered

Personally I've known people who spent several thousand on an engagement ring and always thought that was insane My wife and I both saw eye to eye on this which was nice From our perspective the money is better spent on a future home I ended up spending about  on a custom ring and we were both very happy with the result Some good advice I've received regarding marriage in general is happy wife  happy life Is your objection to the ring purely on financial practical grounds What is the root of her desire for one I suspect there is a comfortable middle ground that will make you both happy

I don't need to know him to know that he's not a good friend Friends lift us up when we are down support us include us and love us They don't go out of their way to exclude us because of a healthy new lifestyle If he were truly a friend he would have asked him outright and had an honest conversation about it As someone who's struggled with so called friendships through the years I completely relate and identify with OP That feeling of being left out and excluded and like you don't belong brings me right back to those feelings I had before I got sober Obviously OP is rather upset by it all too It's a shitty feeling and we don't deserve to feel that way from someone who we thought was a good friend                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
At the study start participants with more sense of purpose earned more and had accumulated more wealth even after factoring out the influence of personality and life satisfaction Well there's a giant red flag for a poorly controlled study The possibility is quite strong that people who come from more money and therefore have more options in life have a greater sense of purpose and direction than those who grow up poor with limited possibilities Participants should have been matched for income and family background at the outset

In should have done what kind of things do you mean I think I feel some of what you're saying How do you decide what hill has to be tackled Is there a lot of structure in your life to make the choices for you Everything takes some effort to get started even pleasurable things right so the question I get stuck with a lot of the time when I'm not absolutely forced to do one thing or another is to find the path of action where the effort reward ratio is optimal for that day It looks like lot of FALSE starts and fumbling until something in my brain catches on to the activity and starts moving along in time

Not drinking tonight Not even going out Spending the night on the couch with my dogs Not drinking no matter what I have no issues with going to bars but the people I was thinking about going out were getting bottle service No need for me to be there for that I'd just be bored since the guy buying the bottles is a tool bag

I'm sorry that happened Stuff like that mostly from really well meaning people happens all the time and thanks to our friend conformation bias it seems even more common when we look for it Sometimes however people might not mean well and be trying to make some sort of indirect point Either way full steam ahead I had an experience of someone meaning well and pissing me the fuck off that I recall often When at dinner with a friend when I was still only about a year sober the waitress came over and asked if id like to hear the beer list My friend cut me off and exclaimed oh no  He's not allowed to drink  I wasn't embarrassed by my sobriety I was embarrassed that my friend felt he had to babysit me Like it was only through the constant guarding of others that I managed to scrape out a year already dodging bullets every day Wanna know what I did I calmly said that I was an adult and could do whatever I wanted I asked the waitress to hear the list I ordered a beer I thought sounded good Then I let the beer sit there on the table all dinner like a big hot pile of shit He kept uncomfortably looking at it and I didn't think about it twice Because I chose not to drink it just as I had managed to do for a year before and three years since We live in a world full of liquor if proximity or availability is the only thing keeping us sober we've already relapsed Stay strong

I thought it would be uplifting because the whole thread is full of stories There's a guy who has a decent amount of upvotes describing how he is going to meet up with his family and his dog to celebrate so I don't see how exactly my post would be seen as assholish I don't know what this sub is TRUE But if people are triggered by the mere statement that I'm going to a restaurant to celebrate than this sub is truly way lonelier than I though Truly saddening                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
That verse is specific to one particular battle the Battle of Badr It is a battle in which a large Meccan army traveled to make war on the muslims It is not a catch all verse designed to say kill all non believers Even if you read a bit after that verse you will find some more information that refutes your understand Verse   If you disbelievers seek the victory the defeat has come to you And if you desist from hostilities it is best for you but if you return to war We will return and never will you be availed by your large company at all even if it should increase and that is because Allah is with the believers Even near the end of the Chapter verse  lays it pretty bare And if they incline to peace then incline to it also and rely upon Allah Indeed it is He who is the Hearing the Knowing

Immunity to stomach bugs is short lived but a week later is fine In a couple months you will have lost your immunity                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
For me I had to force myself to go out more I spent two months where everyday I hung out with someone even though I was working  jobs at the time I tried to not make it the same person all the time I would reach out to old friends A lot of it was me having to go meet them And every time I went out with friends I made it a goal to make one new friend Just to get my extrovert back I also made myself exercise And I HATE exercising I didn't do much about  mins This may sound weird but I would put in my calender a future alerts privately around a month out with something motivational from things like get you shit together or who did you meet today reminder what can you do today to further your career I did them so randomly that sometimes they would even take me by surprise I did one like a year out once saying by this time you better have a better job and be living on your own and strangely enough I had It made me feel really good My inner voice is mean so my reminders were usually mean like my inner voice left them Lol                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Now hold on a minute You can't do that without finishing your job here as you signed the contract when you were born What do you mean you were'nt conscious being Well who cares Your mom and dad put the sign there for you

I have both Some days they feed off each other and make life nearly impossible Most days I'm exhaused after work but apparently I refuse to give up At least eventually The power of shame anger and self hatred at its finest                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
The idea of a woman wanting to be intimate with me seems very foreign to me too despite it being something I crave

No I only believing in things that can be proven Everything else falls into one of these categories almost certainly likely maybe unlikely impossible The idea of fate as a construct is only one that exist withing the human perspective so from that I can't consider it likely to exist The problem with many religious or faith beliefs is that they rely on the human experience not only being unique but also being at the centre of everything a universe built around it I don't find that very likely in fact I find it near impossible

I used Kratom daily for  years since I was  because I could not imagine feeling happiness from anything but drugs Even when I had gotten clean from it and was exercising daily I still felt miserable It was only when I realized I lacked the happy chems that most people have in normal amounts did I actually get the medication that has allowed me to enjoy life I take a drug that keeps my dopamine from breaking down Welbutrin allowing me more motivation juice to get things done Additionally I take Lamictal which acts as a neurprotectant against the degeneration of brain tissue that depression causes Note that kratom brings pleasure by stimulation of the mu opioid receptors and unfortunately chronic use downregulates these receptors a bad thing when the kind of people that tend to use opioids chronically already have less receptors than average meaning they experience less pleasure in general and have a higher sensitivity to pain The best way to produce natural opioids is through exercise and there is also some evidence to suggest that use of opioid antagonists like narcan in small doses can actually upregulate the receptors Good luck and I recommend you stay away from ssris because they seem to be bullshit

There are all kinds of traditions that people don't care for and don't follow Unfortunately it's concerning that your GF only reluctantly agreed to your opinion with regard to this tradition That tells me that you and she are not on the same page about this and that she places value in having an engagement ring even if you don't If she really does want one I think you ought to gladly get her a ring out of your love for her no arguments no guilt inducing statements etc

Think about it as a victory for your sobriety and not a loss for your social life I stay home on NYE and St Patrick's day specifically to avoid all the trouble and drunken shenanigans that are a byproduct of the celebrations Boring Maybe But it gives me personal satisfaction for keeping with my beliefs and staying sober which is more important to me by a lot

This all depends on the person itself I hate sports games so in a social setting if I was pressured into playing I think I could be able to handle it just fine without relapsing but it is a scary thought to think of But everyone is different Just having a controller in your hands seeing the flashing lights on the screen sitting in a chair feeling comfortable will all trigger signals in your brain that may try and get you to relapse again I will tell you this though when Overwatch came out I tried it a few times and absolutely hated it I was about  months into my no gaming diet and I went over to my friends house for a party They had a few PS4s set up and they were all playing Overwatch They all kept telling me to play and since I already knew I hated the game I figured it would be harmless to play it a few times with them because I knew I wouldn't care about it once the party was over So we played all night and when the party was over I still hated the game The next day I was at Best Buy and while I was browsing the electronics I saw the Overwatch display In this weak moment of mine I thought it might be fun to casually play the game a little bit and learn how to be at least average at it so when I do go over to my friends house again I have something we can all do together and have fun Because even though I disliked the game it was still fun playing all night with them regardless of what game we even played It felt like harmless social entertainment and they all were pretty good at the game so I wanted to fit in better So the first few weeks I casually learned the game There were no issues I played a game here and there I learned a couple of characters and figured I was competent enough to at least keep up with them I wanted to see how good I was though so I eventually tried out ranked to see how I stacked up Well this quickly turned into full blown zombie addiction mode where I proceeded to play   hours a day for the next month Even the game I hated so much got me After this I realized I just can't handle games no matter what                               
 A minimum of  bus journeys a day That um that seems like a lot Where do you live how far are you from the school How much time does this take Where I grew up the school district provided a bus for all students who lived far enough away that they couldn't reasonably be expected to walk have you talked to the administrators at your kids' school Do you have neighbors or friends or family who could be talked into driving your kids to school or failing that bribed

This post right here A old friend of mine who is still actively abusing alcohol tried to tell me my drinking wasn't that bad or I can always just cut down when I first stopped drinking I think when I quit it made him examine his own drinking habits and he didn't want to accept that it was not healthy or normal

I can never seem to be able man up and do that I have to explain to my parents about my phone and I still haven't done that I don't think talking to them about this will come any easier

I'm not sure if your supermarket is the same but when I was working at one managers are around the grocery workers more and have to talk to them more telling them what to do so it might just be exposure The deli department doesn't seem to be visited by managers that much

You wish for success but you focus on the current ground level problems Thats how you solve things Still knowing this did not help me but it still might help you i guess you are much younger than me

Don't listen to these guys They are encouraging you to fuck girls like objects The way I see it that misses the whole point of sex Value the girl for who she is Don't use her beauty for your fleeting carnal benefit                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Ive actually done both myself i had a job while i was at university and it was nice in the bank account and time aspect back then but i only got it because I hated my school and most of the people i knew there wernt people i genuinely enjoyed being around fast forward a year transfered out into a new school and things were great i didnt get a job because I didnt want one at the time and if i had decided to it wouldve been on campus very part time problem was I got a little actually very too far into the drug scene and ended up failing out so take that for what its worth IMO college is all about meeting people and having a good time and if your spending all that money to go to a school  miles away you might as well enjoy it on its own without the job Maybe plan on leaving the job and try and join a bunch of things that interest you on campus or change your living arrangements at school if that might help Hope it works out for you

I think a delusion is a weird thought that you act on in some way It's something you believe at least in part and you can't dismiss it It's probably recurring as well

I want to be a good father you are right but these thoughts I just can't get ride of them and I've been planning this last overdose for a while I know I should get help but I just can't I was actually going to kill myself two days ago but the shoppers got my meds mixed up and I could only get  pills at the time the  pills I hid away that's why I have  days to go until I can get a refill and my days are filled with a co op because when I was younger I dropped out of school because I was so lonely I couldn't stand to be around people not in the sense I hated them but because I would see them laughing and having a good time being normal but anyways I fill my days with co op and going for drives basically blasting music as well                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
I'm right there with you guys just far behind your progress It's been weird being actually sick during withdrawal Sort of a mental fuck Relaxing with meds teas humidifiers and praying for some sleep Watching some CFB now and will be rooting on my Giants at  tomorrow Hoping to get some mental reprieve soon                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
yeah it's just hart to accept that they don't care and that I'm alone

 Fact of the matter is being good looking allows guys to open the door to contact with women that door doesn't even exist most of the time for people without stellar looks If it makes you feel any better the same is TRUE for  of men As a man you have to be extremely good looking before you consistently get positive reactions from girls based on your looks

Hi I'm new too so no worries I started running which helps the most I think I also try to eat fairly decent and to cut down on my caffeine intake when I'm feeling particularly anxious And I make sure I get enough sleep That being said my anxiety is mild to moderate but all these little things together really help to keep it under control Edit I forgot to include this but if you are religious at all I also use prayer to help me stay grounded if I am in a really bad place Meditation is also beneficial I've used meditation and yoga to help me get to sleep at night

Good for you for not drinking and I won't drink with you tonight I faced my coworkers after my shitfaced xmas party by saying sorry I was such as ass the last time we were together I was so surprised by how many people expressed a desire to quit drinking Good luck                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
I think cancelling on the party was a wise decision After the initial withdrawal window usually a few days to a week for me each time I've tried to stop I experienced post acute withdrawal symptoms PAWS months after I did a lot of research on PAWS in the first weeks and now when I'm not feeling that great I don't feel as bewildered as I did in the past Congratulations on making it a week and happy New Year                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Have you tried talking about this with your husband How he keeps getting on your nerves instead of helping you He seems to care as he asks you how you're going but clearly he isn't helping There's nothing worse when you're not feeling well than having someone pestering you like that I agree with the comments below therapy helps Talking about it helps You need to let it out Have you got any friends to whom you could ask for help Also something I discovered last Winter when I was very depressed physical activity is beautiful Run swim do anything just move The chemicals in your brain will do wonders and it'll be great for your health It helps me a lot When it gets too dark in my brain I go for a run and it clears the clouds away Hope this helps Happy new year

I honestly do not think of it as embarrassing one bit If anything you're saving yourself from a cycle of embarrassment if you start to lose not only your sanity but also your friends whether that's through borrowing money lying desperation gambling I'm so glad you've recognized your limits and have made a conscious step in curbing that compulsive feeling to gamble I wish you the best in your  and hope you persevere and grow on this experience I'm sure you'll come out a much stronger person                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
I've quit New Years resolutions For some reason they never work out I accomplish more when I just decide to do it regardless of what time of year it is If I accomplish anything                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Great job the way you handled this crying instead of drinking Well done and be proud of yourself I think you'll be moving on friendship wise when you want to

I absolutely agree with what you said and you are  correct on it For people who want to date meet girls etc India is absofucking shithole unless you compare to middle east camelfuckers I was exactly where you were around a decade ago and I saw no light but I was not depressed I was angry Angry with the cards dealt to me and I rabidly did everything possible to get out and I hopped countries and am settled in US Once here I went crazy going to parties meeting girls dating them fucking them and in the end realized that all of it is meaningless All you need are good friends and a comfortable life You have a head start to me You are very very young Not even finished high school I would give my arm to be in your situation Don't let your hopes fade away You have a very brilliant chance of making it out of India and making it out as its much easier now than  years ago Drop me a message if you need any guidance or help

I know these thoughts I know how much they hurt What brought me peace was this life exists here From the harshest environments to the most docile life exists It doesn't do this because it's easy or because it has a purpose It exists because it CAN There is opportunity and there doesn't need to be a reason Yes things lead to pain But they lead to happiness too Sometimes the two aren't equal You're here because you can be inside that is infinite possibilty inside that is hope Not everything will happen but anything CAN happen If you want to talk more I'm here

For anyone outside of your relationship it's very hard to make a judgement call like this and all they can do is base it on their own personal experiences mixed with your summary above That being said it sounds like she's trying to be as kind as possible while asking you to give her space as she works out her own things she said she needed to get her brain rewired before us picking up where we left off I would honor that and be comfortable that she knows you're there to support her when she needs you but for now give her the space she's requested and proceed with your life

You have all my sympathy for dealing with the UK mental health services They are terrible Have you tried going to the gym or physically getting the anger out Or having a moment for yourself in a nice hot bath How about hobbies Do those calm you You are not a waste of oxygen We humans are pretty bad at dealing with our brain going wrong It's all well and good knowing you have nothing to be angry about when your veins are pumping adrenaline into every muscle If you were your husband wouldn't be asking if you were okay as silly as it is it shows that this super angry person isn't the normal you This is an exception that he still wants to tackle together with you Nobody asks a waste of oxygen did they'll share their burden with them every five minutes Finally don't throw the notion that something in your life is wrong too far away This might be your body's way of telling you in its non verbal way that something is REALLY wrong Usually anger is the extra energy our body gives us to change something that is upsetting to us It might still be that even if the cause might not be obvious to you or something you feel shouldn't be upsetting you My recommendation would be anger writing Next time you feel on edge grab yourself a pen and a journal and let it all out Everything that comes into your head You should be tired but less angry afterwards Then go back to what you have written the next day and see if you can pin point a source or reason

I'm not atheist I'm just anti religion Most of you only believe because the roots were planted in our heads at a young age  years ago our ancestors worshipped pantheons of gods Why Because their community leaders raised them around it Same thing now really and the same behavior is why probably  of young single men in english speaking countries have PMO'd in the previous year compared with maybe  max during the world wars We were exposed to it at a vulnerable age before we knew any better and now we have to find a life without

 i wanna take psychedelics I'm not sure if that's a great idea if you are prone to psychosis I understand that it's your choice do to so but psychedelics can be really dangerous even without schizophrenia

Go to your doc with a list of concerns This is what I did All of them were dismissed for being common explainable things You pay for you doc so really you are the one to choose this The doc will tell you if they believe you need further tests Beyond that don't over do yourself The worry will make you FEEL far far far worse than you really are                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
It isn't easy But there is no formal way it needs to be done Try writing it down just take time and then show them You can do it and it will help                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
You should seek therapy if you aren't in it already Ask your father or your guidance counselor at school about setting it up for you You pay someone to sit and be there for you every week without fail It may seem awkward and stupid at first but over time you will appreciate having someone who knows you and sees you for who you really are With the right therapist you can feel like you're really here and finally gain some acceptance grieve for your sister Maybe you or your dad could have found her earlier and stopped her but if she was really determined she would have just tried again Because you can't control anybody I know what it feels like to be let down by the whole world and to feel like you're all alone happens to me pretty often actually but the truth is you aren't and you know this Make some changes in your life throw out the trash and cling to the good Work on yourself If you're still miserable every single minute then well you can do whatever you want We'll never know if your sister would have smiled again though since she did what she did                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
I am tired of them too My personal experience  I am  y o I have lived in different countries different continents and met all sorts of people Not many people attract me beyond their physical appearance but when somebody does it is a completely different feeling a different type of presence an unmistakable smile that you want to see everyday Yes I have met the right person and she is not with me Only I know what the feeling of what meeting the right person to me is like no one has the right to say I haven't met the right person for me  I definitely love myself much beyond the average person does I eat well I am healthy I exercise I don't drink nor do drugs I am vegan I love nature Yet I am depressed I have had more failures in life than I can bear Loving myself doesn't change that  I know it doesn't fix However not being in a relationship adds to the depression And it gets worse as you get older  I have tried And I have to tell you today people are weirder than ever People are more judgement they are more politicized more attached to their thoughts more narrow mind and more resistant to loving one another Society nowadays is not a welcoming place for a depressed lonely person Honestly I don't have any helpful advice All I can say is that while the loneliness is extremely painful and haunting there will be moments in life when you might ignore it moments in which you might find joy elsewhere I have struggled with this all my life and if I knew a way to deal with it I would not be here

Hi I posted the first pet picture with a title saying I'll never split on her because I know she'll never abandon me or something along those lines and that got the snowball running I feel bad that people are now upset and arguing about this and I'm sorry I am not sure if what I had posted was appropriate or not and it's just really bothering me Because I sincerely understand the mods message here and I agree with it but simultaneously I friggin started the whole pet invasion thing cutest invasion ever may I just say ugh halp                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
I wouldn't say picky Particular is a better word I'm someone who doesn't fall for every girl he sees and at twenty seven have only been interested in maybe five or six girls A problem that people don't seem to grasp is that all humans are creatures of habit We get up and go to the same job and meet the same people go home and go to bed day after dreary day The chances of us actually meeting someone new is severely against us and the chance that if you do that person having any interest in you is also against you That's just the cruelty of reality for us We are all victims of circumstances                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Why do you think there is no room for you

I had this when I was around  years old it creeped the fuck out of me but eventually I got used to it and learned to cope with it I'm sure it'll pass just like it came

Im not sure in the UK but in Australia the two most reliable are The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule ADOS and the Childhood Autism Rating Scale CARS They normally do an IQ test as part of it as usually people with autism will have big contrasts in their scores for different areas They will be above average in one area but below in the next These online tests are a really good indicator however If you score high on a lot of them theres a good chance you have it Also read some books and blogs on autism Only a professional can officially diagnose though Theyll do interviews ask about when you were growing up etc

I've been thinking a LOT about shutting down facebook recently I didn't even wanna be on it to begin with and wouldn't have if i hadn't been dating someone who pestered me into it and had a bunch of terrible friends who convinced her something was wrong with me for not wanting to be on it The downside is that it might make it harder for people to reach me after having been out of contact for extended periods of time which I think it's somewhat useful for Also for people who just know your first name don't know anybody you know and maybe wanna get ahold of you for some reason Aside from that it's pure waste Fuck facebook

i feel almost the opposite sometimes this sub along with r depression has made me realize just how many of us are struggling with similar issues and miserable lives people that don't have depression or suicidal thoughts really can't relate at all                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Noice I'm attempting dark jokes to cope with depression now and it's a little hard but I think I might like it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
I have heard of it working It must be good knowing your partner understands what you are going through Hope all goes well                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
My thoughts go to familial hereditary hypercholesterolemia Your levels are probably in mg dl and they are in a range that could make you a bearer of a gen that causes this especially when you are so young Note that it could still be other reasons for your high levels I do think it's a bit wierd that your mom gives you the results Go to a doctor by your own and tell him about your probably high cholesterol and let your doctor take it from there                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
I wouldn't to be honest it's a trap I only want to see women in reality not the immediate gratification of looking at an image

I'm someone who's dealt with a very modest appetite most of my life Too many carbs will sustain you but they will leave you drowzy and unmotivated I suggest eating meats Something high in protein like chicken or turkey would probably be best The nutritionalist is right though You need to get fruits in your diet to balance out what you've already been taking in The acids in fruit should help breakdown what's already in your stomach and should regulate your stomach acid An apple or two a day could definitely help I wish you the best of luck                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
In medicine we say it like this At a cardiac arrest  the first procedure is to take your own pulse  from The House of God a book by Samuel Shem that is unofficially mandatory reading for med students I find that it's a useful first step and helps me calm myself down anytime I feel anxious about something It's interesting how different industries will discover important concepts and make them part of the culture cool to hear that the military has a version of this too                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
I have heard it is bad for the liver but in very very very very very few cases I've been taking it for a long time and haven't had any issues I'm pretty good at keeping it in low doses I figure as long as you don't drink or anything at the same time it shouldn't be to bad But I agree with your therapist I'm no professional by any means and appreciate your input greatly People who may have liver issues may want to look at some other form of relief

There's a difference between court ordered rehab and wanting to be clean I've been to rehab most people including myself were forced there either by the government court or significant others spouses I've reached a point that I WANT to stop Not because someone is telling me Not because I got in trouble with the law But because I'm sick of what it's doing to my life Actually wanting to stop versus being told to stop is where you separate yourself from that statistic Now your chances of remaining sober are much higher

I personally hate these types of advice because they honestly just make me feel worse rather than help I can't get mad at these people either because I understand that they are just trying to help but don't understand I really don't know if this will help but I have pretty much given up with actively looking for love I realized somewhere along the way that life doesn't center around love If you manage to find love then go for it but don't pressure yourself into looking for the right person If I ever manage to find love again that would be great but if I don't thats fine too

I am by no means a mental health professional but many of the symptoms you describe sound like those associated with schizophrenia I would absolutely discuss this with a psychiatrist

Have you attempted to make any change since last year I admit I'm terrible at this and sometimes I feel like I literally can't but I think that's another part of the condition It turns your reality into hell and then takes away your ability to leave Stay strong friend

I don't think you damaged your brain Current neuroscience has found that simple things like exercise and group therapy can have a profound impact in healing the brain

I grew up catholic and i can definitely relate went to all the catholic schools and all and i am not one for organized religion I consider myself agnostic The Church is fucked up and the fact that anyone can acknowledge it as anything other than brainwashing is just beyond me My father will go as far as to make fun of people who question ANYTHING written in the bible if you dont agree with the church's interpretation of it then your wrong in his eyes and he wont even listen to the other side on that topic Needless to say living with them was and is unfortunately had to move back home a chore If your  college must be a possibility especially for a conservative family So id say wait it out until you can get out and just go to a university that isnt conservative and christian you probably just need a change or something

Ugh the number of shitty things I've done because New Years or St Patricks Day or y'know just Friday We made the right choice tonight for sure                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
In the end cutting is just a coping mechanism It doesn't say anything about you as a person other than that life is demanding one hell of a lot from you right now If you can try your other coping mechanisms first and see if the urge goes away or try getting help with some of the things you are struggling with You would rather hurt yourself than give up even if the world is being a nightmare That makes you strong not weak                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
It's because I'm a terrible person

Sounds like a robot                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
To add to this I am on Day  and I have found my cravings only last a few hours at the most and then I forget and move on to something else Try to remember that you won't feel like you want to call your dealer forever                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Yup I'm  and haven't been in a serious relationship since I was  I tried after it but was feeling kind of emotionally numb afterwards Now I'm just plain scared of a relationship even though I want one so bad I'm so afraid of opening up to someone and sharing my life with them again Not to mention the lack of self esteem and all that from the anxiety                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
You know who I am I'm not sure if I should be more worried about that or what tomorrow is gonna bring                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
I don't necessarily agree with the op but there is some truth in what he is saying Doing too much of anything is bad and you should always try to have balance for all of your goals Music pretty much hijacks your thought process which can be good or bad

It's hard to speak in the  i  on this one I had tunnel vision when I wanted to get sober When I was on day  I was focused on my sobriety not what others were doing If I didn't get invited to a party it was a blessing it meant God was looking out for me                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
According to whom What happened and there is plenty of room for bad people in this world so i bet it's not your case                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
 I know AA doesn't really take the holidays off but in your experience is Al Anon the same Al Anon meetings would follow school closings during bad weather that I do know                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Fair enough It is the worry that is making me feel like shit Wish I could make it stop Though what am I to do if there's something bothering me that I literally have not yet been able to successfully describe

The experiences you had won't go away overnight Change can be tough and you sometimes have to work at it for a long time It will be faster and easier with the help of a good counselor therapist psychiatrist Remember that anxiety is not always proportional to risk The thing to do if you can is to take small risks to recalibrate your anxiety so that you're still afraid of being eaten by a tiger but not afraid of a woman telling you to fuck off Give yourself small challenges every day like saying hello to a stranger or giving someone a genuine compliment When you don't complete your daily challenge forget about it move on When you do reward yourself After a few months you will see progress A tiny bit of progress every day quickly adds up

Loved it I got giggly and excited a lot My parents told me I used to run around the house whenever there is thunderstorms and heavy rain It doesn't help that I'd also go out to play soccer in the rain with other neighbour kids our house was in tropical moonson area                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Alcohol can cause really bad effects when used with Tramadol As long as you didn't take it the same day you took Tramadol you should be good But the symptoms you are experiencing are very similar to overdose side effects of Tramadol such as the dark tarry stool and abdominal pain The dark stool could indicate internal bleeding in your upper intestinal tract I would definitely seek medical attention right away especially if the symptoms worsen Good luck to you mate

 While I don't believe in addiction I do think your drinking is a symptom of some sort of personality disorder As a safety net try naltrexone for a month so you can get ahead of the drinking and focus on what the problem is You could have ADHD for all I know Symptoms range from a total disregard for your health to getting hyperfocused on substances Sucks about the shots What does naltrexone do And why would this lead you to believe I have ADHD                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
After a couple of conversations I attempted to carry out through text I have learned this phone them or wait til you see them in person Texting is one of the worst ways to talk to people It never ends well                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Just because you're alone broke and unemployed doesn't make you scum unless you drown puppies or traffic people or something I don't know the situation with you and your family and friends but just because you're estranged doesn't necessarily mean that they don't care about you even if it's only just a smidge I'm not going to tell you what you should or shouldn't do just to think about the gravitas of what you're planning to do because its not reversible I'm sorry you're in such a shitty place right now

Only take medication when it's necessary If you're having stiffness I suggest stretching post workout and if that doesn't alleviate all issues see your doctor about going to PT to learn good strategies

Thank you What do you think could've caused this to happen I mean with one medication it could be a fluke but it seems like something more I'm gonna see a doctor and all just want to be a bit prepared of what might be causing it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
This is only my experience so take it with a grain of salt please do take the detox seriously but it honestly might not be as bad as you think it will I was drinking that much and sometimes more every day by the time I quit I was at that many drinks for  months a year and didn't have any issues with withdrawals at all It's definitely best to start with medical advice being brutally honest I started by talking to my doctor who referred me to an outpatient clinic and it was the best thing I've ever done for myself Wishing you the best in the new year I hope to hear from you soon that you've come through this and are on the road to sobriety

I would venture to say those folks that made those negative remarks are either in denial themselves or cannot understand where we are coming from Glad you're here

No he doesn't invite us both he invites my boyfriend exclusively and tells him he doesn't want to know anything about me So it's obvious that his ex still has feelings for my boyfriend and my bf is just an a hole trying to make me feel that my reactions are a consequence of my illness instead of his actions

Hey friend I'm sorry that this person in your life is bringing you so much pain and sadness Have you talked to your grandma about how her reactions are affecting you I understand that it isn't something that she can turn off any more than you can turn off your depression but it might be something that you can figure out together

I'm not like that man I'm a very emotional and creative person driven to a deeper understanding of life rather than having it regurgitated to me by organised religion If you want to truly be enlightened learn the ways of Taoism Buddhism Those are spiritual paths of learning not a dictatorship like the Abrahamic religions are

Yeah I guess it's not so much about erasing the negative symptoms entirely but I think of it as learning new healthy coping mechanisms and ways to live with them To think and then act differently not succumbing and getting defeated by them Some medications also just seem to just stop a flood of negative emotions that would otherwise spiral out of control Like on some meds I feel like crying but am physically unable to shed a tear somehow                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Tbh I've been seeing this shit for weeks but didn't notice today was the last day I half assed did it on my phone just now but would have done it more thoroughly if I were near a computer

I think a good question here is this how did it make YOU feel when it happened what do you think about the situation deep down I think one thing you could do is maybe sit down with him and talk about it From what you wrote it seems like he genuinely feels terrible and really misread the situation however I can only give my opinion input based on what I have read Did it make you feel in any way unsafe or violated or give you that creepy gut feeling                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Cool story I am Got off the meds that made me balloon up Changing my diet Already dropped two pant sizes Consulting my doctor about possible PCOS not confirmed but my doc is keeping tabs because I have a lot of the symptoms and I exhibit 1 5 of 3 symptoms his words Taking it slow as I already have sagging loose skin from weight loss and I don't want to look like the Pale Man from Pan's Labyrinth

I honestly don't know When I was  I said I'd kill myself at  if I still never kissed anyone and  if I was still a virgin Here I am at  still kicking I just keep going on somehow                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
If you've previously been diagnosed with schizophrenia or related disorder then yes it's likely a symptom However if you havent then what you're experiencing does not mean you have schizophrenia As jm318 pointed out you could be experiencing that for a pretty wide variety of reasons A doctor will help you sort things out and figure out what's up

It'll be pretty cold I'm in wisconsin which is roughly as north but I'm not sure how the altitude and westward position will affect the temps Hard to say really but the west coast is generally considered to be a good place to be by a large portion of the population If you're liberal or even moderate for your politics you'll likely fit in pretty well too I'm considering schools in that area and the natural landscapes and progressive worldview are big things that draw me to the area

Thank you for your response Any advice on how to talk to them in the morning I feel like my husband's friends might think I am a terribly boring and inconsiderate person I would like to apologise for the way I reacted but I don't feel like I need to apologise for my action of stopping an uninformed use of fireworks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
Agreed We can't expect normies to know everything about what we're going through and what we can and can't handle If I didn't know better I'd probably have the same misconceptions as OP's friend OP is early on in his her recovery so it's totally reasonable to have the reaction he she had but as time moves on and the sobriety days add up situations like this are great teaching moments to let our friends and family in on the truths surrounding addiction and recovery That said I'm sorry you're being left out OP We're all here to celebrate your sobriety with you tonight                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
No I mean that what you're saying is exactly how I feel                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Harvard has a  acceptance rate That doesn't mean a kid with a   good test scores has just a  chance Addiction recovery rates are low across the board But it's not a lottery It doesn't matter if the recovery rate is  or  Whether you make it or not is entirely up to you                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
I'm just gonna chill tonight because I'm exhausted from work I want to go to a party but it's a solid hour away So instead I'm just gonna chill with my bro order pizza and just enjoy my evening Tomorrow is a new day No matter how bad last year was embrace tomorrow even if it's hard I was once told FALSE positive motivation can turn into real motivation It's TRUE Belive in yourself and admit the flaws you have Then slowly build your life to be that way Happy New Years all                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
I see what you're saying and logically it makes sense but some part of me wants the satisfaction of knowing I'm competent enough of a human being to maintain a SO type relationship for a long period of time I'm kind of doubtful that's the case though                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
 However if I want to take a bath instead of a shower the tub fills with scummy water So this means when you fill the tub the water is scummy right out of the tap Is the water in your sink scummy The toilet Fill a water glass with water from the tub's spout and look at it If it's scummy you've got a problem with your water pipe to the tub That's not right Talk to the landlord                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Go to see your doctor and get a referral to a therapist particularly one who practices CBT In the meantime look up CBT strategies and try to refocus when you start slipping Also keep a journal of when you have episodes ie what your doing how your feeling before and after                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
I see I hope it will get a bit easier for you to make friends once you get more comfortable with the language I wish you a lot of luck and a happy

Totally understand You just want a solution and there's this huge temptation to just throw as much as you can get your hands on to the wall to hope something can stick But slow and steady wins the race unfortunately Exercise and generally focusing on building small healthy routines seems to be the only thing I've seen be truly in our own control in regards to pushing us closer to healing Hope you have a great new years as well Hopefully  is better than

As far as wanting to hurt people it's possible you're just really kinky but these thoughts may be an indication of additional mental illness in particular i was reminded of this http www cracked com article   realities life when your brain wants you to murder html you should probably see a medical professional and discuss both issues with them If I haven't explained enough or you just want to talk feel free to pm me

Considering that A You didn't own the property B They didn't know how to operate fireworks and C There wasn't any safety equipment laying around you did the right thing Like if the fireworks detonated and the apartment building not your room but the building itself caught on fire well that won't sit too kindly considering all the terror scares going on Also how would you guys pay for any property damage and medical charges  My husband told me I need to take more risks and that     I should had let his friends hurt themselves     if they wished to do that  That it is     not my place to micromanage them      That's bullshit You being the reasonable and caring human being you are were looking out for your husband and his friends That's really shitty and childish for him to say though

No Not at all I don't understand it either Some of us are just Ferdinand the bull trying to be good people getting drug in the ring with a matador against our will I don't get it Nothing is wrong with you though I think there is something wrong with everyone else                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
I mean schizophrenia is a common link in a huuuge variety of personality types I don't see it as too much different than a normal couple If you're both into each other and have the capacity to communicate and express yourselves well then I don't see why it shouldn't work I've dated people with other various mental health challenges though none with sz One was bipolar another depression and a third PTSD bpd It was just a matter of understanding each other's needs and being able to empathize with that They were all better at it than I was though which is why I'm single Ha                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Sounds like a good plan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
I don't get people who laugh at others for not knowing something We're all human nobody can possibly know everything Don't ever think that you should be good at something only because people expect you to be good at it Maybe you haven't found the right social circle for yourself Some people are narrow minded and judgmental but that's not the case for everyone                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Yeah I've been there For me it didn't turn out that badly that particular person was drunk and it barely registered I remembered when I behaved like him I was more worried about what I said that pissed someone off while I was drunk You shouldn't feel like shit you stuck up for yourself and did great Congratulations and I won't drink with you                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
How long do you think it took you I've been dealing with it on and off for two years now and I'm starting to feel like it'll never pass and I'll never be able to live a normal functioning life glad to know I'm not alone At  years old I'm sure it would be extremely scary Thanks for the support                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
Really depends where you are living I live in Germany and English is my second language maybe that's why I love you doesn't mean too much to me like in German Ich liebe dich I can see why you are sad I wish somebody would liebe me But I like you if that's fine                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
I talk to myself as if I was talking to someone else i e I start a conversation with myself to see what's wrong in a kind manner and respond as I would respond to a friend loved one

you weren't drunk enough                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
I was just wondering what was considered legitimate selfharm Kind of like r hazard0usstupidity mentioned no one has ever mentioned the nails thing I used to purposely give myself ingrown nails and it was a mess That was probably more dangerous than some of my milder forms of self harm Hm                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Feel free to ignore this because I don't got no advice Because usually in this case I'm the clingy one who has no friends However I've had a few people who were clingy to me years back and inwas brutally honest with them I highly suggest you're not though since I felt like a huge piece of shit As time passed they understood keep in mind then guy had problems too                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Is it possible that I am experiencing these symptoms without a bleed I've been starting to feel better and it seems like my stool is lightening Could this just be a bad reaction to the Tramadol and pass Obviously if I feel worse or the same tomorrow I will go to the ER but I am just curious Also the sore neck and swollen node wouldn't be related to that would it Thanks for your help

As for the zapping have you been taking your medication at the exact same time everyday It almost sounds as if you're having withdrawal symptoms Who's prescribing your medication I suggest seeing a psychiatrist ASAP they will be much more experienced If your anxiety is waking you up one medication I found helpful for sleeping through the night is Klonopin When pain wakes me up I prefer to take Ambien XR

Hi I'm new to this too as of  or so minutes ago and you have caught my attention I'm  and am one of the handful of people you mentioned earlier I know exactly what you mean about EVERYTHING except I'm not a graphic designer although I almost pursued that career ironically I'm in the same boat as you and your thoughts and Id like to see if we could help each other out I feel we would be able to relate to each other more than anyone else here

Well it's all perspective I was once a chronic relapser I'd make it   days and then go back out for months sometimes years This time I tried sobriety differently coming here to SD and AA and have almost  months and I don't feel worried at all about making it to a year I've also met people through AA who have relapsed after serious time One in particular that I can think of was sober for  years then relapsed and stayed drinking for  years now has almost  years sober again Honestly it doesn't matter how much time any of us have relapse is something we'll always have to be careful about That said the statistic probably makes a good point in that the longer time you have probably the easier it gets to keep going

 is pretty borderline but I wouldn't go calling it dangerously extraordinarily high You need to speak directly to your doctor You can make a phone call to the office to leave a message for the doctor On that message let them know to call you back only at YOUR number Tell them you are curious about the results of your last blood test and wanted to discuss your cholesterol specifically Ask for exact levels for total HDL and LDL and to discuss whether your levels are concerning and what you can do to help fix them Your mom being the only one to tell you and giving you some crazy dietary restrictions seems super funky to me ones that she's not even getting correct   eggs a week or less is perfectly fine for cholesterol and you can always use just the whites You want to stay away from trans fats specifically but you need healthy fats like those in olive oil beans and seeds fatty fish like salmon fruits like avocado etc Milk is also good stuff you can stick to it in moderation and use skim milks You're making good choices in severely limiting fast food and discontinuing heavy dairy consumption but remember there's more to it than that You sure as hell don't need to go vegan At the very most a pescatarian vegetarian but still eating fish would be fine You might ask your doctor about supplementing with Niacin and you want to incorporate plenty of niacin rich foods into your diet like turkey chicken mushrooms tuna and peas Lastly it'd do you good to create a myfitnesspal com account and track your intake daily You can track cholesterol and trans fats and set a proper calorie goal You also want to keep track of your fat sodium and fiber Getting your weight down to about  would help you out a lot Getting out for regular walks about  minutes every single day would be highly beneficial too

I tried to stop caffeine consumption Though there are many benefits written about caffeine it is somehow a trigger for me and urges get stronger when I drink it

Everyone react different to NSAIDs I would suggest you stop it and take it only when needed Otherwise there's a chance that you might develop problems due to the constant use of it

Boy it sure did for me It took me about  weeks to balance out although I have to admit I really wasn't good at dealing with anxiety Turns out its one of those skills I didn't have that I covered by drinking                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
I used to sometimes do but less intense then i figured the world doesn't revolve around me and its an ego thing When it happens i just observe the thought and let it go i sometimes laugh about it in my head                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
The only hallucinations that I have been able to interact with are not people or voices The most vivid one I've had of a person was a shadow person I saw him a number of times that night hanging around a tree the last time I saw him he charged right at me actually went straight through the door of the van I was in and disappeared into thin air right before he crashed into me Gave me a freakin heart attack

porn is a damn bottomless pit and you know well that the devil wants you in there so don't go in there There is no satisfaction with the porn and there never will be This pit is like something that if you even turn your eyes to the right or to the left it can suck you in So you need to look straight ahead and if your eye wanders to the right or to the left you need to remember that it is just an eye and you don't have to chase after things that catch your eye's attention

Hey congrats The same thing happened to me but I was  at the time Guess what  years later I'm married to the girl                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
I tried very hard to see it that way too I've just been hammered by misfortune this year and every time I get my hopes up two more things go wrong It's a combination of lousy circumstances and having a mood disorder Ugh Thank you for being so compassionate though I appreciate it

You can do it But only if you actually are done and want to quit You have to concede to the fact that you will never ever smoke another cigarette for the rest of your life If that's truly what you want you will succeed

Don't do it out of peer pressure If you do not want to drink then don't But if you honestly want to try it just have a beer

I really have been considering buying a house but am having trouble deciding on what kind Do I buy a small house assuming I will be FA forever Or a larger one in the  chance I have a family in the future Is it worth buying one as a single person My rent is insane about  so I feel I would be far better off putting the money towards a property I own                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
I want to go visit a friend in Scotland so I'm going to push myself to leave my comfort zone to try to find work so I can save up I don't know how it'll be working and I'm nervous but I'm going to try until I can't try any more                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
It would be more productive and positive to look at it as just a bump in the road dont look at it too long it doesnt serve you If you need support like all of us well we are here for you but also know that we all know the game and how you reacted isnt making any of this situation better Please dont beat yourself up just go on and forget about it Dont blame yourself Dont blame others Continue and go with the flow                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Yeah dude it got to the point where even when I was smoking alone at my house once I'd get high all I could think about were things that would terrify me That's what drew the line for me cause I realized that if I'm feeling so uncomfortable just smoking by myself and not getting any enjoyment whatsoever out of it anymore there's no point to me smoking It's a shame cause smoking used to be one of my favorite things to do but I guess it's nice that I've stopped since I'm not spending money on it anymore I don't have to be scared of getting pulled over with it in the car anymore and without it distracting me I've been trying to work on myself the past few months I've been going pretty hard in the gym the past few months and I'm making great progress which is helping my anxiety cause of self esteem from getting in shape and also cause of the endorphins and all that which gets released from hard exercising on a regular basis

I would take pictures or video of the hose get concrete evidence not proof evidence that they were stealing your water Then confront them and demand they pay you back for the overage of the water bill If they decline you sue the shit out of them in small claims court Talk with your water company and find out how much your bill would normally be without the overages and total it up and Sue for that amount If you have concrete evidence you should have a pretty strong case

 I do acknowledge the fact that different people need different amounts of sleep but there's a minimum  hrs gives a barely functioning mind not useful for academic purposes and a maximum  hrs is ideal amount of sleep highly useful for academic purposes threshold for the hours of sleep a person must get Most people who get more or less sleep than this this range do suffer from different problems poor long term memory poor problem solving ability for sleep less than  hrs and obesity laziness heart diseases for sleep more than 8hrs in the long run and partial mental impairment in the short run I don't even need to give u a proof u can test this out urself just sleep   hrs and then do a task involving high order problem solving and see ur performance drop down Personaly us adhder's should get a good  hrs sleep if we want to do a mentally engaging task since our TRUE mental potential is hampered already Physical tasks may be exempted from this rule depending on the task  I wouldn't want to decline the quality of my life over its quantity now would I                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
I read your other post about how you want to kill yourself and I think that you might be helped by talking with an online therapist right now People who will talk to you immediately and you can work through your feelings Sibly is an app that is only available for iPads and iPhones but it worked really well for me It is free for the first week or month I can't remember but the point is that you can talk to someone immediately There's also Lifeline Crisis Chat and Blah Therapy You deserve to be listened to and I agree with you about taking care of yourself first So many people will try to take advantage of you in life and you are better off when you can figure out quickly who is trying to help you and who wants to harm you Stay away from the bullshit as much as you can I know it's hard but these feelings and thoughts are by definition temporary and you will feel better you just have to be patient with yourself                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Keep talking You're just making yourself look more and more like a fool Or maybe you're just a troll I'm leaning towards the second one Edit oh I see you're a poster on r incels Well that clears things up

I don't watch porn anymore but I always get porn videos played again on my mind I unconsciously remember those what I did was not to dwell on it I focus on what I do today what I do now                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
MY fear is once I 'accept' being FA and resign myself to it the rest of me will go At that point what's the point in staying in shape Or getting a shitload of money and having a good career What's the point of life in general to retire old and die old and alone I feel like at least not giving up gives me some kind of a purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
I read the whole thing I can empathize with some of it especially classroom anxiety I used to drop a class if I thought I would fail or do poorly but I changed my policy to powering through everything I lost a lot of percentage points for attendance and participation lack there of I would definitely watch a documentary about your life                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
If they want to fuck themselves up let them If they don't whilst doing so then it will happen eventually and so they will learn another life lesson On the other hand grade  fireworks in Prague heh Can't say I wouldn't be up there with them too Nothing to feel shitty about none the less people being people Be glad you're there for them lol                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Take on each issue individually and try start with achievable goals Progressively improve on them Dont be distracted by social media and others more privileged If you wanr to use it fot your benefit find idols that inspire you not all of them had it easy You have a hunger to succeed that they dont use it to your benefit Your english is good keep working on that too Lastly you are young Good luck                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Well another side effect of Tramadol overdose is stool lightening Most of the time when your stool is black and tarry it is because of old dried blood It could be possible that the bleeding has stopped and the negative effects are going away but you can never be too sure Also there is no correlation between swollen lymph nodes and Tramadol use but if the effects worsen by tomorrow you should seek medical attention Hope you get better mate definitely let me know what happens Good luck

Great post I have recently re discovered creative writing I used to love writing short stories poetry even attempted a novel when I was about  I'm sure it was terrible I'm fairly artistic in several ways I like to do photography and draw a little too Last month I randomly came up with a story idea too late for NaNoWriMo though and I've been slowly writing on it ever since I'm up to   words and it's just awesome to get lost in the characters I'll be working on it tonight as I wait for the new year

Man that sucks I've had some wonderful fights I've totally forgotten about I've actually had my wife waiting for me to apologize for something and I really had no recollection of what Not doing that now is certainly a big advantage to sobriety                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Wanted to check in and express my gratitude to the mod i come here to learn more about my condition and to give and receive support around problems that come up Having an ESA is awesome I have one But i would only post about her if it was relevant to someone's problem and might help them i think the key word is help if seeing cute animal pics helps someone that's awesome and they can see limitless amounts of them on r aww and related subreddits if you're the one posting a GPOESA Gratuitous Picture Of Your Emotional Support Animal think about whether the enjoyment you get out of that is worth pushing off the front page someones desperate need for support and advice

My thoughts are with you Even if you couldn't bring yourself to doing it remember that you tried you considered it you reached out to someone for help That is more than a lot of people do and it is brave Remember one step at a time I know we want to fix everything all at once even though we don't know how Don't push yourself beyond your limits but do try to focus on at least one goal to achieve Even if it's as simple as getting up and making your bed in the morning or walking around the block if you can acheive these goals perhaps you can achieve something harder in time I hope that even if things didn't go the way you hoped that perhaps you feel lighter knowing even if it hurts When we hit rock bottom there is only one direction to go You are kind and brave I believe in you

I understand where she is coming from in regards to sort of ending your relationship I have done this many times myself I felt that my eating disorder was stronger than my relationship s and I wanted to put all my energy into my disorder rather than the relationship if that makes sense lol The eating disorder even makes you think that you don't deserve a relationship or deserve to be happy I also felt strongly that I was a burden to every one around me Your GF might feel this same way Like the other poster said you can't help someone who doesn't want to be helped You can be there for her to support her but you can't do the work for her You can text her everyday and ask her how she's doing just knowing that one person out there cares about her will help Remind her that she is beautiful and worth it As for treatment she needs to see a therapist at least once a week I don't know what her financial situation is but this is really crucial to getting better She won't be able to do it on her own There a lot of resources online if you live in the Canada www nedic com has a lot of good resources And https www nationaleatingdisorders org if you live in the states

Fuck was only on 1mg but I became extremely agitated and couldn't handle it had to constantly be watched so I wouldn't hurt myself same reaction to many other medications as well no matter the dose I still went through with it for a few months but I only had delusions at the time It didn't seem to help Now I hate medications with a burning passion I'll still take them if I have to though

 you don't HAVE to drink in order to have a social life You can still go to bars and hang out but no one's forcing you to drink and if they are they're just douchebags and you probably shouldn't befriend them anyway

While don't think bad is really a good word for it It simply that by listening to that song it makes you think about something different or even less productive than if you just sat in silence you know what i mean But at the same time those   minutes you listened to your favorite song in the shower or car might make you feel good and make you choose good actions all day In my opinion everything happens how it's supposed to So never regret what has happened to you I think it's up to us to take the things we see and learn the lesson from them Edit TLDR nothing has meaning and its up to us to find make it

 free to scroll back to my early posts I was all over the place And it's very normal I think many of us have covered anxiety with alcohol For me I did it for years Once we aren't drinking anymore it hits full force Thankfully it does get better I'm not saying I never have anxiety I do And when it hits it's still the full force I can't stop thinking about it kind of anxiety I've found it doesn't last as long and I am able to quiet my mind much easier

I'd know how to block any ability to browse the web on your iphone Im not just interested in that for not looking at porn but also for mindless websurfing Also can I block myself from installing a certain app In my experience any restriction I've set on my iphone this far is easily cancelled by a single click so its not really a block at all

You there's abortion there's adoption and there is also total and logical acceptance You made a mistake we all do Accept it forgive yourself which you are both currently doing and just work hard Yes it'll be tough to manage a kid school growing up and working but eh That's life deal with it Be happy you may have a son daughter Nothing is impossible is life provided you work hard and you realise the end goals End goals being having a life and taking care of one Granted you may not have all the experience but a person will never ever have all the experience they need You have parents to help girlfriend to help her parents to help too Don't think it's a burden to put responsibility to them it's not We are humans we all take and give We all can help with each others issues Just don't be lazy don't give up and don't forget                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Great just don't know what the problem is I'm not bad looking decent height weight ok job I do have confidence and social skill issues but that does not really come off when I first meet people so it's not like they can see through me that I'm depressed Each rejection is like a hammer hitting a nail making me go further down and down each time until eventually you just want to give up there is no satisfaction in life anymore

After thinking of this in black and white There is a huge middle ground between locked in the psych ward with forced medication and deal with it myself  You can talk to therapists about your struggles and get help without being immediately sent to the ward as long as you aren't trying to kill yourself someone else etc etc It's your decision whether or not you take meds It sounds from your posting history that you're out to do a bunch of drugs and not try to prevent psychosis I don't really feel much sympathy towards that so I'm not going to help you learn how to hide it from your doc It's your choice and I respect that and I hope I don't see you posting in crisis in the future from those decisions

Cancelled vietnam the military used to give pilots amphetamines to induce a hyper focus and to keep them up and alert I'd assume an ADHD fighter pilot is a plus because they are stimulated and that hyper focus comes naturally Interesting stuff

I get cardiac symptoms when supply doesn't meet demand Supply being blood and demand being oxygen requirements of the heart This can occur for a variety of reasons When cocaine is the cause the coronary vessels which supply the heart oxygen constrict which can cause a spectrum of symptoms ranging from chest pain to a heart attack Assuming the cocaine didn't do anything structurally to your heart the damage is just transient and as long as you don't use anymore you should be fine A good indication of this would be that you are able to do exertional activity without any symptoms

That know Saying it feels like beating a dead horse but it's TRUE I'm a student physical therapist interested in working in a collaborative practice focused around the treatment of mental illness I know several centers that employ a physical therapist to work with patients suffering from mental not physical ailments because it's so so important I have my own fair share of personal experience with mental illness and I accept that for me personally I have to do some form of exercise every day some days vigorous some days active recovery I have to eat well most of the time This is on top of medication and vitamins probiotics fish oil and rhodiola It takes upkeep But it beats being so depressed I let my life pass me by while I rot in despair and emptiness A big tragedy and part of my life's work is that a lot of people have a very narrow concept of what they think exercise is They think of the gym and they hate the gym I hate the gym too But I can run a marathon and move over 100lbs by myself partly because physical therapy is a manual labor job I love being outside in nature and so that is where I exercise in my spare time Other people like being social and might enjoy something like swing dancing or rec league basketball Others yet might be curious about yoga or pilates Some don't have any interest in exercise whatsoever but can commit to walking  minutes a day if they think of it as part of their treatment Movement is medicine Some people like it some people think of it as a necessary evil but the key point is that it is in fact necessary for good mental and physical health I am still learning how to best convey this to my patients but if they only listen to one thing I say that's the most important take home message

I'm Your body reacts to the stimulation around it and also the semen you hold onto gets re cycled by the body to secrete pheromones repair and build muscle among other things That's just broscience but there's really nothing else your semen has to do if you aren't shooting it out so it makes sense The female people attraction in general is because of the hormones you are blasting as a result of not getting any kind of sexual activity or stimulation so your body has no choice but to put out more hormones in order to get what it wants I also think we get a sharper sense of smell as streaks go on because I get a supernatural ability to detect when a woman is turned on by me and that turns me on to say the least Sometimes it's obvious through body language sometimes not so that's why I think it's through smell Pheromone exchanges with them I guess Happens with guys too but it's more of a happy chill feeling than a sexual tension one

Progress have been really lucky to be off work this week while I go through the first few days I told my doctor but he didn't prescribe anything I am sleeping a lot exercising going to one meeting a day drinking fizzy stuff and tea eating chips and chocolate basically babying myself for a week I am taking acetaminophen paracetamol for headaches but nothing else Good luck you can do this Not drinking with you today                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Pffff are in the place to find friends that are like digital pen pals Whether by internet or by seeing them in person friends are friends I have friends inside and outside this but my issue is that I have to walk my own path alone whereas my friends cannot walk my path that I have chosen for myself You can make friends and you will it takes time Having a routine can help with that Like if you go to a certain store on a regular basis you could spark up some small talk and perhaps a conversation on a future day with a cashier or someone It's good practice There are online communities that if you join you can meet people Everything from craigslist to even youtube can be used to meet people who you could possibly meet eventually I have met people on youtube and they called me on the telephone multiple times You ought to just try and keep trying without giving up because winners don't quit and you know it

My year I was decluttering my room  foot by  foot room completely full of junk that I've had my entire life When I say completely full I mean you could barely even enter the room Like what you'd see on tv level bad Anyways I was all alone last year and didn't have a bed or a couch to sleep on so I got drunk alone just sitting on my floor in a corner until I fell asleep What proceeded that New Years was by far the worst year of my life Dog dying being abandoned by the very few friends that I thought I had Dad having a massive heart attack are some highlights There was quite literally zero positive days for me in  I feel so much worse today than exactly  year ago The only difference I felt like a year has made is that I have a bed to sleep on tonight I don't really know why I'm sharing this I guess your post just reminded me of myself                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Oh say semen retention or built up sexual energy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
One i've had with neurotypicals is generally down to their ignorance and misunderstanding I'd just learn the disorder down to the core and from there just being as understanding supportive and helpful to him as you can be That's all someone with aspergers can really ask from others

So really giving it my all to not fap on the year  But I am prepared to fail and do whatever to get back on track  I had less caps then I did since I was probably  better off beating off What So trying to make changes is worse then just not trying at all That's a dumb statement

Thank you sure kept that conveniently vague A serious illness I suppose if you leave it that open ended anything you say will be TRUE Not sure the point of saying it though Infection genetics and lifestyle are the most influential causes of disease Pretty much every doctor I know thinks anyone who gets sick either has an infection or it just happened to them AKA genetics For people in this profession to completely omit the entire lifestyle factor like they tend to do is insanity                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
If it Made it through three pubs two bands a very disorganised countdown and a semi cautious walk home Huge huge relief right now Happy new year guys                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
I is very similar to what I've been going through Maybe check out my posting history and let me know if there's anything you want to talk about                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Well owned houses twice The first one didn't end up financially worth it due to a market crash I had to move for work and I was underwater so I made it a rental but as it was a small house in a family oriented town keeping it rented at a useful price was difficult so as soon as I could sell it for more than I owed I did at about  below what I originally paid My current house is small 2br but in an area known for vacation rentals so worst case if I have to move to a city for work or find a partner and need to move somewhere larger I'm pretty sure I can keep it rented and paying for itself even if I can't sell So the variables are too numerous to count but I find it worth it If it looks like the real estate and job market where you are will let you stay for at least  years then it's probably worth it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
So in Let's do this Best streak so far  days I will look into new ways to combat my urges doing push ups whenever I feel them taking a cold shower meditation whatever This is something I've neglected doing in the past

Yeah this is exactly my sister situation She has been drinking heavily for the last  years broke up with her long term fiancee was recently fired out of a job only after a few months because of drinking She was seeing a psychologist but quit that and although she admitted once that she drinks more than normal I feel she is in overall denial I also live far and see her   a year but if she continues this way she may not make it in the next   years she is only

Yup thank you it means a lot to me I read some post that really changed my perspective and shaped my battle for the rest of my life so i'm glad my own post has ignited a light in someone else or at least helped

 sticking it at home as well I fly out of town tomorrow afternoon and am looking forward to waking up with a clear head and when it's at its worst not waking up to the fear and anxiety of what may have happened the night before I have lots of plans and stuff I want to accomplish this coming year and starting it out on the right foot sounds good to me Happy New Year to you                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Take This is how social norms are enforced If you want to opt out just stand your ground If you want to do a shut up ring to keep them quiet buy a mossanite ring Utterly brilliant but less than a thousand all said All they want is to see something sparkly                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
I don't think so for multiple reasons First of all starting the timer is a conscious decision you make That puts you back in control at least in your mind Second the time it takes for you to start the timer is a period where you aren't panicking because you know exactly what to do I imagine that it jolts you out of fight or flight mode but it's just a guess Third by touching something that you don't need to touch and being aware of that sensation will ground you in your body Same principle as mindfulness basically This is enforced by the fact that you have to wait for a specific visual change to happen afterwards Fourth because you have to see the clock ticking before you can concentrate on anything else time will become very concrete All in all I don't think that it's possible to learn that the button doesn't do anything because it does it just doesn't do anything that's logically helpful to whatever problem you're having Maybe the opposite will actually happen maybe your brain will get conditioned to go into calm calculating mode when you press that button

Shame for responding After doing some recent research I realized that I had been misunderstanding him He would then react negatively and I would react to his reaction These conflicts made much more sense after his diagnosis but I've been doing all the wrong things                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
Yeah some interviewing classes I took I learned that almost all questions asked in these kinds of interviews can be answered with just a handful of examples Try to think of examples of different things you've handled that might apply to situations that the job will entail For example I work in retail so I try to have a situation for customer service one for leadership one for problem solving etc You can rehearse those answers before the interview to make yourself more comfortable

From I've always been fat Which is weird because I'm the only fat person in my family mom dad and brother are all incredibly thin I somehow got fucked over But getting on meds for my severe depressive episodes ballooned me up to  pounds Sounds crazy but it happened mileage varies with meds but Prozac really fucked me up Went off of those and in July I got on something which was not notorious for weight gain big thanks to my doc for helping out with that specific issue When I got my blood tests back I saw that my triglycerides were high and I was a couple of points away from pre diabetes so I've been cutting down on sugar and cutting down portions I have been dropping weight since July I'll probably be getting a blood test again soon as I keep exhibiting even more symptoms of PCOS but hopefully my numbers have improved I wish that the weight loss was quicker but without the loose skin

For think that it comes down to the basis of our societies Everyone has the right to live with equal rights to express themselves freely and to get help when they need it We all deserve it I'm going to be  honest suicide is tricky because those who suffer a lot don't feel like they could live a better life and they feel like it's better to end it It's not a reasonable decision They would continue on living if they weren't as much emotionally overwhelmed With that being said What's happening in your life to make you think of suicide

Go feel like I know where you're coming from When I was younger I learned to associate alcohol and drugs with for lack of a better word assholes My parents always set a good example but seeing the behavior of my peers who drank and did other things left a bad taste in my mouth to the extent that I decided I'd never drink until the legal age  and never do drugs Fast forward a few years to college when I'd met new people had new experiences and I did decide to have a few beers despite being just  For me it felt right mostly because the people I was with then were better people I didn't see this as a betrayal of my younger self just a change in circumstance It sounds like your situation may be similar Anyway your mileage may vary but I would say to give it a try and have fun It's your life and you are allowed to change your mind at the end of the day you are only really accountable to yourself

Ohay adrenaline is a stimulant so it normalizes us I don't think it has anything to do with hyperfocus                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
 yourself as a helper and especially inviting PMs as a first resort are both against the posted rules here                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
This I'm out in Springdale It took me about a month to see a psych back in  because I was trying to kill my self constantly but they still suck It's awful and I really don't believe they try their best here                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Congrats being honest is a good trait I have and will get into arguments over how mean or insensitive I am but I stand by my principle that at a moment where my opinion is requested I will give my real opinion Unless it's a life or death situation getting into intricate lies is not going to get anywhere When asked if you like the food and you don't like it say you don't like it Honesty is a curse at times but stand by it and you'll build a character that people can trust in the long run Also try to turn this in your favor One thing that I always see mentioned on reddit and that I'll never understand is people saying I'm fine when asked how they are even when they aren't Just say you aren't fine Open up and communicate what you have on your mind Of course maybe you already do it in that case continue to do so Being honest and opening up about your real feelings will help you because the people who reject you who are in my opinion very weak minded and not worth the trouble will go away and the rest will trust you much more because you show weakness and confidence Maybe you can be an inspiration to other people who are afraid to voice their opinions too

Yes here l I don't understand why OP thinks its better to just beat off rather then trying to have a goal of quitting for good even if its unrealistic it is possible I'd love to live my life totally fap free and the fact I have the ability and can make the right choices to do that

Welcome I am very much like this guy apart from I know when to fuck off and stop acting creepy The dude clearly feels lonely I know this because I am too I am very confident when it comes to talking to people over Steam and online but I always over think in real life situations and end up just sitting there beating myself up about it Maybe he has more problems than you think He wrote those paragraphs to apologize to what he said about killing you I assume and I can only think he is going delusional a little When I appear a little creepy to people which I rarely do apart from when my insanity and desperation kicks in they tend to call me out on my bullshit and to back off a little in which i do Idk how you're truly going to handle this since I'm usually the OTHER person but if you known his parents or someone who is related to him it might be worth getting in contact with them and seeing what's actually going on

 was at a new years party that was pretty tough A ton of happy drunks A lot of PP  why are you moping  You should have more fun etc I just can't feel like that anymore I suffered through it and read this subreddit on my phone not to feel alone After a bunch of people had left someone asked me publicly What are you doing on your phone  PP  I said Reading  r depression  That changed the mood quite a bit but then we had a long talk about depression and therapy Everyone talked about the things in their life that they were struggling with and it felt 10x better than the stupid new years countdown Happy New Year r depression I hope things work out for you xoxo                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Someone Stop thinking that you're overly worried about the environment You have a healthy worry about our planet The thing is anxiety latches onto anything it finds blows it out of proportion inhibits you from taking your mind off of it at all and makes it seem like it's the end of the world The way it takes over your mind can be horrifying and make you want to be asleep Seek professional help when it gets to that level Medication and therapy can be a lifesaver Edit you're not seeing what other people aren't You're super overreacting because of anxiety taking over your mind I know it feels like it's a genuine worry but it's not you it's you on anxiety

 is so heavy What a terrible situation the both of you have been put in My personal opinion is that it's not such a bad thing to do internet background checks However what they chose to do with the information that they found was what I find very wrong This is a tough situation to be in I kind of wonder if her parents are maybe feeling anxiety of their daughter being married and coming up with any odd reason they can other than just that to justify being against your marriage I feel like it's not going to feel right to anyone if you hold this negativity before the wedding I would do what you can to find peace with the situation and move on with or without their blessing

This can you be more specific You have to understand that you ARE FREE to do whatever you chose of the choices that are presented to you YOU ARE FREE just don't forget it Even if your heart beats faster because you think about sex things you don't have to give in to the feeling you can endure it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Basically i thought maybe withdrawal too as I've just tapered off the Entocort But I've had these exact same symptoms before I was on any medication at all back in August I feel like there is definitely a physical issue maybe exacerbated by my anxiety levels but all of my doctors seem very dismissive I feel very very ill but look fine so it's presumed it's all in my head

Doing just completely honest which is a good thing and a bad for those who are emotional I've come to learn some situations it's just good laugh at a shit joke and it's good to be honest when critizism is required Differentiate situations with this logic then get yourself into the habit of thinking about how to react in said situation If you're a think before you speak type this shouldn't take to long to impliment

Good also think that sex with someone mutually attracted to you could be mind blowing Also I've heard that even when  people mutually attracted to each other have sex for the first time it can still be awkward and not great So you've got to get a girlfriend and do it a few times to get comfortable with each other before it can become mindblowing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
What actually depends on how  long and  interesting the post feels to me                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Even also have a theory about the Bros over Hoes thing and why some guys blow their friends out often or even start to get isolated when they find a nice girlfriend Maybe we enslave ourselves through our sexuality This also rolls with the Succubus mythology which bears striking similarity with wet dreams draining the health life force of those with weaker discipline

The depends on how comfortable with telling people you are I've had mild PTSD for many years due to childhood abuse and it became much more pronounced in my daily life after being raped last year I am super comfortable telling people my experiences and making sure they know why I do certain things I didn't do before which is totally personal to me you may feel differently I'm lucky my friends have been super supportive and understanding and I think if you feel comfortable with it it may be beneficial to tell them I've actually gotten a lot closer with certain people after telling them because they share similar situations And those who don't understand I find I don't miss them in my life Good luck I hope things work out friends are such a great support system                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
I hope I was able to help somehow And I wish you well in your endeavors                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
I prefer cold since I'm not good at regulating body temperature and am usually way too hot even in winter Cold weather really helps since I don't feel uncomfortable due to the temperature balancing out                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Happy is TRUE Headed out to get all you can eat crab legs with all the money i would have spent on booze                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
So on not drinking I find that I socialize better when I'm sober although I was very afraid of that fact At  days I would've been pretty tempted                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
Wow is different but especially since starting medication for my OCD I get WRECKED emotionally after drinking or taking Vicodin alcohol also effects opiate receptors It takes up to a week or so to get my mind back together What I recently noticed is that tequila doesn't have as bad an effect on me and I learned that tequila is the only alcohol that I've heard of anyway that is a stimulant instead of a depressant I'm going to experiment with this further and see if my theory holds out If not I guess I'm done drinking because it's just not worth it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
I please report stuff like this as it violates the posted rules and we will remove it as soon as we find it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
I might die It's not likely but it's possible I was drinking as much or more than you and though I didn't sleep for a few days and was shaking like a Polaroid picture I didn't die YMMV of course                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
There just want to piggyback on the other person because they made great points The worst part about cravings isn't that they are constantly there it's that they come in waves and some waves are small ripples and some are massive tsunamis I tell you this because in my experience you need to have a plan for when the bad cravings hit Keep a pack of gum around regular or nicotine gum I used Zonnic that you can get at   it's so unpleasant to chew that it kind of worked as negative conditioning or something else to chew on or satisfy the oral fixation I also used sunflower seeds for this Be willing to talk about it tell your wife or friends or coworkers when the cravings are bad usually they'll give you enough encouragement and support to get you through the craving And if all else fails come and post here before you smoke we'll always be here for you One thing that helped me after the first few days was telling myself that I never wanted to go through the first  days the first week the first ten days etc etc again Good luck You can do it I promise you I also can promise you this from experience It's  worth it

I started telling the truth on a different way with a positive intellectual tone For example i wouldn't say her art is bad even tho is TRUE i would say Wow  it could be considered modern art  this are despicable lines People would take as a compliment because of the way I told them without realizing i told her lines are bad and for me a modern art hater told her art is shit About the fat i would say wow  you look like  dramatic pause  do you know art  Have you ever heard of Venus  Because you resemble her People would think i am talking about those classical greek italian sculptures paintings but I'm actually talking about those african ones the fatty sculptures Normally if i'm not into making smth up i will just say I'm an honest person and my opinion will probably offend you  so pardon me already but   and then i say what I have to say That's what i started doing and it's working really well for me

Checking year hasn't sucked as much as yours but then again it isn't really a contest This year I was diagnosed with Dissociative Identity Disorder had to abandon two friend groups because I was too dumb to realize I was the asshole BOTH TIMES and had two relationships that I had no emotional connection to I'm about to go into another one and I don't want to fucking do it again but I don't know how to stop it So here I am alone again on New Years Eve listening to The National just like I was last year The only change is I have no hope for the future Even though I'm still very young I just can't see it improving especially not with what I learned about myself this year

Alright the books are The Magic of Thinking Big by David J Schwartz the secret haven't finished it and the best seller of napoleon hill can't remember the title in english again force yourself into reading them they're worth it even if some parts may seem farfetched especially hill but they're way more logical and holds great physchological principles than can change your point of view on your own action If you need a confident boost start with david j swchartz                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
No on this my friend intervened on my behalf due to the fact that I was mentally not in any place to deal I attempted to overdose last night He has admitted that unintentionally put blame on me when he was upset with his own actions We're working on what we're going to do moving forward with this I guess I wanted to give some closure that he revoked his accusation

Yeah get ready for the normies to come in asking why we just don't hit the club or something Lol yes because that's totally the logical thing for me to do here in NYC where the transportation gets fucked to fucking hell by the influx of people watching the ball drop TL DR reee                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Clearly right It's not right for them to patronize others because they feel that their beliefs are superior So why is it right for us to do the same to them These fights that break out between any two groups that disagree are destructive to both parties and there is no excuse for it to happen                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
How think I'm gonna gag                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
No relate to that but coming from somebody who's never felt attached to his family you should hold on to them in your darker hours as long as you're not being a burden on them who says you need to move out Don't feel pressured by what society says is normal you do what makes you happy

I've if I'm stating the obvious here but that's just good ol' depression for you The funny thing about depression is that it's not always sadness and hopelessness and crying sometimes it's just numbness and nothing Depression is also when you don't feel like doing anything anymore when you lay down in bed all day with a hole inside that can't seem to be filled staring at a wall trying to will yourself into doing something and then waiting for the day to end so you can rinse and repeat It's not wanting to do anything even with things that seem mundane like getting up to get something to eat or a cup of coffee it's not enjoying things you used to enjoy it's apathy and anhedonia

Happy it's just that it absolutely has to be in order Back to front top to bottom Like you're cleaning the old year out the front door the apartment is technically clean just hasn't been cleaned in order yeah the coal thing I'm honestly not even sure where it came from my neighbors seemed to know about it Like someone gifts you a coal you keep it the whole year and then burn it new years day Shoot maybe I should ditch these old traditions and just make up my own                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
So the same time it can be a real motivating factor when you have not fapped in  and when one is about to relapse they may prevent them selves when they otherwise may have not Counting on the new year is not the solution and it wont stick long term but it can help by just psychological motivation I remember in  I went  days which was my longest streak I eventually caved but just because you were not determined yesterday does not mean you cant be today Although a lot of changes are needed at the same time

 remember going through the phase of wanting to test myself around booze In the end I discovered it was just my boozy brain trying to make it that much easier to say fuck it and drink again This early on you need to make it as hard as possible to drink Put as much distance between you and the nearest bottle of alcohol as you can I hope you can work things out with your buddy Either way have a fantastic and sober new years

I think viewing crying as weakness is exactly my problem I love my parents but their most common line was we can't have a productive conversation if you're crying  Which is valid in some ways if you're blubberingly incoherent it's worthwhile to calm down then talk But I do think it created a mindset in me that crying is useless pointless and a waste of time Step  might be acknowledging that crying does serve a purpose and sometimes needs to happen in order to be productive                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
slurricane can do it You are not alone I am ashamed to admit that I always looked at the rising section of liveomg which is kinda like omegle I haven't really liked any mainstream porn because I was already addicted to live webcams and replays of amateurs It is very addictive but you can overcome it You can and you have to believe that you can first

take definitely a scary statistic but I agree that many of the people who relapse again and again in the first month myself twice this year for example skew those stats I am fully confident at  days that I have a better than  chance of making it to a year And really I'm not worried about that I just need to make it to bedtime tonight

Can u avelene0186 u Choosethebiggerlife u Lee in NY u hexqueen and u Possibilitarian2015 Seriously this all brings a tear to my eyes Did someone cut onions in my apartment I posted my response at work after an insane cascade of thoughts that occurred from my anxiety I always have this issue of an intense form of anxiety that occurs when I see my to do list and it takes MANY minutes if not hours to get out of it How I get out of it is by doing   motions of lab work I'm a graduate student Reddit and facebook and instagram were not helping my anxiety the amount of posts about suicide about seeing old friends about celebrating a year This was my toughest year losing a lot of drinking buddies and definitely getting out of depression This episode of anxiety didn't go away even after at least  motions of lab work When I came home I needed to immediately go for a  minute run to get out of my head which is a sure fire technique for me all thanks to my marathon training but in the process of changing clothes I gave a cold shoulder to my mom I went for a run and was feeling a ton better but I came home and my mom felt like I was making her feel lonely and deserting her And when I graduate and get a job I will just forget her and she started crying a lot It was heartbreaking Both of us suffering with our own anxieties our own definitions of loneliness and our own methods of relieving the intense emotion I consoled her as she has for me in the past but that realization we are both totally different people separated by   years and yet we are so similar in our behaviors and tendencies It was just surreal I gave her my reasoning for running it was either that or end our vacation together by yelling and being angry Fortunately the misunderstanding was resolved but seeing her cry that was tough After that I went to my friends home because we agreed to hang out and I was going to open up our friendship show her my musicianship teach her some folk dance from my culture watch some stand up comedians I like It was about  hours worth of hanging out but I felt so comfortable with her and my anxieties were fairly controlled I come to these messages and my feeling of loneliness is damn near melted away Thank you everyone I will post my  soon Thank you

It sounds a lot like dissociation in general Probably derealization but I've found that everything gets kinda blurry within the category of dissociation Definitely talk with your therapist or doctor They can give you some good ideas In the meantime especially if this is bothering you try researching grounding techniques The physical ones especially have helped me a lot like putting on hand lotion feeling how my feet feel on the floor scents warm showers etc

Sounds I agree One more thing I forget to mention is time You never know when you are gonna leave this world So we shouldn't waste our time                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Thanks want you to know something This is normal It doesn't make it any easier but you aren't alone in feeling this Millions of  year olds are feeling the same right now and many are going to be able to move past it I hope you can I want to warn you not to fall into self destructive behavior and to try to get help Avoid drugs and alcohol especially because you could form very VERY psychologically harmful addictions And most importantly hold on to your friends I wish I did even if you don't really like them Someone there who doesn't give a shit is still someone there Remember you're  you have two ways in life Either you conquer it rather you minimize it eventually or you just get used to it There is always suicide but don't do that There's really no point You'll get out into the world soon enough and then you can do whatever the fuck you want Maybe not whatever but you're far more free Just hang in there dude                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thank difficult to get on disability payment in Australia and took me over a year the fact I successfully got on it without faking or exaggerating anything must mean something I can't leave the house alone without having panic attacks sometimes vomiting and often feeling like I'm going to faint I need someone to accompany me otherwise I don't know what kind of trouble I could get into In situations where I have severe panic attacks I become unresponsive and mute I can't respond to authority such as police etc Don't even get me started on getting behind the wheel as that feels impossible at least in the near future Gotta learn to walk before you can run and run before you can drive right I've tried volunteering can do a few hours a week as long as I'm taken to and from by family The places I volunteer tend to be quiet and slow paced environments low risk and low responsibility but even if I go for a few months I can still feel anxious about going from time to time I vomited before my third date and had to quickly freshen my breath and get something to eat at a fast food place even though I usually eat healthy In fact I often vomit or nearly vomit before dates or asking an acquaintance out I have to try and relax myself before almost any situation related to study work dates etc The psychologist had said I quote Everyone experiences nerves  anxiety  and such  but for you it tends to be 10x worse  Anyway guess it's time to go job hunting I'm sure I'm equally capable as everyone else Everyone vomits on their way to the bus stop everyone freaks out shakes and can't physically speak whenever their boss gets angry at them This stuff is normal right

The thing is that I know I'm supoosed to eat meat but I can't mentally get around the texture And for fruit it's the taste and how cold it is I know these are just more stupid excuses to keep being picky I know the answer seems so simple but I feel so dumb sometimes I would eat apples their flavor is not bad but if they have any dark or soft spots I freak out I don't know if this has to do with my ocd but if I see anything like that I have to throw it away I am so frustrated with myself Edit also thank you so much for answering

Your good to hear from someone who has perspective from the other side of this I will say that I understood he was lonely and I really wish I could have been a companion for him to talk to But on the other hand I hear about all of these stories of cyberstalking turning into physical stalking And since I know him in real life I think he lives with his mom and I do want to help but I don't know if I should directly put myself in this situation again Maybe an anonymous letter

Thank virgin male here  I am about as nerdy as you can possibly get except for the do well in school part I only did okay in school But all the other stereotypes I fit perfectly Shy introverted scrawny wear glasses don't go outside except for work food work as a programmer don't care for sports play video games watch anime like sci fi including star wars and star trek etc  I'm not  yet but I'm close enough over  I think people like Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg have made being a nerd more acceptable in certain parts of the US but only if you are actually successful or attractive obviously In terms of dating I've noticed that nerdy white guys are fairly successful in my area but geeky Asian guys still have it very very tough

My think it's more that online dating and the internet have made it so you don't have to be confined to a small pool of people Why settle for John from class when you can pick from one of the  matches on Tinder                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
This as simple as resource management at the most basic level From the minute you are born until the minute you die you are benefiting from society in some way Do you use the roads Did you attend school Have you ever used public health care in any capacity If so taxpayers have contributed to your existence in some capacity Therefore there's a vested interest in ensuring that you live long enough to contribute back to the pool of resources There's also empathy human decency etc but at a strictly cost benefit ratio if people start killing themselves without contributing to society on a regular basis then everyone loses Happiness is so subjective and spontaneous I would always listen to someone's rationale for suicide before talking them down As shitty and horrible as it sounds some people IMO would be better off pulling the trigger see patient with a terminal painful illness so I would never try to tell them to keep fighting etc etc In your case and I'm basing this solely on your language and perceived tone so I could be wrong you are too young to off yourself Choices of words like I don't deserve to be here and I'm not happy living to me suggest some sort of internalized burden My advice and encouragement to you is to find a form of repentance that will allow you to forgive whatever it is you feel has removed your right to be here For me personally I find philanthropy to be truly humbling Give it a whirl sometime see if it changes your philosophy                                                                                                                                                                                                 
 pretty sure all effects depend on dosage which is usually increased gradually when it comes to anti depressants At least SSRI Sadly those meds can make anxiety worse before they kick in for real for some people it takes some experimenting with different meds of the same kind to find one that works properly Yeah right now I use quick fix and that's enough at least for now I'd rather avoid anything more powerful I keep my dosage as low as possible even now and especially anti depressants because they made me rather numb emotionally I'd use them if I had to though but I'd seek therapy ASAP too

Weird think the closest thing my belief system aligns to is deism I view us the universe as a massive abandoned experiment nothing more We are in charge of our own fate In practice I only believe in what has been proven and I find it easier to just identify myself as an atheist or agnostic

me all about what you smoke It always made me really anxious but after moving to Seattle and knowing what exactly I'm smoking and figuring out what i need is a wonderful tool that helps me get the best sleep I've had in a very long time Coming from someone who never could sleep at all because of anxiety

 Waiting does nothing ffs It won't magically get better by itself Just being out there and being present also doesn't do anything I could do this again for years without any results It's very very hard work for me nothing else  Me too Telling me to love myself is like telling an arab guy what's the best snow to ski on  No but my problems are the reasons I'm not in a relationship and I'm certain that a relationship now and then could be related to happiness and a feeling of selfworth Just an idea of me  And see how few things I am able to do Observing others who are healthy and having fun Yeah that worked well for years Not sure what I can tell you Have you tried online dating It might be easier

I'm completely your choice You don't have to do it out of peer pressure but you can if you think it would be enjoyable for you Personally I think you're putting too much thought into it It doesn't matter whether it looks cool or not Most people like getting drunk because it's fun as long as you drink responsibly You don't even need to get drunk either A lot of people just have a little bit at a time to ease their nerves and help them relax Alcohol isn't as big a deal once you start drinking it

Yep  thoughts  My HOCD became completely manageable once I stopped caring if I was gay Once I wasn't frightened by the idea it went away So work on that There are many ways to go through life and I know so many wonderful gay people in my life who live very well  I would try to figure out through your therapy and treatment why you are acting on your thoughts Not trying to make your HOCD worse but I personally find it interesting that you engage in your thoughts Might be completely normal for OCD but I think it's worth asking a professional about If it turned out you are actually attracted to men and you could learn to accept and be ok with that it could change your life for the better

That I highly recommend the reading I can completely relate to the problems you share and even though you are a woman the book is basically about relationships regardless of gender

Lee best thing I can say is take it one day at a time It is the best advice I have ever got As it's so easy for me to worry about failing before even starting

This that sounds so hard what I've realised is that there is no real trick you just have to sit through the time and tolerate your feelings there's no magic trick to it I'm so sorry for what you're going through x                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
At now I understand what you mean Actually addictions are a symptom Most alcoholics are not alcoholics because of the taste of alcohol Most of them are of reasons like financial and personal difficulties marriage problems anxiety depression etc These are the reasons why people try to find an escape in something e g alcohol drugs extreme behavior etc Masturbation and especially porn are also just a symptom of something going not right in life something missing In a loving relationship with a partner porn shouldnt have any place and value and even masturbation wouldnt be considered as something exciting The reasons we fap and watch porn are the problem pmo just a symptom I realise this often analyzing my own behavior When I am having fun with friends a meaningful conversation helping others and doing generally purposeful and fun things in life I dont have the urge to fap and watch porn It is the moments in life where I dont experience these fun and purposeful things in life Then I try to escape in something to make me feel good at least for a few seconds minutes But we know that this will lead to a downward spiral if you lose control which is unbelievably easy

Immunity therapy is usually your best bet But you have to be able to make it clear that while you could kill yourself you're not going to Which also means you have to have an obligation to yourself not to kill yourself until then I'm in the same boat and it's  weeks until my first appointment Maybe we can use each other for support Work together to get through the next two month so we both can make it to getting some help

This I would do I'd be mad and just not talk to them for a while till they realize you gone if they don't then forget em' and get new friends you don't gotta wait and see while still being there                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Eh do realise and we try to make sure our enforcement reflects that knowledge We're not perfect and we do the best we can If you can suggest changes to the rules or policies that would make things better for you we're totally receptive to that                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Still on the spectrum does mean that each and every one of us is coming at life through a completely unique interpretation of the world around us For the best support I suggest starting by helping him explore his interpretations trying not to judge in the process and encourage him to learn more about himself in the process Once he can get to that place where he can appreciate his perspective on this world the next step is to find ways with which he can use those perspectives to further the relationships he has with the world he lives in I'm assuming that the recent diagnosis has come because of conflicts he's already hoping to find solutions for and even with a diagnosis there are realities that are unique to each and every one of us Exploring the good he can contribute to the world and still feel whole is the best first thing anybody can help him with in a time of upheaval Support him for who he is not for who he wants to be or who you want him to be I wish you positive directions in wherever this takes you

Then probably going to to fall apart at some point I'm hanging with the  animals I have surrounded myself with for therapeutic purposes lol It's definitely been the hardest year of my life Single for the first time in at least  years and all of two friends left one being my brother The caveat is I have lost  lbs recently and I have made a great effort to cut smoking and drinking out and the hope that the coming year will be better keeps me sane I'll probably cry at some point but it happens It's got to get better next year It just has to

 don't understand what I've lost I've lost everything I've lost the gift of life I've always had it but never realised it was there just to look at someone and talk to them I can't adjust in this society anymore I feel like a monster I'm  I used to be normal  months ago I used to have a normal life I used to have friends I used to be able to talk to another human being without making them feel uncomfortable now I can't even walk in the same street as someone passing by I've stolen my future I've stolen my freedom I've stolen everything Now things aren't the same anymore my reality isn't the same anymore I've fucked up so bad I can't be in the same room as the people that were in my life before I can't even be in the same room with anyone anymore because all it took to ruin my life was me a drug and a room There are many signs that tell me I should kill myself there are little signs that tell me I shouldn't

I Although I am new to this NoFap community I have been trying different tactics for a long time Some work some don't in the long run you are just going to have to endure through all the triggers that trigger certain thoughts in your mind We cannot avoid the sleeze in the world but we can learn to endure it

Think own stopping story I was drinking  5L 2x750ml bottles of wine per night and often a little more an extra IPA or cracking open a third bottle and then saving the remainder for the next night Obfuscation of my actual drinking volume was an m o of mine I tapered if you can call it that my last night in which I only drank  high abv beers I then stopped cold turkey no meds I was in pretty good shape regular gym cardio work and my withdrawal was pretty nasty sweats sore muscles restless sleep weird diarrhea etc Never though was I thinking I wasn't going to make it The safe advice is to tell you if you are concerned to see a doctor You know yourself best Maybe they won't prescribe you anything I see this concern in your comments but maybe they will want to start with observation I had my wife at home w me that first week to make a call in case anything had gotten sideways Best wishes

 Piece of Cake by Cupcake Brown is phenomenal It is the TRUE story of a girl who grew up in foster care and touches on issues of foster care gangs sexual and physical abuse as well as following her through her addiction and recovery And it has a happy ending about where she is today I found it so helpful in understanding many issues found in social work

This Two grandparents and my family dog of twelve years died My self esteem has sunk lower and lower and I've further isolated myself from the rest of the world by maintaining as few friendships and relationships as possible because my perception of myself is so distorted that I don't find myself worthy of them

Thanks an RN I'll venture a guess on your first question about the new  mg dose my thought is that even though you technically decreased the dose by  mg you may have increased it by up to  or so Here's why When you empty a capsule into water to titrate split a dose which is fine to do with Vyvanse but NOT with most drugs in capsules you have to be careful that the drug fully dissolves I used to do this as well and I found that much of the drug would sink to the bottom of my glass and would resist dissolving into solution If you are not careful when you pour off half of the solution to drink you may be consuming a weak solution with much of the drug still at the bottom of the cup If so your new full  mg dose could be an effectively increased dose which would just take a week or two to get used to taking If you are certain that you were careful to not make that mistake then I have no idea really other than to check if you were given a different formula generic vs trade And I have no idea about your second question Sorry

I Masturbating is LITERALLY the MOST worthless waste of time  Based on my research and experiences fapping has negative implications on a persons body and health  Fapping also creates a warped view of others and yourself I could go on but these are my main reasons I've given up fapping and porn

Ive me give you some tips Be nice to everyone Treat everyone as equals especially the admins Don't say anything about someone that you haven't already said to their face If someone tries to gossip with you try to assume the best and vocalize it Example did you see Mary's outfit What is going on with her You say she looked fine to me shrug Eventually you'll get left out of it because you're not fun This is a good thing Never tell anyone a secret that you don't want everyone to know Always offer to help if you have the bandwidth If you don't have the bandwidth don't offer As a last resort listen to music on your headphones This has kept me out of trouble so far

good can apologize for screaming and such but I definitely wouldn't apologize for the actions you took Something like I'm sorry I flew off the handle a bit but I still feel like I made the right decision in removing your ability to set off fireworks  You could have seriously injured yourself or someone else  or even set the building on fire  While I understand that you wanted to celebrate  there were far safer ways to do so  I prioritize your safety above all else and don't want to see any of you hurt

I is up to you if you'd like to remain anonymous but the best way to deal with this without worrying if he'll follow you forever is to contact his Mother I just hope he doesn't come from a broken household because that may be why he is like this part of my Dad's alcoholism is part of mine Still I'd try it Better to get in contact and show your concern than blocking him off everything because that'll usually just make him feel shittier I understand how bad it really must be for you I apologise if I made it out to be if I were having a go at you because of how he feels because that is not how I was trying to come across as lol

Wonderful everyone else in this thread has given you the standard advice that we both know you already know you're clearly not an idiot and you know what you're supposed to be doing and how to do it You just don't understand why you aren't I know how frustrating it can be to get basic good advice that you already know and can't make yourself act on so please understand I want to help you break through this and if you message me I'll give you my or Skype or something and we can talk and you don't have to be alone when you leave or while you stay Okay But just for a little bit I'd like you to please work with me here on this I thought I was before and look how that turned out I am a weak pathetic fucking idiot woman I am a fucking stereotype turning statistic I am going to FUCKING GET KILLED I know this So why the fuck am I going to go back Fuck Okay for a moment let's pretend this is TRUE You believe it you're listening to it so let's take it seriously for just one moment What is it that makes you want to go back What is it that makes you so afraid of walking away of living life without him that makes it so it feels better to risk death to be with him To put it another way what would you feel if he got hit by a bus tomorrow or if he just changed Not became better for you but just stopped being the horrible psycho that he is If he became not even a good person but a morally neutral emotionally bland and boring one and just calmly ended it If he got hit by a bus Disappeared Was murdered What would you feel then What would you do then The answers to the question you're really asking whatever they are are in that place of feeling of wanting Like I said message me if you want to talk I know you know what to do and because of that I know you're strong enough and smart enough and brave enough to do it eventually once you want to do it and overcome that want decide to want to do something else The problem is that right now you don't really want to and you need to figure out why you don't The thing is it's okay that on some level you don't want to follow the good advice that we both know you know It's okay to want fucked up shit learning how to want the right things and let go of

Okay ive read your reply like  times and im still confused What are you saying i have chosen as my attitude What will be a self fulfilling prophecy Why are you saying on a BPD sub that you have the power of choice You think i choose to have BPD You think i just chose to hate and loathe myself and who i am Sounds like the same kinda thing people used to say about people choosing to be gay  or people with depression to  just cheer up   Real life doesn't work that way

Way and foremost focus on your breathing It's very easy to lapse into mouth breathing or feeling like you can't get enough air which keep the stress cycle going Try to gradually slow it down if you can find some music to time it to that helps A friend was advised told to hold her breathe for several beats inbetween each breath because it resets the body since you can't be running from danger if you're not panting Depending on the severity at work I would find an alcove and take a moment to text call my bf ask a colleague to hug me or take a bathroom break so I could drop the mask for a few minutes If I was having a really bad day I'd let colleagues know I couldn't deal with people and go out back and clean things and count down to end of shift Using muscle memory is soothing because you're not relying on memory At family events I hide in my phone just scrolling through facebook without really seeing it or if that's not allowed I just put on a listening face and go quiet If it's a party with animals I go pat play with the pets you look busy and it's soothing and distracts from using your memory I find looking at cats really helps stroking a fabric I wear a polar fleece jacket so i always have my favourite texture with me and messaging standing close to my partner Even just stroking your own arm can help if it feels right Positive statements can be hard to remember but they can help as simple as 'it's okay' or 'this will pass' right up to 'I'm allowed to make mistakes everyone forgets things no one expects you to be perfect' ect Saying out loud to others that you're out of it had a broken nights sleep or whatever can also take some of the pressure off Everyone's felt like that at some point and will be more accepting if you forget or do something silly My therapist recommends grounding and a safe space you can mentally go to so you concentrate on the five senses to bring you back to your surroundings or have ago to image that's comforting for me it's a memory of my cat in a quiet house and you keep building that image up until it feels real with all the senses I used to dissociate all the time zero memory so I started just by staring at something until I could see details in it again reminding myself where I was and working on not yelling at myself for forgetting everything I would write everything down and
Most he's with you that tells me that he wants to be with you and that he's attracted to you the way you are I obviously don't know the details of your relationship based on these few paragraphs but I can't really imagine a guy getting into a relationship with a woman whose body type he finds nasty or ugly  I'm really sorry you feel that way about yourself I've been there and it sucks and I hope you don't let it sour a good relationship assuming it is one as I said I don't know the details If you two care about each other then each of you deserves the other Good luck

Yup live in a small town and my boyfriend's dog goes in between our home and his ex wife's Right now she's spending most of her time over there as we're renovating Not too long ago we had her over for a visit we don't keep her leashed in the yard and don't have a fence never really needed to keep her contained Well she ran up to a dog being walked on a leash and right after I yelled Don't worry  she's friendly  She just snapped at the dog and kind of started snarling in the dog's face I had to drag her away and I felt really bad but I never really thought of the fact that the woman walking her dog could have pepper sprayed our otherwise very sweet friendly dog I might consider finding another route to walk if it's a consistent thing in your neighborhood Dogs are kind of like chemicals they don't always mix well together I would definitely consider this but also look after your number one buddy

In can get loans and stuff but going out of state in America can add a lot of money to tuition and housing and such can get up to about a   difference or sometimes more Im getting scholarships and in state tuition where im going but it will still cost a lot once i start to pay off the loan The field im going into wont pay out much in the beginning which will result in a lot more work on my end to pay everything off Thats why my family puts a while lot of pressure on me to get more scholarships

I friend I got deep into camster this year Costed me a lot of money and time and personal struggle I went kinda hardcore to defeat my addiction I took a pick axe and then I destroyed my computer Since then I've put things in place to ensure I won't look at cams on my phone Also started exercising and reading too Best wishes for the new year If you really want to quit then you will If you aren't all in then you'll continue to disappoint yourself until you've had enough and hopefully then you will change your ways And remember plenty of us here can help if you ask

I'm well said I think I can honestly say I do give it a good effort Ive attended events for things my friends and family were super excited about both to make them happy but also because who knows maybe ill enjoy it Ive moved my schedule around to accomodate them sat in line for hours for a release or for free tickets for something for us driven hours out of my way to pick someone up so we can go on an adventure together The problem is reciprocation When I try to get people involved in things I like do im met with half assery You cant make someone like what you like and my intent is not to change the people in my life but I dont think its too much to ask for them just to keep an open mind about things and maybe just indulge me once in a while Even after I compromised by footing the bill reschedule ad infinitum drive us there and do everything possible that would prevent them from bitching about being put out too much This is what Im tired of Being the one who puts in all the effort and tries to nurture every sensation the people in my life are inspired to have within reason just to have that trust not even be close to returned when I want to do something

It sounds like a highly specific question about an individual agency Have you tried posting this in a more local subreddit as well I have not had an MSW job that came with educational benefits but I would imagine that any assistance included in that benefit would need to be related to her job and not necessarily a totally different degree I think if she is working as a clinician it is going to be hard to argue why she needs an MBA to help in her current position In my jobs I've had money set aside for trainings and CEs CEUs to maintain my license I've never worked in a position that is for service How would that work in this position Would she have to attract clients One advantage of the salary is that even though it may seem low it's guaranteed which is potential more than you can say off the bat for the FFS

I you Although he did well in school and had achieved relative success in his area of expertise he has been struggling with functioning in other ways he's wracked with anxiety paranoid about other people and has chosen to isolate himself further and further from everyone other than immediate family and his closest friends He says that he is overstimulated and that relationships require an exhausting amount of effort We'd talked a few times about the possibility that he had Aspergers so this isn't surprising He is now reevaluating his life and he says his experiences make much more sense now

is have just gone to bed at 3am after spending  hours at a house party with  people and  of which I never met before today and I've just been wandering back and forth between the dance floor and the lounge and bar talking to people for  minute at a time or less until awkward silence kicked in and made them uncomfortable How to make  people dislike you in one night and  has only just begun I just ran out of awkwardness attempts and decided I wanted to go to sleep instead Music is still booming loud out there and the  people are still there It felt like a walk of shame I'm here as my sister's little brother and we're all adults so I feel like I've been the ultimate portrayal of self defeatedness I've not bonded with one person out of  and tomorrow I'm going back to my city and study in my dorm and continue to go down my hole of loneliness because every time I go outside I'm met with people I just can't relate to

Hey honest is a very ungrateful trait and like I said arguments are inevitable every so often You can also try to reason people on why they don't accept an honest judgment For example it's maybe a bit condescending but I sometimes say before expressing myself do you want my honest opinion or a lie   It's guaranteed to make the other person reflect on what they want to hear something comforting or the truth

I have two major goals for  First Goal Increase my current main lift maxes The three major lifts power clean squat and bench my goal is to increase them by  by the start of the season Will do it by going to off season lifting at least  of the time and to do lifting and running outside that Second Goal Obtain a   GPA Will be done by on the two weekdays I don't have lifting to organize my online and offline work as this was the primary thing holding me back As well to set aside an average of an hour every night to go over the material Hopefully this will go better as I just got prescribed for my ADD Side Goal Protect myself online Even though this sing related to anything really indeed to do that would require motivation it's something I want to do just to protect myself I'll do this by creating complex passwords and most likely using a password saving service

NC know exactly how you feel Lost my mom in February this year and also blame myself For that and other reasons sleep is literally the best part of my day I have contemplated death And like you I remember the ones who need me even if I have nothing else to contribute to their lives but my presence Most of the time words are a hollow comfort but my mom used to say You can't fall out of a ditch when I was down And I would remind her that at least we have noses  I mean really without them we'd all be walking around looking like Voldemort with no olfactory sensation I guess I mean to say that I feel the same sense of desolation The feeling that nothing will ever get better But I have to believe it will and look for the small hopes and happy moments and silly stupid humor Those moments are few and far between but I think our moms would want to see us smile I hope you can find a smile my thoughts are with you                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
I'm definitely understand what you mean in a sense We have similar experiences I find it interesting what you say about light sensitivity I get that whitish light while looking at things as well And the fact that you are also overwhelmed with existence It really does drive me nuts I'm actually more comforted by the thought of death than I am life Also it's slightly terrifying thinking of the fact that we may possibly exist forever I don't know how everyone else lives without feeling this way It's just so overwhelming Life is strange But I'm comforted knowing I'm not the only one feeling this way I really hope you and I can get back to feeling normal Or at least able to cope with these feelings Does being around other people bother you too

 It just doesn't matter Sure don't settle on using just meds do work on improving yourself in other ways as well therapy exercise meditation whatever you think could help but really don't feel guilty about using meds I went through the same thing I was wondering if maybe I was jst one of those people that use them to get an unfair advantage or maybe I was just a bit high and that's why my life was better And then it hit me that even on meds it's still ME who has to make the choice how to spend my time what to work for And anyway the whole unfair advantage thing well fuck life isn't fair at all anyway I won't make myself miserable again just because there is a slim chance I'm getting more than I should Fuck that I want to be happy and now for the first time in my life I feel I could be

yeah of the symptoms of alcoholism is an inability to predict with certainty that we won't drink more than planned This happens to you often enough that you are understandably concerned You are wise to be wondering about your relationship with alcohol What can I say Eventually I could predict with certainty that if I took one drink I would undoubtedly drink more than planned i e too much Sometimes like you I engaged in unfortunate behavior After many failed efforts to control my alcohol consumption I finally got professional help and quit drinking altogether This happily put an end to the embarrassment guilt and shame I now have a happy life without alcohol It wasn't acting out or any kind of psychological self sabotage I am an alcoholic Alcoholism is progressive It starts often with incidents like you describe but it always gets worse If there is any family history of alcohol abuse it puts us at risk for alcoholism I don't know if this applies to you I believe I inherited it from my dad's side of the family Both my father and grandfather were alcoholics Thanks for your post

Oh I know I am fifteen years old and are on nofap but then I think about all of the future years I will be saving by stopping porn now instead of when I'm twenty It's sad to me how little we ever learn about the topic We really need to educate kids that this isn't ok and that woman deserve more respect then porn gives them                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
 I hope we all stop relapsing it's totally unfair how women can dress and act sleezy and get a free ride and free money but we men have to endure seeing it all the time                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Happy no I think I understood the way that you were trying to come across I genuinely do appreciate your perspective I think his dad was abusive but committed suicide a while ago His mother has always been really nice I think I'm going to find a way to get in contact with her But probably anonymously haha Thanks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
I what you describe it seems as though he wasn't trying to hurt you He expressed clear and sincere remorse What that doesn't change is how you feel about this Some women can hold a conversation set boundaries and feel secure in moving forward For others it's a relationship ender Either is fine if you know what you want And I know it can be confusing The key here is what you believe of him and what you are comfortable with moving forward If you feel on the fence about it and you believe the relationship is strong otherwise think about couples counseling It could be brief and helpful for something like this

What all sounds really frustrating I've thought about going to the hospital too when I feel super low just to protect me from myself Do you like your therapist It sounds like you feel the advice and coping techniques he's offering aren't working for you

Don't new year Hey a supermarket isn't a bad job You can get promotions fairly easily I used to work at one for  years I feel the same way Everyday feels like its exactly the same to me I am a robot wandering about this earth But trust me hard work pays off You seem like you have the weight of the world on your shoulders Just take a deep breathe and relax Who cares if your a virgin So what Would you rather have an STD My point is just dont be so hard on yourself Everyone your age has barely started adulthood What i mean by that is take the most promiscuous person from high school and how many times do you think they have had sex not as many times as you think Just take a deep breath I'm  and sometimes still think like why bother with life  I'd rather be dead but you know what I'm going to keep trying When you start to focus on your own death at such a young age people dont want to hangout with you They are at the age where they are enjoying and living life I've been there before trust me Please dont let the years go by Before you know it you'll be my age saying  damn i should have done this or that Don't keep looking at the past all the time Don't stress about what the future has to bring whatever happens happens and you have to live in the present Its a very hard confusing time in your life trust me i know But all the parties and shit wont mean anything in a few years Really what are u missing out on Drunk high people screaming at each other and backstabbing each other Maybe focus on like school or something before its too late Im just now getting back into school because it was like every year something would come up i had to deal with Just make a plan and reach for the sky

I think of myself as an excellent tactician and a lousy strategist That's ADHD for me I'm a great lieutenant and a poor general and I'm betting my bosses would agree with me I think we're great under pressure We're awesome on the fly our brains are wired for it Planning and building the plane we'd suck Flying the thing as things are happening we'd shine                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
If played it once with friends it got me out and about for the first time in months But I haven't played it since I live in a rural area so it's not very good unless we drive to the city                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
 so this morning I didn't have D so I ate Taco Bell Which was probably a mistake since I haven't had anything like that in a week and a couple hours later I had a little D I'm PRAYING it's from where I haven't eaten something like that in a week                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Take it's celebrated all around the world and everyone is with loved ones or friends the whole thing is way more present tgan vd                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
My I didn't have any trouble with this because I the girl and therefore the person traditionally expected to have opinions on this subject was the one who decided I didn't want an engagement ring All my now husband had to do was stand there and radiate a general willingness to do whatever I wanted while I said so and nobody thought he was doing anything wrong for not buying me a ring because I manifestly didn't want one So I think your only real option here for stopping people being judgy at you is to delegate all discussions to your girlfriend if she can confidently claim that this is  what she wants and she hasn't been pressured into it that'll likely solve your problem and if she can't other people's opinions aren't really your problem y'know

No someone who looks at this sub daily but also smoke daily so I don't really have the authority to comment and don't usually But I just wanted to say thanks for telling your story I identify with a lot of your struggles and understand the reluctance when you don't like the habit but like yourself so much more when you're engaging in it I can say that anything you do while stoned is part of your personality anyway Weed can't make you a different person it's just about unlocking these things while sober Trying not to overdo it will almost inevitably lead to smoking more and more over a long period of time and you getting further away from being able to do these things while sober Good luck with your journey

Ugh have some outstanding advice here FIL is obviously one who likes to be in control and probably is not wanting his daughter to be married So he's stirring shit up I'd do this Have your parents come over for dinner and then unbeknownst to them have her invite her parents over And let them meet

I I will not take a sip of any alcohol today and I will be sure to call him bright and early at 8am tomorrow wishing him a happy new year and hangover I've learned that nobody can do it sobriety for you I've learned that I can't do anything about other people's drinking I've learned my decisions regarding alcohol are not going to change anyone else's views or use And I've learned a bit about resentments like calling someone at  a m to wish them a happy hangover This is a very tough time Stick it out you won't regret it Honestly if I need a reminder why I don't drink I stay at a party late and watch I've noticed for the most part people get real loud and real dumb Hang in there

Just some friction masturbate This is dangerously s because you might get to a police by where you don't want to stop Also spending time fantasizing and rubbing it some so you can have a wet dream isn't that different from jacking off Honestly there's not much difference between inducing a wet dream and masturbating

I wish I could tell you that it does but in my experience that would be a lie Sorry to say Naturally I can't speak for you though Who knows maybe you'll feel better in a week But for me it's hard to find meaning in anything There is not a single thing that I want in life Nothing matters I guess the one thing I want is a quick and peaceful death Either that or happiness but the latter seems rather unlikely Sorry if I sound too negative I don't want to further discourage you

Good been there It hurts A lot Sometimes I wished wish that I'd been raised religious so that I'd at least have some hope for an afterlife but I wasn't so I really don't That's a hard thing to come to terms with This might not be useful to you at all I'm honestly not sure why it was as useful for me as it was but thinking about possible afterlife scenarios somehow mitigated my fears when they were at their worst Just thinking okay  but what if    and expanding on it world building in my mind creating reincarnation situations and stuff Hell if you're concerned about the universe ending pick another universe You don't necessarily have to believe it or see it as legitimately plausible at all it's just weirdly calming or at least it was for me I've considered writing a story about my favorite scenario I think that's how I started thinking about it in the first place actually but that's not the point anymore The point is that I have something to distract myself from despair when things get bad Good luck I hope you find something that works for you soon

Yeah brains develop a tolerance for what we normally watch Eventually we need to escalate and watch more porn or watch different kinds of porn This can lead us to watch genre's of porn we never thought we'd watch Any abnormal fetishes start to subside once you stop watching porn The brain needs a few weeks to return to a normal and calm state of mind Get serious about getting clean and you start seeing improvements in a few weeks Recovery is possible I was addicted for over  years                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
that with a special partner is very different from masturbating even if you ejaculate Consider you're interactive no with a real person not just your daughter magic nation You're getting out of yourself and tending to the needs of your partner I hope not just yourself Sex leads to a release of oxytocin a neurochemical that helps bonding When you masturbate there's no one to bond with If you're with a significant other there is someone you want to bond with and someone who wants to do the same A one night stand would probably be different

you short time heals all wounds The first girl that broke my heart cheated on me twice After I found out the first time I took her back and then she did it again It was like getting stabbed in the back and then feeling her twist the knife I felt like I had nothing left She was on my mind every second of every day for months Then it was a few times a day and eventually I went a day without even thinking about her at all It took a few more girls and a few more broken hearts but I have found one who treats me well who makes me feel loved and who supports me

If normal Remember YOU get to define YOUR own definition of what normal is for you For me normal is not drinking or doing any kind of drugs Popular belief and our media culture leads us to believe that if you're not drinking or smoking then you're missing out and not having fun or taking part in what the masses are doing When to be quite candid many people don't drink on new years Many people give a holiday power and use it as a reason to have no limits and just be completely silly and irresponsible Enjoy your sober night

I last therapist was a jerk People change sometimes in ways nobody thought possible Coping is a good thing but not the only thing Besides if you won the lottery you would be so busy dealing with all the people who want some that you wouldn't have time for anything else Suddenly you would be the most popular person around Not in a good way But today you are a person with depression not the other way around                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Last could go days weeks without drinking but when I finally did I would drink entirely too much I got myself involved in a few dangerous situations relatively okay it was then I decided to quit The straw that broke the camels back was a bachelor party in las vegas that turned into a  day bender Ended up in the ER and staples in my head after slipping on some water at a pool party It was bad but I feel fortunate could have been so much worse

Not  is so fucking TRUE I know I would have these problems whether I was with someone or not but what's wrong with having someone who truly loves you in spite of your problems It's better than not having that                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay decided to start using Tinder because who knows maybe it'll be easier to talk to girls there I matched with a girl was very nervous to even start the conversation but forced myself to type in the hey she responded and we talked for maybe like a couple of hours about random stuff At the end of the conversation I pretty much asked hey  could we maybe move on to whatsapp  and she gave me her number Really wasn't any flirting involved I just sorta talked like I would with a friend I haven't said anything else to her yet but hoping to ask her out on a date or something tomorrow even though I have no idea how that should go Even though it might seem like nothing this is honestly significant for me because I have a hard time talking to anyone irl especially girls because I'm always afraid of rejection So even if nothing else comes from this at least now I have a little bit more confidence and can sorta copy some of the things that worked this time the next time I talk to a girl

Depending littletoottoot Unfortunately what you are going through is very common for a lot of survivors Some will believe and support you some will not There is so much misinformation about sexual assault and what consent is and isn't Add to that that most people don't want to be put in the position of thinking someone they know is capable of doing something so horrendous I's easier to blame the victim or think there must have been a mistake when there clearly wasn't Having a community like here or RAINN or therapy anywhere people will be able to understand your situation and provide support is good I always say despite how much therapy I can do a major key to recovery is having a good support network That could be family friends or even strangers on the internet who are there when you need them You are welcome to write as much or as little as you are comfortable The mods do our best to monitor the forum and remove any unhelpful remarks I wanted to caution you about requesting PMs from people We've had some incidents where predators will use posts here to contact and further harm our community members Use your judgement but if anyone tries to tell you what happened wasn't rape or was your fault in any way please report them and break off contact We usually ask posters to confine their interaction to their threads but we also understand that a great deal of healing can come from the personal connections people have made here The best I can say is to be on guard and never give out personal information that could identify you If you decide to PM somebody that's your choice of course All my best                                                                                                                                                             
Guys sleep habits changed during my detox period I had trouble falling asleep and I had trouble going back to sleep in the morning My mind would race with porn flashbacks I had to go to bed tired so that I would fall asleep faster And I would have to get out of bed early in the morning and not linger in bed thinking about porn After a couple months my brain chemicals normalized and my sleep patterns have normalized I usually sleep about     hours a night Some people who are still addicted and have depression issues usually need more sleep Their whole anatomy is depressed tired and worn out People who are hiding a secret from their wife or girlfriend are also worn out from the anxiety of being discovered I have no more fear of what my wife will find on my computer

I nothing wrong with only eating once or twice a day so long as you're getting the caloric intake you need for the day A banana and some tea definitely does not qualify this will force your blood sugar to go all wonky it'll also force your body to try to store and reserve more calories as it's tricked into going to famine mode Which pretty much defeats the purpose if you're trying to lose weight

Considering I am in agreement that sugar does not help I have went from drinking pop to gatorade to juice to sweet tea to unsweetened tea and water I have lost a considerable a mount of weight in a few months that is staying off I switch between Celestial seasonings tea to water and on rare occasions I have a chocolate milkshake but the majority of my drinks have no sugar Cutting sugar out of your drinks can help IMHO                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Congratulations much of what you've written rings TRUE for me you've characterized that feelining of indeterminate loss very well I keep wondering Is it too late to change the course of my life  I feel like I've lost that opportunity somehow I think for me the loss is a loss of the future more doors are closed than open I am still trying to get to the bottom of these mournful feelings of mine but they both massive and formless No matter how I cut it it's going to be difficult to get my arms around it I shall however persevere You offer so much to this community Cookietrousers Thank you                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
No the bottom line and this is going to sound cliche you have to listen to YOUR heart It's YOUR life to live not your parents I know it can be challenging to weed out the opinions of others when they seem so strong and make good points or suggestions but the reality is that you have to pursue and follow what your heart and gut is telling you to Your family isn't going to be attending university YOU are Please do what your initial instinct was and if your family is not happy then that is something they have to work with and come to accept But to not do what you feel for fear of what others think or say is just denying your needs and desires Happy new year

 im going to be a little hard on you alright Don't hate me I'm  and dated a girl for ten years since high school and she cheated on me The f d up part is she chested on me while i was visiting her own grandfather by myself in the hospital a day before he died Some girls just do not f I paid her rent helped her with her mother's death funeral and gave this girl everything She was the only girl i looked at So you can take it from me when i say that this woman is playing you If you stepped up for her vhild when it wasnt yours that makes you a fantastic guy really it does man I dont want you to think im knocking you for that But now she see's she has an income babysitter and she thinks she can do whatever she wants Just like my girl  oh hes at the hospital with my papa so i dont need to worry about that today  Hmm what should i do to pass the tine you get what i mean You seem like me one of the good guys This world has certain types of female that prey on guys like us They can't make up their f mind on which flavor of ice cream they want so they just try all of them I dont know the entire story obviously Dont let her string you along man Do you want to spend your whole life wondering if shes f another dude when your not around Sure i mean you have kids involved and you can act civil towards each other but she seems like she doesnt know what she wants unless its you to be around as the dad My advice is be the best damn dad u can be bro i dont have kids if it were me i would find another girl even if it takes a while Kids get attached to whoever u bring home so make sure u dont have like a different girl everynight you know just find a good girl who doesnt mess with you head and give u mixed signals like this one does They do exist the good guys like u n me have just got to find them                                                                                         
you is normal to be anxious at only four days After abusing my body for years it took awhile for it to find equilibrium I was tearful too and on an emotional roller coaster That's one of the reasons why I got lots of support from a therapist and AA It was easier and more fun to be sober with help

If then therapist and psyhciatrist described this to me like that anti depressants suppress your emotions which you actually need to feel in order to sort them out Therefore the more you take them the less you can get out of your therapy On the other hand they're very useful when you can't get much out of your therapy because emotions are too strong Based on that knowledge I'd consider it a good sign if they know how hard it is for you I assume you tell them and refrain from prescribing anything If in doubt just ask them if they think it would help you either with therapy or life in general                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
you your life purpose becomes more than trying to even chase after usually gold digging narcissistic women who shit and sweat like anyone else you'll have a much more fulfilling life Don't put women on a pedestal man If all men just treated women like anyone else we wouldn't have all these cucks who make the modern day beta male culture Live your life and if you fine a decent woman along the way congrats                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Welcome it keeps happening or you start pooping black tar please go Ask for a social worker and they will help you find a way to pay for your hospital stay and rehab Also as far as your family goes I hid my problem from mine for years and I understand how you feel now The thing is either they already know something is up or it's only a matter of time before something catastrophic happens and they find out Don't let that stop you from getting what you need to get better More often than not if you're trying to get better before you ruin your relationships they're generally pretty supportive

 don't think I can give up the weed Some people might not understand but I can honestly say it has saved me from depression and suicidal thoughts But smoking cigarettes will be something that will not continue I hope the best to you in the years to come

Im hate to admit it but I do feel better after a drink It only takes one for me because I'm small and don't drink often I get a little light headed and laugh easier and care less I only have a drink when I'm feeling particularly shitty and can't escape negative thoughts like tonight for instance It's kind of a last resort because I hate the taste and usually feel a little groggy the next day                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
 recommend Crash Course Psychology as an introduction can't really speak for any other sources As for Crash Course the series I've watched parts of are well done and some of the biology related episodes have been used in my university lectures If you enjoy CC Psychology you might want to consider psych electives or possibly psych as your main area of study if you choose to do post secondary education Other youtube channels I cannot recommend without first having seen them and my youtube hobbies don't include channels based around psychology There's also the problem of psychology being a field that public interacts with regularly regardless of whether the information is accurate and the field has changed dramatically in the past  years You might run into problems if you don't know if the channel is accurate in what they put out Ted talks if you like the subject can be rather interesting The only problem with Ted talks is that occasionally you do get ideas spoken of that don't make sense or are not accurate I think there was an article about one talk being effectively rescinded Definitely more likely to be accurate than youtube but the topics can be quite narrow Consider getting an introductory psychology textbook you can often find them used online for the cost of a new release video game or less You may also be able to borrow one from a friend's sibling if they majored in psychology I've actually found the majority of my psych textbooks to be on the easier side for reading and thoroughly enjoyed all but a couple Edit If you do go buying a psych textbook stick to the most recent edition or the most recent previous edition psychology has dramatically changed in the past  years and is one of the more rapidly changing disciplines                                                                                                                                               
 reason for not allowing advertising yourself as a helper is that it's a slap in the face to the OPs who've poured their hearts out and asked for help There are always people who have not received enough good responses why not reply to them The reason for not allowing helpers to invite PMs as a first resort is that there's no reason for someone who's legitimately here to help to avoid scrutiny of their comments by the community                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
 there your husband sounds a lot like me The two things that have helped me most are couple's therapy and exercise Therapy has helped my neurotypical partner and I understand each other much better and make changes that feel fair to both of us I do kickboxing   times per week and the interactions there are related to kickboxing I don't feel much pressure to interact beyond that but it still feels like I am a part of something Relationships feel very exhausting to me but having casual acquaintances based on a common interest works very well I have  best friends I've kept since high school my partner and family members and they are usually more than enough It's wonderful that you are so supportive of your husband and are willing to learn I'd say try to be patient with him if you have to repeat yourself my partner often does because I get intensely focused on something else encourage him to try new things without forcing them upon him and accept that he'll always be different and that's okay There are a lot of valuable resources created by and for those on the spectrum I found some great videos on YouTube Maybe you two can check those out together Oh And regarding the paranoia I've misinterpreted other people A LOT in the past It's helpful when people gently challenge those interpretations and offer alternative interpretations This might take a while to overcome but after many years of experiencing paranoia and anxiety I am finally getting more comfortable and able to cope I hope this helps

I is a terrific response I love how much hope and encouragement you have given how hard all of this is I really like your strategies and that you were able to make new supportive friends A good chunk of healing work is helping your mind to re focus sometimes forcibly onto positive things You exercised this idea really well                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Yea you herniate a disc your back is never the same again I have a severe herniation in my l5 s1 disc When it flares up the sciatica is unlike any pain I've ever experienced Even the IV dilaudid I got in the hospital barely touched the pain I can go a year or two with no issues and then it will just hit me out of nowhere You have to be incredibly careful with physical activity The wrong twist bend can irritate the disc and you're back to square one What sort of treatment did you get Did you do the epidural guided steroid injections

The masturbating without ejaculating The idea is you get close the edge of ejaculating but stop calm down and start again It is masturbating and it can be difficult to resist the urge to just let it all go That's why most people will tell you not to do it Whether you need a reset is up to you                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
I here The info you've given seems a bit strange to me The first thought would be to guess a genetic predisposition to high cholesterol hereditary familial hypercholesterolemia but that could suggest one or both of your parents would also have high cholesterol so do they Plus given your size you're not close to being obese by a large margin your GP probably should've would've thought to test for it if it was warranted A reading of  That's vague Is that total cholesterol LDL I used to drink   glasses of milk per day and eat eggs every other day which I cut down to  glasses a day and eggs every week Drinking   glasses of milk every day and eating eggs every other day will not result in high cholesterol levels in an otherwise healthy person i e someone without a genetic anomaly My mom said I needed to go vegan for a while is she right No She's wrong And no offence but something sounds off with this situation Your mother has some very strange beliefs with regards to your diet Did she insist you start exercising exercise more or did she just start imposing these dietary restrictions From now on I would be insisting that your GP deal directly with you and ask him her to explain what they think is going on I also find it very strange that your doctor has offered no treatment plan you mention that changes to your diet were made by your mother not your doctor if your cholesterol is indeed so dangerously high You should not be cutting fat entirely from your diet in fact it's been well established that you need fat in your diet to maintain a healthy body Cut unhealthy not healthy fats EDIT Typos                                                                                                                                                      
As great method I use is taking a cold shower before bed that really subdues my cravings for porn and helps me to get to sleep

Friend my case I think it would end up being I left the button on the table   I am too lazy to go get the button which might still offer the split second to calm down but I'm pretty good at dismissing things in record time and going back to the freaking out part

FUCK can't you go to a professional Is your OCD not being treated at all If that's the case it'll just move onto a new theme if you beat this one That's my experience anyway                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Don't you SO much I totally appreciate all of this advice I was in the middle of a Fry's department store when I read this and my anxiety was just running rampant But looking at quotes was incredibly helpful It helped me ground myself a little and made me look at myself objectively and not through my haze of emotions I'm just getting started on mindful meditation but it's hard to find time to just concentrate on that and not on the hundreds of other things that I do in my day I'll have to make it a priority in the new year Thanks again                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Congratulations  and I've never had a sip of alcohol either Ultimately it's up to you but my opinion is you shouldn't have to drink alcohol to have fun or to have a social life

My says the person with  days Keep it to yourself That was the point of this comment chain I'm four years in and haven't masturbate once but I never make posts like this will be the best year ever or change comes from within  You're either going to do it or not and I would rather people just shut up and do it than keep posting pointless threads psyching themselves up because they relapsed and want people to pat them on the back for their short term failure Just get back on the horse and pipe down I don't post a thread on r bicycling every time I fall off my bike why should this be any different

I you it didn't even occur to me to really seek medical advice but you're right Thanks for your help it's so hard to function when I can't feel my hands hahaha                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
That sorts of posts aren't really appropriate on stopdrinking for a few reasons One these posts tend to turn into one up contests where people will eventually try and top each other in terms of how bad or what sort of depraved stuff they've done It's not about comparing bottoms Two someone who may be thinking they need to re evaluate their own issues will see these posts and then compare themselves to some of the stuff here and think 'well ive never shit myself in the middle of a Denny's so i might not have a problem' and then continue to drink and let things get worse These types of posts can actually lengthen the amount of time someone lurking spends drinking because they think they're not as bad as X or Y yet And it doesn't have to be rock bottom for someone to get support for quitting drinking

So is right WE only ourselves have control over our actions By choosing to learn how to understand your emotions feelings you then understand what reaction becomes the best option Nothing of that becomes instantly the right choice but we learn through our mistakes and experience We choose to become a more aware person we choose to see things light or dark Nobody else                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
 a thought  If you're pretty sure it's a bot and will show you porn don't open it You might be fooling yourself opening it hoping to see a hot pic  If you're pretty sure you know it's a real person you know and want to add them to your account but it was a trick then it's an accident Now why you do what you do Intention is a key factor in deciding whether it's a relapse

I started with the diagnosis of ADHD Then from there it only got worse I got worse We attribute that now to psych medications Next it was bipolar II Then it was Bipolar I Then bipolar I rapid cycling Then schizoaffective disorder My meds were the cause to my worsening condition instead of helping because I was misdiagnosed all along I recently got the right diagnosis and am doing very well considering all I went through Given my experience i encourage people to be proactive with telling your doctors how you are doing and what you think could be most beneficial Question everything and stay as informed and honest as you can It gets better                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Did get you I tried to reach out to my parents telling them how I didn't want to live in  My mother's response She went on to tell me about how she had just programmed the DVD player and ignored my confessing that I planned to kill myself                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Nice me be PERFECTLY CLEAR you are getting fucked These are NOT petty issues AT ALL I'd be shaking mad if I were you I live in Massachusetts and if you go to full time work to part time work you can file for unemployment I'd check on your states rules for this Look for another job RIGHT AWAY Keep this one of course but start putting together your portfolio now This is completely unacceptable DO NOT make the rookie mistake of taking another job on the days that you a scheduled off They'll schedule you for the days that took the other job and then say 'You worked here first where are your priorities ' Understand rule  about work It's all about YOU Your money your growth your standard of living PERIOD This is an opportunity for you it really is You will stand up for yourself and that is so impowering PS Fuck that asshole Jim                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
 was thinking this a lot yesterday What the actual fuck goes on inside us Why do our brains want us to suffer It doesn't make any fucking sense Mental illness really sucks and I wish it would all just fuck off for everyone So many people crippled by mental illness are often the kindest smartest most creative and generous people out there and it's so saddening that this kind of shit happens to them I hope some day in the future there will be something to permanently rid someone of mental illness I hope everyone has a better year and more luck in fighting your problems in   was goddamn hell buy I believe in all of you that y'all can beat this shit                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 recently turned off notifications for my messaging app and won't open it until I need it I know it shouldn't make a difference because no one messaged me anyway but it feels like I'm taking back a small amount of control No longer messaging people and not getting a reply No longer checking people's last seen time to decide if they're busy or ignoring me No longer playing a game I can't win My time can be better spent                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
What you for the comment I don't know a lot of people who have my experience of weed Most people I know just experience the couch lock and the giggles They can barely think let alone work write and be productive I don't like getting high with other people so much They are always easier to smoke another one when I'm really done for the day

It on mobile and can't talk much but I really didn't want to forget about your post I'll try to add more later But basically you're not a social justice warrior A sjw is someone who is not always suffering from a mental health disorder or been traumatized They are the types to want to silence everybody and shut them up if they feel they are saying something that would hurt them or a generalized perception of a large group of people They appropriated the term trigger from post traumatic stress disorder which caused it to lose all meaning Trigger for them could literally be anything triggering any emotion not just a ptsd flashback or severe anxiety atrack Often times sjws claim different opinions are triggering to shut them up unfairly Eg Someone says they don't like then feminist movement SJWs are very angry and hateful and yell a lot The term mutated from keyboard warrior which was just a realky angry person having an unternet fight Not all feminists are even sjws it's the super angry hateful people who you can't even talk too What you're suffering is an anxiety and what you've described are the mechanics and patterns of avoidant behavior from anxiety It's all just a normal part of anxiety and it doesn't mean you're like the type of people who get called sjws at all You're not a pussy or weak either Anxiety is so powerful because it was a survuval mechanism for us The internet can seem black and white but there are a lot of moderate and sensible people out there You're one of them yourself and you're on a place right now full of people who understand Also since I'm already talking about this I figure it won't hurt too say this I don't like the people you described either because with safe spaces and self censorship I see them self inflicting and self imposing severe anxiety upon themselves which I have been through because I live with cripplling agoraphobia from ptsd and autism It's so sad

This healthy is a good but you're not going to get laid a gf just because you have abs I thought that too years ago and it doesn't help at all if you still have social anxiety and don't talk to people much I'd also temper your expectations as far as getting ripped goes unless you plan on juicing it's going to take years to get to where you want                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
 which case realism would be seeing yourself as a low level person I don't know if there are levels of people but please explain

I I'm so sorry about that I'm in a similar boat Alone on New Years It's fucking depressing and I'm seriously considering drinking a fuck load just to rid these emotions And I've actually never been drunk before                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Linkin  I'd be done for the day already by now if I had had a drink

Okay a lot of doom and gloom on this thread about the impending ruination of your life i advise you not to trudge into your future carrying this unnecessary burden the doom c yes you're very young to have a baby but you seem fairly resilient looking to the future rather than bemoaning the past and resolved to carry on i was friends with a woman some years ago whose daughter got unexpectedly pregnant in the last year of high school there was some drama sure but the family eventually rallied around well except the father who ghosted they bought her a condo and helped her pay for day care while she finished her college education my friend did a lot of babysitting and teaching her daughter how to be a mom and my friend bitched about it from time to time but here's the deal everyone in the family loved that baby and everyone pitched in difficult timing but not disastrous in itself so should you and gf see this through to the child's birth i advise you to enjoy the hell out of your child's early life because that time really is gone in a flash the rest of it you'll work out good luck                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
I exactly are you quite sure it is exactly as you've described it How familiar are you with the molecular mechanisms behind the changes in the brain caused by psilocybin Do you have any research that supports your claim Just believing in something without evidence isn't good enough for science that's just faith which has exactly as much credibility as superstition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
MY also do not believe in luck I just use the word as a good thing

Man lemon When I know clients I see are having a hard time talking about what happened and it's nearly always the sexual aspects I encourage them to keep a journal It's easier to write down thoughts feelings memories ideas and let yourself ramble when it's only you I think one of the reasons online forums can be so helpful is because we are anonymous which frees you up to write anything From there you can begin bringing pieces into your therapist to look at together talk about Sometimes clients will just read to me with a stone face the details of what they went through Other times it's just one haunting thought they can't shake Writing is a great addition to the healing process I've had clients hand me scribbled notes that say show this to ChildTherapist with just a sentence or two on them Our sexuality and sexual abuse can get very very mixed up together in painful and odd ways It's sometimes embarrassing to talk about the thoughts and memories we have Talk with your therapist about what you need to make it safe in the room to say what you need to Maybe there is something they can do to help you feel safe and contained while you talk I won't sit here and say you will get past it but I believe absolutely that you CAN It's hard and I truly know how much it hurts but you can move past this and have it be a memory that's less painful All my best                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Wanted advice but im not even overthinking things im just in a permanent stage of feeling like shit and whenever i try to fake feeling good or try engaging myself even if i can do it for a little bit it doesnt make me feel like ive achieved anything and i just go back to my original state

Please sounds like the typical issue with raising a dose not lowering The comment from RNwrites is likely spot on Take it everyday for   days and see how it goes because it will likely stabilize and the headaches should be gone Are you drinking enough water You should be drinking at least half a gallon of water throughout the day especially on Vyvanse Dehydration can easily lead to headaches worsen headaches Also that  dose sounds like it was low When I started  it would wear off faster and I would get a similar brain fog irritability feeling

Let going to eat ramen and then off to a movie Going with a normie friend who doesn't drink I considered staying in entirely but I thought doing something that didn't involve alcohol might be better Thanks everyone for being here                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Why only way to stop the craving is to not feed it Every time you watch porn you feed it Every time you turn away from porn you starve it As it starves it gets desperate and fights harder so you have to fight harder and smarter Get away from temptations Find other hobbies spend more time with friends or family Keep starving it till there's nothing left I haven't watched porn in a long time a year or more I can't say that I never have an urge but it's not like it used to be The urges to watch are few and far between

I Played a bit of Doom Late last night ran across a improv comedy club doing a NYE show with appetizers and desserts catered and a toast at the  marks of NYE in the US Wavered on it but really proud that I bought a ticket and am heading out to it in an hour

For know exactly how you feel  was a huge shitshow for me too but as people say once you've hit rock bottom there's only one way to go                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
You're use to watch videos all the time but then again I'm realizing it's just pointless and a waste of time Unfortunately there's nothing else for me to do So yeah

Don't know what you ought to do Just stand up straight with your chest out and say I am a man and realize that you have the power to change your future and to come out from the darkness but it's gonna take multiple steps and you'll never succeed if you stop trying SO DON'T STOP TRYING because there is no hope elsewhere You must keep trying because once you give up you are at the bottom and you can only go up from there

Id thing I like the most about your goal of working out is that you said you're doing it for yourself not specifically to find a partner People who focus on aesthetics and have the mindset of I have to get ripped in order to find a SO usually end up giving up on a routine a month or two in I had a conversion with my sister's boyfriend one of the nicest most rational people I've met over Christmas and his words stuck with me Don't do it for anyone but yourself  Do it for your health  do it for your own motivation  A lot of people who don't see progress just give up  Keeping fit is not only good for your body but for your mental well being as well  It's been a long time since I last had a workout routine I feel the same way as you because I'm scrawny and feel like everybody's watching me at the gym I've just started to do calisthenics at home every day for at least  minutes Pop in some tunes while you do it and it will fly by Once you start to build a routine for yourself and stick with it for a couple weeks it'll start to become second nature

I husband has hemi plegic migraines with aura and it has never been confused with any sort of mental illness He gets the odd flashing lights loss of motor skills tingling on one side of the body and is unable to effectively communicate when he has one However given your history I would trust your doctors diagnosis                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Totally just a very responsible doctor keeping tabs on your son since that is a very high dose The standard top range is 30mg but it doesn't mean that you overdose at doses higher than that I was on a dose higher than 30mg for a while Even when I was at 15mg and 20mg my psychiatrist had me in for periodic EKG's just to check things out Many psych medications can have cardiac implications it's just kind of the risk many of them have The class that abilify is in is known for having a small risk of an abnormal rhythm an abnormal ECG and sudden low blood pressure when standing up Those symptoms are not generally super serious but it has caused the medical community to be considerably more cautious about other potential cardiovascular issues that could be present especially in someone who may not be aware of any underlying issues It sounds very much like your son's doctor is being responsible There is no such thing as a no risk psych med There is no Tylenol of the psych world Some antidepressants are fairly benign and have few side effects and people can go about fairly normally with them Any other class of med in the psychiatric world comes with risk and side effects that are somewhat unpleasant Usually the illness they are treating is more unpleasant and so we take the meds Abilify is honestly one of the more tolerable of the bunch They sort of start getting less desirable from there

 I get it it is extremely liberating to be told that no it's not all in your head well it is but you know what I mean and that you're not just the laziest person ever You get told you're so smart   you're not living up to your potential enough times you start believing it I was ecstatic to learn that there were other people out there like me reading this sub is such a get out of my head  experience I feel instant compassion empathy for pretty much everyone that posts on this sub I don't think my meds changed me in any way that could be seen as negative I am also on SSRIs and those fucked me up way more than Adderall Vyvanse did Zoloft turned me into an emotional zombie And I bet if you told your mom you had anxiety depressive issues she'd have no problem with you going on an SSRI Meds did change my kids I am so thankful for those changes Prozac helps my daughter not think that every thing she encounters is looking to kill her Without Prozac she wouldn't eat I will choke on this Did that rock on the sidewalk just fly into my mouth Is this poison You'd be surprised at the amount of backseat parenting I get on my decision to give an  year old SSRI meds As far as I'm concerned there was no decision to be made Something wasn't working right and there was a solution to that I used the solution She is also on ADHD meds Again there is a problem and there is a solution It is not a perfect solution but it is one Without those meds my daughter would do the most dangerous impulsive things Shove her hand in front of a strange dog's jaw to pet it without stopping to think ask Run into the middle of the road to get the ball without thinking about uh   are there any cars coming  She'd probably randomly accept candy from a stranger in a van She basically reacted first thought later So yeah the meds changed her They help her think first act later They also somewhat stunt her growth but I'm told eventually it catches up and ruins her appetite for lunch I personally take that as a positive because I have an extra  pounds on me but she has none to spare Even with those negatives I'd rather have a skinny kid that is alive and doing well in school than a kid that ran into traffic got into a van but was half an inch taller with a better appetite P My son was just diagnosed with high functioning autism and ADHD He started meds too and it changed him as well He went

A the same experience not too long ago I don't know how old you are but chances are you are around   ish Now the thing that saved me was the realization that i had all the time in the world to become another person The feeling of urgency to achieve something is usually nothing more than that a feeling You can't get a great job a nice family etc in an instant Try to take it slow and do small steps towards your goals you'll reach them eventually Everyone has got something they can do like nobody else so please try and put it to good use                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
After really sorry you have had so face these things loneliness can feel both so crippling and claustrophobic You mentioned you tried medication Because these things can often take months to have an effect I'm sure you know that but I thought I would just mention in case Do you enjoy co op games I assume and driving listing to music Because if so it great that you at least have some outlet Which games and music do you like

its wow Powerful post and right where I am now except it's  46pm The imposter syndrome runs strong in us addicts and that's what I have to remind myself all the time                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
If the same thoughts earlier today You aren't alone in this tonight                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
God kind of been in denial about my problem with this let's gooo                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
I'm is worse Yet I still click through each and every story of people having a good time                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
My statistic that I commonly use in groups is that on average a person in recovery relapses seven times That's not permission to relapse seven times nor does it mean everyone relapses seven times some will relapse more times than that some less and some never The purpose of this is to illustrate that relapse happens In a perfect world it wouldn't but this is a far from perfect world The best we can do is try to understand what heightens our own risks for relapse and work to lower those risks for ourselves                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
I'm biggest change I felt was after  weeks I stopped having dopamine flood into my bloodstream for no reason Once my body stopped fighting me then things started to get a little easier I still had the mental battle but no more overwhelming white knuckle urges To be honest I couldn't see all the improvements that I was making My wife would tell me that I laugh more or point out we just had an emotional conversation and I didn't yell I would also realize in retrospect that I stopped feeling angry or mad for no reason at all The timetable for everyone's recovery is different There are a lot of factors that determine when certain phases start and stop Whether it happens fast or slow we still have to endure and stay clean no matter what

Thanks for the reply I don't know the full situation because I never speak to the doctor they call my mom and give her the blood test results a few days after I test I asked her what my actual levels were and she replied I think it was 219    I have no idea what it means but I can ask her when I see her later No offence taken She says I need to start eating healthier she didn't really say anything about exercising The doctor has never told me anything specifically but I change doctors often so that may be why My mom is the only one who tells me that my cholesterol is high she just says after my blood test Your cholesterol is really really high Jay  we need to fix it or something like that                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
 little over three weeks here I had some anxiety spikes and was worried I'd have nightmares but so far every dream I've had has been so vivid and wonderful and it's as if they're all trying to tell me something and I find much joy and wisdom in picking them apart                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Nice bestof material right here                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Aww don't think it's over thinking I think you personally have some issue with someone authentically trying to pay you compliments or interact with you positively Now I don't know how people do interact with you could be that it's really fake and worthless but it sounds like your boss was truly paying you a compliment honestly and that you can't accept that When I got some progress on my SA it surprised me the kind of people I chose to be around during it It felt comfortable and good to be with people who weren't really positive or interacting authentically It sounds like maybe you have friends who belittle you or at least aren't  positive people It also sounds like you can't speak your TRUE feelings if you get to the point where you are verbally assaulting them in your head That is something you ought to talk to someone about and work out Because you should either be able to handle situations where that happens or you should feel free to say the things you want to say or you should be able to pick people to be around who won't treat you like that Not blaming you for any of it just saying it sounds like a viewpoint that you'd be much happier healthier working on                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Your worry about it too much I drank that much if not more and had no serious withdrawals There were some effects for a few weeks but nothing that made me even consider seeing a doctor At worst I had some serious brain fog but that lifted after a couple weeks Granted everyone is different and I'm no doctor which if you have any doubts you should see one It's part of their job to be discreet and honestly they don't give a flying fuck if you're an alcoholic trying to quit they're just there to help you be healthy Forget about the drawbacks let's talk about some of the good things When was the last time you had real honest to god sober sleep For me it had probably been over a decade Then about  weeks sober around the time the brain fog lifted I started sleeping like a baby Waking up from that sleep was the most satisfying feeling ever better than any night of drunk partying or one night stands Then I stopped getting heartburn every day My stomach started to even out and I could take real poops again Then there was the weight loss and on and on and on I know making the choice to quit drinking is scary but don't let it stop you from getting sober by getting hung up on the bad stuff and start thinking about all of the good that can come from it Seriously take some time to write down the pros and cons of sobriety and then the pros and cons of drinking See how they stack up Here's what's even better I'm still discovering new pros for sobriety all the time things I never even thought of while I was drinking All I can remember discovering while I was drinking was reasons to quit Best of luck to you my friend and Happy New Year

This done eight months in the past Those eight months were pretty good I lost weight got a new job became somewhat social and generally felt confident Then another rejection made me give up I don't know if any of the benefits were down to no fap or not but I'm going to try again because my life has become worse than ever Also I've never combined no fap super powers with my wizard powers I could become unstoppable

No everyone has their own way of getting over their struggles and it is simultaneous rude and counter productive when you and others belittle those who use religion to deal with their particular issues                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
My so glad that you are in a better situation I hope your benefits are sorted out soon Is there a food pantry you can visit in the mean time I think you are the only one who can make the right choice about whether to have a baby or not If that's what you want I wish you the best I am not a mother but hope someday I will be There are many joys you will find No one will pretend that there aren't hard times too but for people who want kids the joys far outweigh the challenges In my case I am very thankful that I didn't get pregnant I was extremely careful with birth control especially after realizing how abusive my abuser was I'll admit that I was terrified to see his characteristics in my child I was terrified that nurture might not be able to overcome nature and have no idea which parts of his personality are nature nurture I truly hope that your child grows up in a loving home and never exhibits any negative characteristics you saw in your ex I wish you the very very best Good luck getting back on your feet And Congratulations

Yes you can't do this and you're not ready for it then don't do it Say no Your mother is probably worried about your future and this is her way of trying to make sure that you're provided for You can provide for yourself Find a job and save your money If you're not allowed to work find a job and say you're going to school You can take care of yourself and you can prove it to your mother and yourself Entering into a marriage or any committed relationship moving in with someone before you are self sufficient and know who you are and what you need in a partner is asking for heartbreak and misery It's your life Make it what you want it to be Now is the time You have your entire life ahead of you Make it the one you want

I much trauma at such a young age You're not in a good place to put it lightly and it's completely understandable that you'd feel as you do You're no attention whore your feelings are very real and ought to be taken seriously If you have a plan or if you feel you are ready to end it please seek immediate medical attention You may feel so alone right now so hopeless so lost that you see no other way out of the pain but to end it all I want you to know that there are alternatives that this doesn't have to be the end that there is another way Please seek help Talk to a counselor at school try to get into therapy Hang in there

Yeah number  I honestly stopped giving a shit Surprisingly I am decent at talking to others but I will never approach them I simply don't feel like it Instead I choose to spend my time reading things or daydreaming to my music I figure like either my pills will make me feel better enough to want to talk to others or I'll be alone for a long time cope as best I can maybe suicide I honestly feel as if I don't really care since my days may be numbered More importantly though I enjoy not forcing myself to do anything I don't want to do

honestly my birthday I hate my birthday because growing up people were never around They always had NYE plans never got invited because I wasn't much of a drinker I wish I was born a day or two after or before Nofap has made me feel more lonely then I ever have And now even though I have my fam it's so difficult to feel wanted PMO would medicate this feeling but it either aggravated a problem that was always there or created it can't tell which yet It's been so long I'm gonna ride it out and see how much of me is salvaged So now my birthdays are just movies and dinners Why would I want to do anything else by myself And as much as I love my family there's something depressing about not having anyone else non familial to hang with Nevertheless good things are happening So although you are literally alone please know that you're not alone in you loneliness see what I did there I'm alone Countless others are alone we grit and bare it and move on to the next day We're holding out for something better

can't completely up to you to do or not If you do however I recommend starting light with your consumption just try a beer or two and avoid hard liquor on your first go Should help you from getting super drunk unless you can't hold your alcohol very well Of course there's always the possibility you may just not like how alcohol tastes and will choose to avoid it anyway like me

Congrats to both The problem is that as soon as one doc mentioned bipolar nobody would listen to me anymore I kept pointing out that a hypomanic episode is a requirement of bipolar disorder and any very rare"highs" I've had were fairly normal doesn't anybody ever get to be really happy when life is good and could usually be attributed to medications What kept tripping me up was the racing thoughts I took that to mean my normal super busy mind that never stops but that isn't what they meant apparently ADHD seemed to make more sense but didn't explain it all Most of my issues now can be attributed to anxieties that no doc ever treated despite anxiety and depression being my primary complaints Really got sick of the mental health care game

Welcome Firstly I would like to say that I am incredibly sorry that this was the opening to the new year It sucks I'm sending virtual hugs you must be having a very tough time Secondly I'm a disabled person physically mentally too but my physical illness is invisible and I believe that people who have depression have the exact same rights to claim disability as people who are disabled physically Think about this that way I get money because I can't work due to spinal pain you can't work due to mental pain But pain is pain no matter what form Please please don't feel bad about claiming disability allowance I believe that your parents are doing the right thing by splitting up if they're unhappy however I completely understand how that would affect you on a deeply emotional level And while I haven't been through this my best friend has and I promise you that it's not as bad as it seems They'll be happier and soon you will too I think that you should take time to grieve you have every right to be upset Don't let this define the upcoming year for you It'll be like any other year it'll have its ups and downs but in majority of events you still get to turn it around I hope I haven't said anything that will upset you I wish you all the best I know everything is super tough right now but it won't stay like this If you need anyone to talk to at any stage feel free to pm me

Someone The small things are getting so enjoyable already I had a terrible sleep last night too tossing and turning with no comfort hot with the blanket on cold with the blanket off Wake up and think I haven't been sleeping at all Yet I still have more energy today than I normally do when I wake n bake Thanks for the encouragement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Hope Daisy I read your post and had to reply right away First congrats on the life choice And I do mean LIFE choice At this precise moment on new years eve I sit in bed with my partner lying next to me asleep Or at least what used to be her  years ago when she came back into my life after being absent for like  years she had become a heavy drinker For  years I watched her drink a bottle of Vodka a day waiting for her to decide to stop  months ago after being hospitalized for  days because she couldn't keep any food down and had bloody diareah she was admitted for acute liver failure pancreatitis malnutrition low potassium and a number of other things in spite of the doc telling her it would kill her if she drank again she went home and drank anyway Only now she switched to wine figuring it wouldn't be as bad as Vodka That lasted about a week And then she just stopped  days after she stopped she was still throwing up and unable to eat But what really concerned me was she was starting to be confused about things Swearing she had seen and talked to people she had not for example I started doing some research Skip to now Google Wernickes Korsakoff Syndrome Because of the way is presents it was not caught right away and because her doctor was a douche it also wasn't treated properly Now my partner is  years old and will have permanent brain damage for the rest of her life From heavy drinking Based on what you have said I strongly suggest that you seek medical assistance with your decision to quit Detoxing is tremendously painful with alcohol and if you are alone you could have a heart attack or something with no one around If you don't see a doc then at least recruit a friend Good luck                                                                                                                       
 what if the things you learned werent good things I learned to never trust anyone I learned to never let anyone into your heart because they will surely destroy it I learned to never open up People will only hurt you beyond recognition Those aren't lessons a girl is supposed to learn Those aren't good lessons

Why more about the total number of required hours Oregon requires  direct contact couples family hours with  being eligible for transfer from an internship https www oregon gov oblpct Pages experience aspx I didn't license in Oregon so if that's wrong someone please correct me Washington requires  contact hours but only  of them have to be with couples families and you can transfer in  hours from a masters program The rules are vaguely worded as 500 hours can be transferred from an AAMFT approved master's program but for practical purposes people split the hours as   individual couples

Masturbating does yes I'm not after her I couldn't even bring myself to do that Her Fiance respects me and is happy that she has someone else to talk to on a personal level And I respect him We are good friends not lovers Only a dirtbag would try and steal a women like that I agree that it is temporary and even necessary It's just tough to deal with and I have honestly never felt it this strongly before so it's even harder                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Yeah me know if you have any updates You should get it checked out anyway The pain and the blood could be two separate reasons Just go to the doctor and get yourself checked It's not worth waiting and worrying I had issues with other organs and after months of specialists and worry of potential cancer it turned out to be mild spinal nerve damage that is alright now Just get it checked out If it was serious which it probably isn't time by the day is precious for many reasons If it's not serious you'll get some meds and sort it out So just go hope all goes alright Don't be scared to go to the doctor because you're worried about what he will say is wrong Time is precious when it comes to things like this But you genuinely could just have a fissure or something

Yeah don't think people without add ADHD will ever truly understand people who have the condition no matter how open minded they are For those ppl who impose their opinion on add ADHD people well I just don't think they worth our attention                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Clearly will only make psychosis worse Another option is extensive therapy for your sister and your mother

There are overthinking this You like him and it sounds like he is comfortable enough to open up about personal issues and enjoys hanging out with you Guys are not as complex as you probably think If I were you I would just look for more opportunities to hang out with him outside of class or school related activities Maybe go see a movie or go out for a drink somewhere

I to me according to the framework provided that youre doing activities for the sake of becoming social instead of doing something you enjoy that involves other people Idk maybe find something that only has one or two other ppl instead of a large group We're not experts here try a variety of approaches TLDR Sounds like you should try more things you enjoy

I've to your parents buddy Approximately  hours ago I was feeling very very down and suicidal about total misunderstandings and misreading things that were said happened over Christmas I was racking my brain for hours how I was going to ask my brother about those things that had been plaguing me since then I got it into my head that my brother would kick off on the phone saying something like how dare you think of us like that  He caught me off guard whilst I was planning what to say and he phoned me so just said what I had to say but asked him not to be angry before hand I also explained that what I had to ask him may seem trivial even stupid You know what buddy It turns out that neither him his wife or their son meant the things that I though they had with the way they looked at me when I said whatever or what they meant when they said whatever And I'm  and it's still very difficult for me But don't let that make you think that it's all gonna be bad even by my age Chances are it won't Hang in there and tell your parents I have Asperger's and so social situations are extremely difficult for me In the end all was sorted I apologised and we said happy New Year to each other and with that said that saw the end of  Don't worry about a phone I know you don't know me but I have shit loads of spare phones if you want one You matter not material objects They in time can be replaced you can't

Well to me like youre problem lies more in staying in the coversation You should practice asking questions When ppl seem like theyre ignoring you try interjecting with questions that actually steer the conversation

What okay to feel that way I know you've probably heard plenty of when I was your age comments but really when I was your age I felt the same way Sometimes it takes a little longer to figure out where you fit you know But at  you can do anything be anyone Sometimes you have to focus on yourself and just doing things that you like and following whatever inspires you at that moment and let all the other stuff figure itself out as you go

RISE see what you mean makes sense yes And I know how you feel But just because it's your bpd talking it doesn't mean it's not you It's part of who you are no one is pulling strings On the bright side with therapy you can improve and control those things                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Believe I agree with what your saying I guess I'm stuck on her because we have two kids together and so much history I've done so much for her from getting her any car she wanted cash in hand along with a house that she picked out and putting food on the table along with a roof over our heads I know she wants me back I really do but like you said with the ice cream she doesn't know what flavor she wants Its hard on me because I have no family they are back in Jersey and I'm in Texas and to top it off with a bang my mom passed away on new years day of  and its gonna be a tough on tonight Ill take your word for it bro but its hard to cope with this problem then she wants to fuck me and tell me how she feels and then next day back with the other dude that she said she loves You cant love some one that damn quick But hey she's kinda fucked in the head I made a mistake that I cant take back I wished the worst on her and came back she has some type of cancer and I feel so bad now I hate being such a nice guy and getting treated like shit why cant girls respect men like us                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
From with u JuliaH7931 Best to explore these issues with a qualified therapist The idea of repressed memories of childhood abuse has been pretty much discredited IIRC The recovered memories in many cases turned out to be fabrications

Personally this was in the early 1900s but idk my history too good It's an anarchist slogan and Magón was part of the anarchist faction from what i understand I don't have any friends or family I could stay with unfortunately Only resources I know of that I haven't tried yet are the clinic with therapists on a sliding scale I mentioned I think they reopen this week so I can see about getting an appointment I don't think I can work cause I can barely take care of myself                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Yes let it roll off you What point is there to fretting and arguing with him about it Either his intentions were good in which case you should take it as intended or his intentions were bad in which case he's not a friend There's no option but to let it pass by without another thought or worry

In dependent on the government for living needs I am unable to work or go to school presently and it's likely to be permanent disability So if there's a giant change to medicare or otherwise I won't be able to afford my medication which is what keeps me from hearing voices and being intensely depressed as often I'm scared of the sounds coming back the psychosis I know it's not real but it's scary and I don't want to be in that place again

This extreme anxiety and dating someone with bipolar and medicated it is going to be difficult and you have to establish an open dialog about emotions feelings The thing about dating people with mental illnesses is it's very important to understand their headspace and reassess where they are at routinely because it changes often To ease the anxiety speak to him when he's stable and calm and discuss what is isn't acceptable behavior and also ask what he needs from you in times of manic depressive episodes Feel free to pm if you wanna talk                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Thanka recommendation is skullcandy headphones ear plugs whichever you prefer great sound and durability imo And if you're looking for a great headset as well I'd suggest HyperX Cloud II Gaming Headset I've had mine for almost two years now The mic sucks in it though but the sound is amazing I'm currently using a secondary headset for the mic since my razer kraken broke and only the mic works I'm using that

Yes mom wanted me to watch FOX with her to wait for the ball to drop I made it about  minutes before seeing all the couples and happy sexy people being interviewed before I had to get the fuck out of there I'm currently locked in my room crying and drinking the night away Happy new years                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Op she sought help Just out of curiosity That could be one way to help with the behaviors of OCD but I understand if that's just not an option Coming from someone with OCD I can't even imagine how annoying I am to people around me when I act out I know that people like my boyfriend and my mom love me but I'm sure they get sick of how I am So know you're probably not alone But also maybe try to be more understanding and give her some leeway It's possible she lashes out because she already feels bad or maybe even shameful about her compulsions and she doesn't know how to communicate that to you I know I lash out against those close to me when I'm having a panic attack or in the middle of a compulsion just because I'm already feeling bad about myself and my OCD and if someone says something negative to me about it it just adds fuel to the fire Also be communicative with her and let her know how you're feeling but also that you're here for her to come to I had to learn how to communicate how I was feeling with my OCD and my mom had to lean when to step back and say ok I don't know what you're going through but I'm here So it's a two way street Good luck

I also the trauma aspect to it which is that my abusive father talked a lot like him and I can easily get PTSD issues just hearing that voice So it's hard for me to feel remotely safe when you have someone who's so close to my abuser in power In this case a pres instead of a cop and dad though I just don't feel safe and haven't felt safe since then and because of the hate crimes I might not be black or otherwise but I'm afraid of what people would do if they knew I was disabled and autistic I want to feel stable and safe again But if this is the wrong place to vent about something I'm deeply terrified of then I'm sorry

At goal really my number one critical goal for  is to walk into a psychiatrist's office and be bluntly honest I have kinda that foreboding feeling that this is my last opportunity to proceed in a non disruptive way I must act or this problem will do it for me in a not so nice way

Wish there is no right or wrong answer when you post on here Imo its just to blow some anger or how you feel Just say what u want no ones going to judge u on this subreddit because everyone feels shitty And if they do there just a troll

She really want to also I listen to a bunch of improv podcasts and they are often the funniest part of my week I actually found this show tonight because I met some people who took classes at the theater and remembered that I meant to check out classes starting in January They are all booked but found the show tonight so at least have something to do Hopefully it's awesome and I can see about taking classes in April But I also think Improv to many of us SAers is like the deep part of the pool We spend so much time censoring planning prepping evaluating that just speaking off the cuff isn't something we have the ability to do Not sure if this will help in that regards or if it'll just reinforce it People here have said it helped them a lot                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Then you

 have about  books in my apartment that I am reading aka put down a few chapters in halfway or somehow stopped reading right before the climax of the book even though I was liking it For me the easiest way to get through a book if I want to and actually pay attention is to read while not at home i e on the train between work and home Bringing the book with me and reading it while out I'm able to focus on it better in short bursts and for some reason I tend not to get distracted and read other books even when it's a book on my Nook and not a physical book I don't know why If it's something boring or something with a vague deadline I like to have special snacks or treats to enjoy while reading that I have specifically set aside to eat only when reading that particular book I don't know if that would be helpful but I thought I would mention it in case

This if you saw yourself drink on video you would gasp I've got an good alcoholic friend and he is universally regarded by a wide range of friends associates and aquaintances as a liability at social gatherings He isn't shunned but he isn't invited to some things because of how he can become You might want to consider the effects you have on other people can really be quite distressing You sound dismissive of your behavior I speak from a place of experience I'm not sure you've accepted the depths of what being an alcoholic can mean for the relationships in your life Food for thought I understand your hurt but it might be temporary Work on yourself and the rest of your life will fall into place If you stop drinking

I think that you're really right that all of our existential crises don't mean that we can't be happy Maybe life's meaningless maybe there's no God maybe nothing is right or wrong maybe all of those things are TRUE But that doesn't mean that we can't be happy and find a way to enjoy the time that we have Of course that can be hard too but I'd like to think it really is possible for us all the same Happy  to you too and thanks for the words of encouragement

Ive the smallest I've been in my adult life is   Even though I worked out dieted would even starve myself I could not drop my size to anything below that Hence why I'm working with my doctor and keeping tabs on potential PCOS Because if that is an issue then there's going to be a world of trouble with dropping the rest of it At least I can build muscle It's possible for women to be forever alone I wish people understood that Just because we look nice doesn't mean we have guys flocking to us I'm kind of frightening apparently and I have social anxiety so not really approached Plus can't seem to find most guys I meet attractive Not asexual but still have this issue Plus y'know mental illness is a thing

Thank you for sharing this I am relatively new and I have been trying to practice meditation too Kabat Zinn style I am not crying during meditation although I agree with everyone one here that it would be okay Also I think Kabat Zinn would say that the most important thing is that you are trying it and being consistent I try to concentrate on my breath and a slogan or just my HP I have a surpluss of emotions right now too so I identify with what you wrote I have many tears I haven't shed but I feel safe enough in meetings that I usually just get a lot of it out then Are you going to meetings The wonderful ladies in my Monday meeting are so accepting of my tears and are so loving about it And through it all they assure me that I will feel better which is so encouraging to me right now Thank you and hugs for your post OP and all who responded to it

I is so TRUE i feel like feminism misses the point they want men and women to be the same but this is impossible men and women both have advantages and disadvantages we have to make the most out of them instead of try and be someone we are not

Yea is actually a big issue with this expansion particularly with the way she was playing it for the gold this expansion has reintroduced the grind to WoW in a way it has never existed before unending Even the very top players in WoW haven't managed to come anywhere close to 'completion' to a point where you can say 'no reason to log on outside of content hours' and they are getting ready to release MORE It is actually killing a lot of the game too because its burning people out so fast the content is fun to an extent but it is life absorbing for any people who plan to try and stay competitive

It you are having a bad time Can you leave each day to go do things Any relatives to visit perhaps she would not mind if your doing family related things Are your local library open Monday Perhaps you could get your brother to go with and get her to chill out on him not studying Does he at least have someplace warm to stay tonight                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
You be careful about making those sorts of claims but even with the occasional plateaus depressing days I love life far more when I'm concentrating and succeeding at nofap than when I'm not

I'm congrats on a year I'm not sure of any bucket list things I'll knock out in  but I'm pretty psyched to spend it sober                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
My said this before but because you went a month that means you can and will do it again The key to restraint for you seems to be not getting too close to the mirror I think even when we with compulsive skin picking disorder leave our skin alone and get it clear or at least don't make things worse by messing with it we are still obsessed with our skin Then if we don't pick we focus obsessively on the perfect makeup the perfect skincare So we are still obsessed with our skin but for me from my personal experience the focus on skin care and makeup leads me back to the mirror which leads to disaster and lapses for me Because that cycle happened to me repeatedly I began to think back to the time in my life when I never looked in the mirror when I was a child So I thought nothing else has worked I'll do what I did as a child just really not bother with it or even think about it Wash it without looking at it Lotion cream if skin is dry put on with cotton ball or washcloth A good coverage powder from a distance lipstick arrange hair all from a foot or more from a mirror Done Free from thinking about my skin Don't know if this helps to know but it works for me Besides I got so damn tired of thinking of touching constantly fixing my skin and making it worse and worse myself I figured if I totally ignored my skin it would probably look a thousand times better than when I was focusing obsessively on my skin and perfecting make that ruining it It certainly couldn't look any worse than I was making it and plus I would gain back the hours of my life I sacrificed to picking It turned out to be the right choice for me

Hi had a young man share at a my home group this week It was like the words hurt him as he said things out loud that he'd never said to anyone before It took not only me but a bunch of us right back to early days of sobriety A powerful reminder of how far I have come in recovery I go to meetings to remember I work with newcomers and service Service has kept me sober in times when meetings alone might not have been enough                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
I she was completely well she would not need further IV antibiotics Her temperature is likely to show fever until she is fully treated It would be worrisome if you see the temp up trending a general curve of increasing temps over  or more hours There certainly is room for device measurement variance accounting for the difference too If you measure a fever of  or better or she starts vomiting and or says she's feeling worse then she probably needs to be see                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Why know I don't think he took it personally He was just giving his input about differing mindsets If you have the mindset I'll quit tomorrow you probably won't quit I understand your intention but you must let people be people Coaches are usually the most hard ass people in the room They're that way for a reason

Depends chillin with the dog on the couch drinking lime a ritas Really sucks that I have no friends Trying hard not to get down about it Social media doesn't help that's for sure                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
I think you have a lot of valid concerns I do just want to dig a little deeper into this whole unmiserable thing You are dealing with someone who has challenges communicating Word choice is not her strong suit If you are going to continue in this relationship you two will need to be passionate about figuring out what each other wants needs and means Ask her more about what unmiserable is actually describing I can see that as something very deep and meaningful if you could get the whole picture out of her On the flip side a person can't keep another from their sadness indefinitely If a tendency towards depression is at the root of this it really should be treated before you bring children into the mix Dynamics will change in a relationship as life changes It could work if you're cognizant of what you are getting in to Your girlfriend will likely continue to use language that disturbs you The key is to withold reacting until you really get to the root of what she means Again staying in this relationship will require a long term commitment to discovering a common language I'm convinced that it could be exciting and fun but only if both partners see it that way Last thing as the parent of an asd child it's nothing to be afraid of if you have a big heart and a strong spirit There will surely be great challenges but honestly the hardest part by far was before we got a diagnosis Early intervention is key These kids need a ton of attention that other kids do fine without Know when to ask for help Parenting a child on the spectrum can be hugely rewarding I'm convinced that the world needs a whole lot more of what my son has to offer His unique perspective is amazing to be around and being his mother has already been an incredible adventur and he's only

Im I agree He'd not be better off beating off People get over their addictions in their own ways Like when someone is addicted to hardcore drugs sometimes even in rehab they won't make them go cold turkey They'll ween them off of it slowly People do nofap the way they want to do nofap People actually do stick to their resolutions Is it the right way to go about nofap No But telling him he's better off fapping is definitely not the right way

Count mom said it didn't do much for her either honestly Might be because I'm borderline underweight that I'm getting anything out of it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
Yes went out a few weeks ago like that and it's nice to do every now and again to air myself out but people get silly when they drink and it kinda bores me i went out through meetup com and a few people definitely made the comment that i wasn't drinking on a pub crawl of all things oh well not that i care i am sober and that's all there is to it i have replaced a lot of that emptiness with running maybe i will get back into climbing as a scene i dunno but the bar club scene is getting kinda old now any sort of social activity is kinda lubricated with alcohol art shows food truck festivals festivals in general it's just silly really drinking is silly and i would rather not be doing such silly things

Hello really happy that you posted that thank you You have perfectly described what I've been feeling myself I'm sure we all share the same fear of not feeling comfortable with ourselves I don't get to use booze to mask how I'm feeling and that goes for the gloomy feelings as well as the good stuff I agree with you but the way I think of it is we are choosing to live life without self medicating We are choosing the hard way Every morning we wake up and look in the mirror we must remind ourselves that we are making ourselves stronger everyday The best thing I can do for myself is to exercise and eat well Do it long enough and you feel unstoppable Overtime you will feel better and better and feel comfortable exploring new things in life As for me I'm still working on feeling comfortable I turned down a NYE party because of disabling anxiety and worry But hey gym in the morning and no work on Monday So I'll be sure to find something fun to do

NDV still feel like my friends don't want to be around me It's multiple different groups too And when I think about it I get really upset because deep down I can't help but blame myself for the isolating I kind of decided recently that I would just work on myself and not be sad about the fact that they are all still friends and they all make plans and have trips and dinners and party's and game nights and no one even texts me to ask how I'm doing I always text first which is fine but if I try to talk about getting lunch or make plans they say ok and as it gets close they end up blowing me off Hurts and I realize I'm not doing something right Then I'm upset bc I might make someone else feel this way and then I just want to be alone Or hang out with my mom which I don't really think is totally normal for someone my age Even my friends who have close families they all have really large groups of friends

There's all I can ever manufacture to say is something very generic the beer is nice it's so loud in here how's your night going  etc That's actually perfectly fine I say stuff like that and people say stuff like that all the time as well The problem is you think it's a problem and get self conscious about it The way out of this is to realize that if you do indeed say something stupid or others think you're too boring or whatever you have to own it If you are comfortable with it then what others think won't bother you That will help you overcome your worry and self consciousness Ironically you'll then speak alot more effortlessly and come across as less socially awkward So the saying it's all in your head is actually TRUE

I did the exact same thing twice a few months ago And I'm glad now that I didn't go through with it

 am not however this doesn't change for me If anything I feel TOO much for people and it means I don't uphold boundaries or stand up for myself when I should Because I don't want to hurt them The only time I have no empathy for people because I feel their emotions TOO much and it hurts me TOO much and I deal by lashing out and or dissociating more dissociation now that I am better and I become numb It was a breakthrough for myself when I gave myself permission to tone down my affective empathy feeling their emotions when i have too If I tone down my affective empathy it allows me to keep my cognitive empathy understanding what they're thinking what will be good for them etc and keeps me able to help others but also stops me from dissociating and becoming overwhelmed and also take into account my feelings and boundaries For example if i am having a bad time and a friend is suicidal in the past I might have told them to shut up if i was overwhelmed or continue to help them even though they were triggering me and then be a mess afterwards Now I will do something like saying Hey  I really feel for you  it must be hard  I am not in a good place either  so i am not sure if I can help you  and i want the best for both of us I know x is a good friend and you can reach out to them  have you tried your coping mechanisms  please talk to someone  even if you have to ring the ambulance  hope everything works out and you're in my thoughts  If you don't message me tomorrow  i will message to check in on you  love you  sorry i can't help xx

My miss being drunk but nothing else that goes along with it Focusing on the absence of the negative instead of the absence of the positive fun while being drunk has helped me immensely Then time passes and it's crazy how much better I feel in general Oddly enough ingesting a depressant in large quantities daily makes you depressed I feel much better I'd give it some time hopefully you will too

Been don't know much about it I have never had therapy so I have nothing to judge by I think that you should be allowed to try different therapists until you find one that suits you Just my opinion I can see where it would take some time to get to know each other a bit but they are there to help you not make you a chronic patient Can you talk to someone about it Your regular doctor or something                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
I should tell them that you are an adult who can make their own decisions and you are hurt they they are not there to support you If they continue this type of behavior I would say to spend less and less time around them

 always get my hopes up that things will be better But then quickly come back down to reality                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Happy used so called legal CBD before If you don't live in a state where cananbis is legal then the CBD products available to you are derived from industrial hemp for the most part Most of that is imported from China and is complete garbage Having said that I have used CBD oil drops and it did have a positive effect without making me too drowsy However after about a year it stopped working I don't know if I developed a tolerance or if what I was using turned to crap imported from china If you live in a legal state then get to a dispensary and try some of the good stuff Forget about the headshop crap For more information visit r cbd A useful alternate to CBD is Kava It works on the GABA receptors much like alcohol and xanax but without most of the negative side effects I can take it in the morning and still have a productive day Buy ground kava powder only the extracts and pills should be avoided as you don't know what kind of kava was used to make them Kava generally comes in three forms ground root powder micronized powder more finely ground and prepared root and instant Kava is normally prepared as a drink but it is very nasty tasting and can numb your mouth You can fill gelcpas with instant and micronized kava as an alternative I have been using Kava for a couple of years now and this shit works as effective as CBD if not more so It's not strong enough to stop a full panic attack once it comes on but it works rather well as a daily preventative To try it out I recommend the instant sample pack for Gourmet Hawaiian Kava Visit r kava for vendor info and recommendations                                                                                                                                                  
I body responds differently too I've never been much of a drinker and only ever really had a couple of social drinks It was never something I particularly liked or enjoyed so didn't actively seek it I used to prefer vodka because it was easy to disguise but always had a few side effects even from just a couple of light drinks Later on I realised that I had an intolerance to potatoes so I was giving myself a double dose I also have something of a histamine intolerance now so my body cant handle it anymore What you might be feeling could be something like that As much as it has a socially acceptable image it isn't what you would call healthy and we are all built differently

Any this has been my life Constantly avoiding escaping procrastinating taking breaks that never end I know that ADD and depression are part of the problem for me and I control as well as possible with medications But the absolute best approach I've found is to deal with escapism as an addiction that is a behavior I have no control over without spiritual help through the  Step program pioneered by Alcoholics Anonymous The group I belong to is Escapism and Fantasy Addicts Anonymous I have let go of reading web surfing all entertainment media especially scifi popular science fanfiction I realized that when I turn on a television or pick up a book or magazine or pause to daydream about my favorite fictional characters something happens in my brain that is not normal Other people can read a chapter then put the book down and go on with their day I CANNOT put the book down Same with other media self distractions of all kinds even crossword puzzles I've been progressively more 'sober' from escapism for  years now I feel awake for the first time in my life Don't get me wrong I am still ADD I still lose track of time prioritize poorly and I'm impulsive instead of systematic BUT I no longer lose huge chunks of time to these escapes or feel the shame and despair of surfacing to find that once again I have sabotaged myself and hurt people around me I have  school age kids My life in sobriety from escapism hasn't been success after success but it feels phenomenal to know I've at least showed up and done the best I could

Do just cleaned the bathroom and am currently cleaning the clothes I am worried being that close to the virus At one point my gloves snapped and sprayed some water on my clothes I'm worried during cleaning something got in my mouth somehow My wife was sick more than  hours ago and I haven't got it yet so I thought I might be safe But I feel like now I have to reset the clock

I shooting yourself in the foot saying  isn't going to be good when not even the whole world is on Jan  yet You say you'll be disappointed with all that you won't accomplish then go on to say you're just going to do nothing and waste time How can you be disappointed when you give absolutely zero effort Disappointment is reserved for actual let downs not things that don't miraculously go well Yes you can't just push your depression aside and kick ass like no one's business but you have to try something Depression wants you to do nothing because that's what it feeds on and the longer you sit and sulk the worse it'll get You need to reveal your worth to yourself You have potential don't waste it telling yourself it's not enough People will tell you time and time again that you're worth it but it's not this depressed version that has worth The person you could be if you set every fiber of your being on 'Go' is worth it You can do great things but you need to see that you're capable I hope the first part of my message didn't put you off I know what's it like to be depressed beyond belief but imo the worst thing I or anyone could do is feel sorry for you                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Knew still dealing with it The key for my successes thus far is acceptance and thought segregation I first had to accept that these thoughts are a part of me just thankfully not the TRUE me I am truly not attracted to children but I have to accept that thoughts about it is a part of me That acceptance is the key to conditioning your brain to have have the fear reaction That's the basis of ERP therapy Those first couple hours days weeks of the acceptance are so hard It feels so wrong and counter intuitive which in reality shows you are not what you fear you are Then the segregation part I identify my OCD thoughts as Scumbag Brain It allows me to sort of disassociate from the OCD thoughts and keep them separate from my conscious real thoughts Aside from that I am also on a low dose of Cymbalta for my OCD and Vyvanse for my ADHD My understanding is that Cymbalta doesn't really help with the thoughts themselves until high doses but it helps me deal with them due to less depression and more balanced brain chemistry

Ugh all I started recognizing my symptoms after a friend of mine with many similar experiences to me was diagnosed as BPD I decided to read up on it and bawled like a baby the further I got into it everything every site and article said was VERY familiar I was already being treated for depression anxiety and OCD so at my next Dr's appointment I asked about the possibility of having BPD My doctor has never given me an official diagnosis she never did for the depression anxiety OCD and said that she wouldn't diagnose me before my mid 20s because I was still growing and things can change so quickly in your youth that she didn't want to pigeon hole me

Yup do sound similar to my husband He and I are both attending individual therapy and are in the process of finding someone to talk to as a couple Since he works from home my husband typically has to exert himself for social interaction He finds it stressful to leave the house and doesn't often enjoy going out with friends instead preferring to stay in and pursue his special interests Prior to this diagnosis I was concerned he was becoming agoraphobic I now better understand his feelings and am trying to figure out how to maintain a healthy balance by encouraging him to expand beyond his comfort zone without pushing him too far or too fast It's a hard balance to maintain

It's is my wonder drug I thought I'd try something else in September long story so my doctor prescribed Trintellex Didn't work So then we switched to Effexor XR and that didn't help So I asked to go back on my Lexapro Within a week I am feeling better I am eating at least one sometimes two decent meals a day again  I totally related to what you wrote about how food is repugnant right now My sleep isn't completely back I wake up with high anxiety so my doctor has prescribed Klonopin to help with that until the Lexapro kicks in more Klonopin is slower to act but it lasts in the system a bit longer I take the Klonopin before bed so it gets me through the night and the first part of the day and then I usually relax as I start my routine I take Lexapro in the AM Hugs

Man different for each person I've gotten clean cold turkey with suboxxone and now I'm on methadone CT wasn't as bad the first time bc I was still smoking H and hadn't started shooting an astronomical amount but when I tried it the second time I relapsed I could personally tell it wouldn't work for me Then I tried subs and got clean again I only took them for a month so I weaned down quickly and stayed sober for a bit The last time I relapsed I tried subs again and they made me feel weird like my mind and body weren't connected It took forever to process thoughts and put together sentences and I always felt a little sick no matter how much I upped the dose so I went to methadone I personally like methadone bc I have a free counselor I can talk to it's inexpensive plus they have a free program for people who can't afford it and it gives you a sense of routine and discipline She's probably going to have to do trial and error but I would have a couple subs handy if possible but try cold turkey first That way if it gets to be too much she can see how she likes the subs

 my good streaks I also never had more luck but I got more looks from women Which was better then being practically non existent But what really matters is that you feel better about your self Thats what really matters with or without women your life will be better regardless But im sure it will come in time if you stay on track

Hey mate I won't pretend to know exactly how you feel but I was suicidal  months ago and now am glad I didn't do it I now know that it would really effect my brother nephew and mother I've said for years that I'd do it some day but now am glad I didn't                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Good I wrote in response to a different post tonight Lexapro is my wonder drug I thought I'd try something else in September long story so my doctor prescribed Trintellex Didn't work So then we switched to Effexor XR and that didn't help So I asked to go back on my Lexapro Within a week I am feeling better I am eating at least one sometimes two decent meals a day again My sleep isn't completely back I wake up with high anxiety so my doctor has prescribed Klonopin to help with that until the Lexapro kicks in more Klonopin is slower to act but it lasts in the system a bit longer I take the Klonopin before bed so it gets me through the night and the first part of the day and then I usually relax as I start my routine I take Lexapro in the AM When I am properly dosed and taking my Lexapro it cuts it by  I hardly feel any anxiety

Yeah going through a similar thing I recently realized I tend to be too pushy persistent and sometimes aggressive when pursuing friends or romance Honestly no one is perfect at communicating We're all just pushing our sausage fingers into a glowy thing in the hope that someone else is listening There are other people that have posted actual tips on this thread I am not one of them

I you so freaking much I'm going to attend but I've been to a couple parties and bars and turned down every drink It's amazing how much that badge really makes a difference and helps keep me accountable I'll probably be that awkward guy in the corner But I hurt way too much right now to stay home alone with my thoughts I really hate myself for letting someone else determine my self worth Thank you for caring

 wow you must have been lucky with your travels last time i went anywhere my friends had gotten immodium and prescription versions that were stronger just in case                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
It'll not saying you're doing this but just see if the following rings TRUE If your understanding of exercise currently only encompasses certain kinds of activities or certain intensities especially grueling workouts you might think all exercise feels really bad A lot of new exercisers jump in with good expectations but end up doing too much too soon and it hurts It's sweaty and uncomfortable and then you're sore the next day Why does anyone like feeling like that Because if you stick with it and or if you alter your definition of exercise to include lower intensity activities https www researchgate net publication  The Pleasure and Displeasure People Feel When they Exercise at Different Intensities Decennial Update and Progress towards a Tripartite Rationale for Exercise Intensity Prescription it starts feeling good for almost everyone Maybe not during the time you're exercising but that's okay Exercise in different forms is a pleasure for some people and a chore for others But I firmly believe that exercise is a necessary component of good mental and physical health It saddens me that a lot of people don't exercise because they think exercise only means one thing and they don't like that one thing usually that thing is the gym I always tell my patients to pick a lower intensity activity if they are having trouble with exercise adherence If running means pain and sweat and breathlessness to you why not try walking instead If lifting weights is not your cup of tea could you commit to home bodyweight exercises Or home yoga videos Do you enjoy a hobby that you might not have previously considered to be exercise like gardening The light exercise you will do is always better than the vigorous exercise you won't I would really encourage you to try making a habit of any kind of daily activity that seems doable to you It can sound daunting but it doesn't have to be

Agreed is actually worse then a regular fap Source http www yourbrainonporn com what if i use porn without orgasm Don't edge I know this comment is  hours too late but edging is only cheating yourself I think you knew it counted as a relasp before you even began it wasn't about the clock it was about your desire to feel numb from the pain of the world just for a moment the world doesn't have to be painful and although it may seem like it is it won't be I doubt this'll get seen but I hope you at least glance over it

Damn Ancedotal and not a doctor I think I had the exact same thing It started off on my hands like that and then spread all over my trunk It was super itchy and ended up taking Prednisone which didn't do much and it ended up going away a week later had for about two weeks I attributed it as an allergic reaction caused by the dye red

Is always especially when asking a cardiac question demographics are helpful A few things are not suggestive of cardiac problems like normal ability to exercise and the fact you can reproduce the symptoms by position sitting There are possible electrical abnormalities arrhythmias that could produce these symptoms you can evaluate this simply by checking your pulse when this is happening It would have to be  bpm or higher or  or lower to produce symptoms If I were a guessing man it sounds suspicious for GERD You might try ranitidine 150mg twice daily for  days to see if it improves                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
When a speech called everybody's free to wear sunscreen it helped me alot when I was younger In particular one line don't feel guilty if you don't know what you want to do with your life  Some of the most interesting people I know didn't know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives  some of the MOST interesting 40 year Olds I know still dont   It sounds like you do care about people You care about hurting them and what they think of you you suffer for them It sounds like you care Just trust me nobody is good at anything or really has fun hobbies at  Everyone goes around thinking about how everyone must have things figured out when really nobody does We all don't exist for a reason but instead because we can Things can change

I absolutely do respond to physical appearance To a depressing degree There is actual research on this As a woman it's striking how differently better people treat me when I do the full makeup skirt jewelry etc thing and better fit the mold of what our society considers attractive So of course I do that when I want that advantage BUT it makes me respect those people less for being such superficial dumbasses Sometimes I wonder how different my life would be if I worked harder to be hot or whatever I'd have more people in my life but probably not quality people

I problem a bad relationship can cause you is NOT just emotional but financial and legal Many divorced men become destitute or homeless when divorce court imposes impossible alimony and child support Some men are falsely accused of rape and spend years in prison It can be much much worse than being alone That was the reason I chose FA decades ago

I you ask your doctor to repeat the test Research the sensitivity test's ability to correctly identify people taking their medication and cite this to support your argument For example a test with  sensitivity will correctly identify   people truly taking their meds The other  are FALSE negatives A test with lower sensitivity e g  has a higher chance of FALSE negatives Also see if you can learn the med concentration level that determines a positive test and the dose of medication that it typically corresponds with since everyone excretes at different rates This may be important since you're on a low moderate dose I would try to be objective in presenting any data you can locate along with information obtained from the pharmacist Try not to be emotional or else they may perceive you as drug seeking If they'll let you repeat the test make sure you take your med a few hours beforehand Hydrate well without overdoing it and avoid acidic foods I hope you're able to sort this out and I'm sorry this is happening to you

Yeah once heard a story of a dude that was being harassed and cyber stalked by some people they were talking mad mad shit online and invading his privacy so then he started to check out their social media profiles and then they started to file order of protections against him Some of the funniest shit I have ever heard Every voyeur is disgusting in the eyes of the public until the pubic are the voyeurs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
I have a question hopefully a fellow psychologist can help me with A few years back my father went to a psychologist and the psychologist asked If he had ever started fires when he was younger If he counted ceiling tiles If he could spell certain words backwards The answer to these questions were yes except for the last one does anyone have an idea of what the psychologist was trying to diagnose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
If my case the easiest thing was to try to walk across half the country to try to sneak in and get to my clothes and bike and musical instruments so I could sell them and get a nest egg to start flipping stuff from DHGate and Alibaba onto amazon and ebay I knew I was unemployable and that money doesn't last forever if you don't have a way to make it grow But the flaw with any plan is the person executing it It was hard traveling and I would get bogged down in libraries doing market research which was mostly looking at the textures of zoomed in high res pictures of manufactured goods and measuring my backpack to see if there was room in there Sometimes I was with it enough to send a bizarre email to some confused and impatient chinese factory owner I still have them all And of course adding and multiplying the same numbers over and over again in my head to make sure how long I could last if things moved slow before I couldn't afford the PO box and eventual storage unit I was planning to need You might notice there's no food or shelter at all in that equation Like intellectually I knew it was about food and survival but I just wasn't making the connection all I knew was I needed money You wouldn't believe the subterfuge and betrayal that happened when I phoned home for the holidays but honestly I don't know whose face scared me more my own in the mirror or my moms when she looked at me I think we both knew it was her last shot and she needed this more than me so I gave in Her brother would always move on to the next town whenever the family got too close so she knew the stakes

Awww was underweight when I took it The psychiatrist I saw at the time said that it would either help or do nothing pretty low risk medication so I'm glad it's working for someone                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
I there something your doctor can prescribe to help out with that I understand what you shared though I get so discouraged when I can't sleep through the night I try not to worry about how it will affect my day later on  but I do My doctor prescribed klonopin taken at night to relax me enough to keep me asleep and keep my anxiety lower in the morning when it tends to be its highest Klonopin is longer acting than Xanax or Ativan Once my Lexapro becomes fully functional I shouldn't need the klonopin

 really dislike it when people say that being a relationship won't change anything I'm sorry you had difficulties while being in a relationship but saying that your experience is proof that it doesn't work for anyone else is just plain wrong What doesn't work for you might work out for someone else Be more understanding to the people who are suffering from depression it's not the same for everyone

Thank I don't have anything against SHP and I think it is rather good but equally it would be good to try get some less severe cuts on there more often so newcomers don't get so desensitised and we are all reminded that what we do is pretty bad by most people's standards Its a great sub but really only shows the severest of severe and I think we all forget that a lot of the time Even in the  weeks or so that I have been on there the cuts have been getting worse and worse

 relate on a lot of these issues from wanting more than drinking buddy relationships to the post drinking status check Unfortunately a few nights ago there were some drunken texts harmless but embarrassing I spent the next day in an anxious haze and have found that when I drink lately crippling anxiety goes along with my hangovers Not because of anything that happened although that makes it worse but because the booze takes such a toll on my body Anyway congrats on recognizing that you'd like things to change we deserve it From what I can see here in SD there are a lot of people that can relate it's nice to feel a little less alone

Fun too Even when I do feel intense urges to end it I still have this thought saying what if Maybe if I hold out then things will somehow get better one day                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Okay am assuming you have some hobby relaxing activity that can at least even out some of the tension right Having an outlet is important                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
FUCK I remember correctly the first happened on a Monday evening and the second a Tuesday morning It was a long time ago and I don't remember what I was doing over those weekends but I did drink most weekends back then I vaguely recall discussing drinking with the neurologist What I do remember from that time is that I would drink a lot and see all my friends doing the same so my behavior seemed pretty normal As I said in my original post I don't think I actually had a grasp of what normal was back then

You a junior and has been considering home school before any of this happened I'll discuss this with her as well Thank you so much for reaching out                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
This husband and I are  He recently was diagnosed by his psychologist and psychiatrist well a year ago and last week had a full neuro psych eval We get the report on Friday So we are very similar and with a year under my belt my husband encouraged me to comment as he says I'm doing a good job of supporting him From my perspective everything changed for me I went through a grieving period where I realized that some things I wanted from my husband that I thought were maybe related to his anxiety and depression I would never get Particularly the idea of family memories traditions etc then I went through a phase where we didn't talk about anything BUT the spectrum We basically went over our whole relationship and everything made SO MUCH more sense It was very therapeutic to do that together We have been together for  years so we have gone through college 20s etc together Then we really were able to learn how to talk to each other Therapy had helped us in the past already but honestly it was the best thing to happen It was the best thing for ME because I stopped having unrealistic expectations And he is still the man I fell in love with and love more every day This made things so much clearer to me So what actual things have I done I used to get upset that I would have to handle phone calls for things like bills or insurance or doctor appts I don't mind anymore It's hard for him and stressful When we have family gatherings I don't get upset when he wants to hang out on the stairs and observe I don't think he's being rude or an asshole At home I used to get mad that he didn't clean more that he really didn't get why I was upset about things What I felt was rude and condescending was just specific and clear for him Left no questions about what I wanted Like can you sweep and vacuum and do dishes today instead of can you clean up while I'm at work We have five children all of them adopted through foster care Needless to say there is a lot of stress in our lives but he is an amazing dad and stays at home right now His biggest stressor is work he's been looking for a job for a few months now There's so much if you want to PM please feel free

porn fantastic to hear I think Lexapro and Citalopram are pretty similar But it's so good to hear that you've had bad reactions and still found something that works for you And sleeping and eating I'll ask about Klonopin I'm about to make a smoothie and see if drinking instead of eating helps but so far today I've eaten half a poptart and some apple sauce Ugh                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Male is the best response I've read Thanks you Last night I drove myself to the ER just in case and sat outside for  hours till I calmed Down I took a Xanax My symptoms were physically unbearable I couldn't sit straight at all Chest arms and legs felt tight I'm not sure whether to do go to the ER just to be safe rather than be sorry It was probably the most physically uncomfortable I've ever felt in my life A few other people just think it's my anxiety but I much believe it's more physical than mental Never had physical symptoms like that before and I have a pretty strenuous physical workout

 and downs tonight but the downs are good Lots of introspection and gratitude Staying in tonight I could probably pull off a sober hour or two out somewhere but I've done the NYE parties done the good time friends done the hangovers and regrets and reruns of the same I don't know where I go from here or even who I am sometimes because I've spent a great deal of the last  years numbing myself most nights wishing the previous  years had turned out differently What a waste of time it has been So grateful to be here now sober and awake

Lol something people talk about I'd propose a slightly different explanation though It's less that there is a physiological change occurring and more that you are actually more comfortable capable of looking yourself in the eyes in the first place As well as looking other people in the eyes It's something that is standing out to you because it's something you weren't comfortable doing before when in the back of your mind you had been dragging around some shame or resentment or other anxieties

The seems that you think that something is wrong with spending your time alone Why is that Why would spending time with yourself be worse than being all alone in a loud obnoxious environment If anything I think it's sad that someone would have to DEPEND on other people for their own entertainment It means you can't even enjoy yourself And also tell me what are you getting from the night apart from bleeding eardrums and horrible alcoholic breath

Same agree completely Feminism will eventually get washed out it seems Any mentality that hurts or slows the reproductive rate will get washed away by the mentality that doesn't The women who focus on their careers will have less babies than the ones who don't After a certain amount of time women who continued to invest themselves into their families will grow and live on along with their mentalities It's amazing when you think about the world and how things may sway to the right or to the left but eventually it always returns to this state of stability The truest mentalities and philosophies are the ones which live on because they are the only ones capable of standing the ultimate test time itself Things work out eventually I suppose

Linkin be honest dude in early sobriety you might get left out of a lot of things I flip flop between sober and not sober a bit because I constantly fuck up But I've found it nice to have two circles of friends It's hard at first but it helps me My friends wanna go party and I wanna do something too I'll hit up my sober pal and we'll watch movies and knit like some motherfuckers Or I'll hit up someone I've been talking to and see if they want to go on a date Or just see what my friends I know aren't drinking are up to It sucks having two separate circles but I can't really let my old buddies go even if they still like to get fucked up I love em and all that jazz And I know they're worried about me and sometimes don't want to invite me to some of the more hard throw downs And I'm coming to really like my sober pals a lot too Almost as much as I used to like partying and that is saying something I dunno man maybe try something like I did

I not an issue because everybody is consenting everybody is safe and everybody knows what they're doing Assuming that they're doing it properly of course I would never in a million years lay a finger on my boyfriend but I sometimes have days where I'm a switch and I'm feeling dominant For me it's a very maternal feeling and the punishment feels playful for the both of us On the flip side it's the exact same case and quit saying can't function move as if that's some catch all term for disgustingly messed up abusive acts I don't know if you're intentionally generalizing but there's a huge huge difference between abuse taking it too far and being unable to function because your ass is too sore or because you've had a particularly intense session that'll take a day or two to recuperate from Also very seldom does masochism have anything to do with straight up beating it's often whipping smacking pinching pulling and awkward positions that are being slowly worked up towards A dom doesn't just drag his sub by the hair into their bedroom beat the living daylights out of her and then fuck her A good dom knows how to do the BDSMM equivalent of foreplay and will bend over backwards to make sure that their sub is okay I get that you're focusing less on BDSM and more on fetishes as a whole but that's still pretty off So what if a fetish or kink will occasionally affect you outside of hot n' heavy times It's not like normal sex can't do that It's pretty standard for people to leave sex glowing unable to sit down or generally hot and bothered I don't see the issue I guess

Nice once you start liking someone you find more reasons to like them and you are less likely to see flaws as well

What find storms to be comforting myself When everyone else is in a state of panic I find myself enjoying the natural chaos of particularly bad weather Storms don't sneak up on you they're just going about their business and not really paying attention to you That's how I feel about them

My too Not at this exact moment but yesterday a few days before that every day for two weeks awhile ago It comes and goes I just told someone they had their whole life ahead of them to make what they wanted of it And I realized that's still TRUE for me too It doesn't matter if you're    or  You still have the rest of your life Everyone's situation is different But your life is yours If you're not satisfied with the results of your decisions try making a different one than normal tomorrow See how it goes I've made some different ones Some help some don't Pay attention Keep what works

 I started abstaining because I noticed my porn habits were becoming bad news I looked at porn every day sometimes multiple times a day I could only masturbate if I looked at porn The porn I was looking at became increasingly intense and weird over time and it got to a point where I basically couldn't remember a time in my life clearly when that wasn't my habit I've found NoFap to be a useful challenge by tying it together it's made it easier for me to abstain Benefits are varied Some pronounced some less so Hard to say what amount is placebo what amount is from abstaining from masturbation and what amount is from abstaining from porn Also hard to say what amount are from covalent factors like healthier habits I've picked up along the way I can say that most of the positive stuff people report here has happened for me as well to some degree or another But I think one of the most simple and succinct benefits has just been the simple discipline of setting a challenge and working towards it Even if there were no concrete benefits to abstaining from PMO specifically that process is worthwhile and can convey benefits of its own Which is another way of saying it has gotten me to think about the choices I make and the habits I have and consider how I can't make choices more conducive to who I want to be and what I want to do while improving my ability to identify choices I make that aren't doing that Personally I think porn is the bigger issue than masturbation overall To which not everyone necessarily has the same problem with it For someone who does have a problem with it though the NoFap template is a pretty solid way of approaching it I think As for sex it makes it better for you but whether or not that is better for your partner is between the two of you

Going live with my parents so I'm not completely alone tonight But I wish I were I hate having to explain to them all the time why I don't go out and stay at home in my room I  understand what you mean about feeling like an outsider No one seems to remember me when plans are made Or maybe they purposefully exclude me I don't know but it is hurtful Nobody ever texts me first and if I don't message them we don't talk Literally no one has texted or called me in over a week I crave TRUE friendship and relationships and feel like I have a lot to offer but no one will give me a chance I daydream all the time of what it is like to have best friends and a boyfriend and to actually have fun experiencing life with them Obviously this takes a toll on my self esteem It makes me feel inferior in many different aspects of my life work school etc I don't even see myself as lovable anymore I hear all these people say to give up and get used to being alone but I don't want to do that I won't make it the rest of my life this way I am only  If things don't change I don't know how I will cope I am sorry to go on this long rant but it has really been weighing on me too lately I hope we both can find some answers and make some changes in  Hope you have a happy new year

 empathy means so much So often in groups treatment centers etc the other patients are younger or so much newer to the system and I feel guilty a bitter jaded cynical damaged piece of goods When I'm supposed to be feeling like the world is full of possiblity y'know we're in our LATE TWENTIES man I'm there in CVS waiting in line for my prescription potassium Augmenting the pain to so many people I am a writer artist Spanish teacher sister If they only knew that I spent  of my life either in the grips of or treating reporting to my team traveling to treatment etc the disease You know                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Fuck sad because i know i have the potentional to do stuff I just never go at the start signal My mind know that i can go just move and shit will get done But it just won't happen time and time again that has happened I sit idly as opportunities pass by me as i wish i could have done that while im seeing the chance to kickstart something new slip me by This thought might be arrogant or simply disrespectful towards other hardworking people But I know because i have watched it many times and i know that it's inevitably going to happen again Im not trying to brag of my superior intellect and such but i do think i am generally smart or rather just have an easy time learning things I just feel my motivation draining and nothing gets done The only productive things that happen is the things i have to do to keep my status as a functional member of society This is just some incoherent rambling but i hope i have conveyed my message in some meaningful way And no you did not put me off with any of this im always open for new perspectives or i hope i am I know this is a sad attempt to make people feel sorry for me and im not requiring anything from anybody Just wanted to vent a bit in a disgraceful manner

Balls man I unfortunately didn't find NoFap until now that I'm  I'd started with that terrible habit by looking occasionally on the family PC as a  year old But it got really bad when I got my first cell phone with internet at the age of  Ever since that shit's eaten away at my life But I'm like  days or so in and it's the best decision I've made in terms of self improvement along with working out and self improvement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Policies your post honestly reminded me a lot of some of my own experiences My doctors have said it's pretty classic for the earlier parts of schizophrenia Let your docs know that you're experiencing all this and see if you're willing to tinker around with your medication until you find something that works You can learn to cope with them and to train your reactions to those things through therapy and the likes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Thank can't be worse either No matters how bad it gets at least you have someone who smiles to you everyday We the single lonely people don't have that

I disagree with you If only people with triple digit streak post here then people like me that try but not being able to get past  week or 10days feel like this place is not for us but only for those that have already overcome their addictions This sub according to me is mainly for people looking for support to end their PMO misery Its not that if I dont have a  streak I cant give a motivating message to other people                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Please would like to argue that feeling alone but not being supported by loved ones is caused by not being supported by yourself and supporting yourself by joining a crowd of supportive people aka getting back in there the work doesn't get rid of the feeling of heartbreak especially if it's solitary work I had this feeling during a nightshift and it felt like implosion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
I does but it won't matter to you either way I would rather try to persuade you to keep trying Sometimes good stuff shows up after the bad                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 you very much I have been thinking of trying Ritalin instead of the Dexedrine Vyvanse which my Doctor prefers

While I'm on meds I definitely have to limit my intake from a few drinks at one time to just one or two because I would feel the impact much faster As far as using it to self medicate I've gotten into that cycle for dealing with the negative symptoms but it doesn't do anything for my positives

For you can't argue with him without getting hit your father is an abuser You literally can't stand up for yourself as an adult without getting beaten That's pure wrong I'm not saying you're a saint but your father is out of control He may be honorable  but he's damaged and is doing his best to pass the damage on as abused people and he was one usually do He probably convinced himself he's being a man '  But it is wrong for him to hit you simply for disagreeing   There is no excuse   It is wrong   Frankly I don't have good advice    You can keep taking it  you can avoid him  stay away as much as possible  you can tell your teachers  who are bound by law to tell the cops and then who knows what will happen   But I don't know  maybe a foster home is better than this shit

Good man I'm  years old and only graduated high school in  when I was  I freaking hated reading all my life because I was forced to read in school But now it's absolutely one of my favorite past times I'd much rather spend money buying books than video games now You can't get rid of a habit without replacing it with another habit Make it a good habit you replace it with like working out reading etc Things that relieve stress for you in a healthy productive manner                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
I think it helps but it doesn't It doesn't help when I can't even take care of myself let alone someone else

Do feel similarly to you I am probably in better conditions though My recommendation to you would be to start small I started with simple goals day by day to achieve Last few weeks the goals has been to do four things immediately after waking up I mean literally as soon as I am aware I am awake I do this See the sun Make the bed Shower Have breakfast I do this within an hour It has had a significant improvement to my mental state and how I feel about every day More optimistic more motivated So again my advice is start small                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
You is a way to be honest without being intentionally mean People do appreciate honesty in most situations The trick is learning which situations require tact it is something that just takes some study and practice So for your sister instead of telling her that her art is bad you could've said something like its not really my taste  I don't get it Which really art is subjective Because you think its bad doesn't make it so By saying that it isn't your taste you're being honest that you don't like it but you're not saying that it is objectively bad I'm sure that some will tell you that it doesn't matter what other people think about what you say and that its their problem if they get upset This is TRUE to a certain degree but it is still good to make an effort to avoid hurting people It just takes time to figure out how to say certain things and you should never be afraid to apologize

I am sorry you are having a tough time Sometimes it all seems to go to hell at once One thing goes wrong and its like the cars on a train piling up All I can think of to tell you is to take it one issue at a time Deal with one thing as best you can then worry about the next one Break it into manageable parts as it were I hope you can feel better and get some sleep That would help too

I'm I would like to say I am very sorry that this person you thought was a friend has turned out to be a piece of shit and a scumbag and is taking advantage of you I would also like to say that it's not your fault He knew that you were in a bad place mentally and he was the one who took advantage of that for his own sick gain You are not diminishing rape or sexual assault by posting this What happened to you is STILL a form of sexual assault and you are absolutely allowed to feel violated He had also from what you have written threatened you Do you still have the messages he sent you where he said he could make your life a living hell If you do save those I would advise taking legal action if you want to It is ultimately your decision and if you do absolutely keep those messages from him as evidence Nobody has the right to do this to you nor do they have the right to threaten you like this

Granted had aspergers then I was diagnosed with adult ADHD I was told by my age nothing could be done for aspergers but they could treat my ADHD You can have ADHD and aspergers its actually quite common                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
You this is one of the reasons I refuse UA testing So flawed and just creates problems It's so rare to find doctors who actually know anything about ADHD and these medicines The test is probably wrong because the dose is very low Drug tests aren't even supposed to pick up therapeutic doses                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
I gone out with friends after I stopped drinking although not as much Most people don't seem to care that I'm not drinking I do find while sober I have much lower tolerance for drunk people though

Congrats can't really tell you why I started I hated noFap with a passion But somehow I kept gravitating towards it again and again I guess my motivation can be summed up with Alright   fine  Aside from that I still really haven't found a reason to keep doing it Well I kinda have If I ever have sex  I want to make my partner feel like the sexiest woman ever  I don't want her to have to compete with the porn scenes in my mind  It's a pretty shitty reason though because the scenario of me having sex is more hypothetical than string theory With that said I did recently pass two months so something must keep me going right Well for one thing it's the naive hope that it might help with my depression anxiety and crippled self esteem And more interestingly I just have very little desire to watch porn and masturbate I quickly realized it's something I did out of habit and or boredom and once I consciously question the urges they go away almost instantly

Aww checking in Hang in there I wish I stopped at  I would have gained  years looking back now But I had to go thru it to get where I'm at now It's all forward from here When you wake up you have a new page on a  page book not my quote but read it today somewhere and it stuck with me                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Your year has gone from terrible to horrible I have nearly nobody to turn to especially in my times of need I only have one good friend now but a single person can't be here all the time Childhood fucked me up and now I'm here loathing myself knowing next year will be even worse than this one and feeling like all I want is attention so I won't let myself make a post

This a woman's instinct is strong indeed but you need strong evidence in case she ever tries to act on her feelings I think you should just try and separate your bf and your bff from each other Do you think your bff would act on her feelings                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Goodnight reference do a tldr I read about  of it Let me try to help a bit and make things as clear as I can I also am  also have a sister who is  close to  so u and I can kind of relate My sister doesn't live with me I won't let her move in for this reason I am not her mother and I refuse to tell her what to do You're mothering your sister Knock it off Your sister is  she will grow up on her own time line and she will do what she pleases when she wants to If she pays her portion of the bills then leave it at that You could ASK her to help with doing things but her bedroom that she pays for is none of your business and her laundry problem isn't your problem to worry about either If you've already established that she isn't coming with u and your kid and husband then let things be until the move and tell her ahead of time so she can make arrangements

So REALLY dumb but the only things that have managed to get through to me in the last few months and genuinely make me laugh is the situation on the TLC show Love at First Kiss with Josh and the Kitchen Nightmares clip You don't microwave a salad I don't even know what it was they're not what I'm generally amused by but I laughed like crazy for the first time in forever

Well have one person that I talk about it to Also go to psychiatrist but for some reason I find it really hard to tell someone that I have social anxiety I'm OK talking about that I'm depressed but the anxiety part is just so hard for me I feel like a failure because I'm afraid of socialising while everyone is out having fun Thanks I really appreciate it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
So games are different for me I consider playing them like playing the guitar Getting good at a video game is an achievement a kinesthetic activity that requires good reflexes and a lot of skill Take someone who has never played a guitar and someone who has never played a video game They'll probably have about the same manual dexterity and ability to understand how to play intuitively Gaming is not a passive activity like watching TV it takes work to be good and the sense of accomplishment one gets from mastering a game is no different than the feeling of mastering a hard musical piece on your instrument                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
My I'm glad you did not succeed Your life is like a whistling wind coming around a corner Wash your arm in warm water and wrap it well A nice warm soft scarf would feel so nice In time it will heal and fade as with all pain We are always hear to listen whatever is on your mind because you have worth                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Yes Art is subjective  People in general but especially women hate being called fat Yes I do have this problem and I don't have a one size fits all solution You're just gonna have to test the waters and practice with certain things

From put  calories in alcohol and not blink And then probably eat  more before bed At least I would have lol Least of my worries is food these days I'm treating myself during these holidays You should too Happy new year Thanks for the laugh                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
And for the advice my man I really needed this Still seeing a couple physical benefits but not enough mental ones It truly comes from a complete shift in your overall lifestyle and creating new habits to rid yourself from being railed on previous sluggish and automatic ones that don't expand or challenge your daily processes One of them being getting the fuck off Reddit like I should now                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Almost you can do then is file a complaint at the station File one about the neighbors and file another about the seemingly long or no response Nothing will likely happen but it will be on record at least That way they have a pattern for next time Presumably July                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Can it sucks that there is such a wide range of side effects that we are willing to tolerate over others It is hard to draw the line Tardive dyskinesia or obesity Sleep all day or perhaps some kidney failure I hate that it is so difficult to discern what exactly is causing the weight gain Like you when I am manic I am up all hours my body clock is all disturbed Food is also far tastier than usual I so wish that I only needed to take these medications in short term crises periods I find withdrawing from them so painful and frightening about relapse makes it so much worse

This is your secret I'm  and I've been jacking off ever since I was  I did it everyday when I was a sophomore because it felt fucking good Then again if you haven't been doing it much it's probably because you have something better to do I don't

Ok really can't help you directly unfortunately but what thought have you put into why you just let opportunities pass you by You're smart but evidently not driven to succeed For some maybe a lot of people like that they let life pass them by because it's easier to 'not do' than to fail but we all take our lumps The only way to get through life without failing is to do nothing but that in itself is the biggest failure of all You may never become a pro ball player the top lawyer at your firm the most exciting guy in the room or what have you but if you look down these paths then start to wander down them you'll eventually find yourself playing catch with your son teaching him about justice and doing the right thing and making your friends or SO's eyes light up when you walk into a room Along the way you'll catch a ball to the face get swamped with paperwork and embarrass yourself trying to make someone laugh but hell will it be worth it to actually live I hope you eventually find the answer is yes but I understand that putting in the effort needed for just a chance at happiness is daunting There's a lot to overcome and you won't do it in one big leap then tomorrow will be all peachy Baby step after baby step will take you miles if you don't quit

I get you My problem is that sometimes I do feel like I've lost I feel like there is no going back to the normal and that I will ever recover I guess I'll have to accept one day that its alright to not be like everyone else It's just so hard when I can't control my mind and thoughts                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Ask exactly what I've noticed Also because serial monogamy for a lot of us just feels better I notice a lot of semi break ups Like you never moved in with the person but you two just fade out and go your own ways after a month or two of dating as you move on to others Then sometimes you may get back with someone else again from before who knows The alternative is sex with lots of strangers Sure it sounds great in the fantasy of porn but in reality I'm not so sure I tried it a couple of times I remember hooking up with a girl and for all intents and purposes it was supposed to be a one time only thing since she lived in another country But of course we felt super awkward afterwards given those conditions in effect In fact realizing what she was doing she felt ashamed and wouldn't talk to me So instead we ended up becoming friends on Facebook and talking frequently This was now like  years ago and we still chat sometimes we have similar tastes in music So yeah even one attempt at anonymous hooking up didn't work for me

This I literally could have written this I'm going through the exact same thing she is moving to the other side of the country and I am all fucked up over it I'll tell you exactly how I am coping with this and believe me it goes against all my tendencies and it is tough but I feel good about it I know she's not one for long distance friendships so part of me wants to cut her out and leave her so she feels the hurt as well I know we won't be nearly as close when she is gone But I've decided I'm going to take the high road I'm going to enjoy every day that I can with her I'm going to support her with her move in any way she wants me to no matter how much it hurts I am going to be the person that she needs me to be for her as she goes through this change My rationale is it's going to hurt anyway so I may as well try and be the best friend to her that I can I do intend to tell her how much I will miss her and that my mental health might be a bit sketchy afterwards but for the most part I am just going to try to do what I feel is the right thing I don't want to fuck things up and have regrets about how I acted later but I know if I just try to support her I won't feel guilty later even if it does make me feel sad for a bit

I I have read from so called 'Ex FA's' were just people that never really been FA or just were at the right place right time That's not TRUE I did a lot self improvement and worked really hard to mean new people normie                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
From going to grow up and tell the kids about my Lamborghini in the garage Knowledge jokes aside this is why Reddit is my favorite website Because everyone can learn something and improve

Could can see you've put alot of effort in this post and have great ideas but I don't think this is the best way of following them I know that we have FA meetups here every now and then or do we I don't remember but wearing something like a badge singles us out even more Another big problem with this is that even if I identified another FA what would make me want to talk to them I know some people like me are deathly afraid of talking to strangers and have panic attacks just thinking about it Hell I can barely keep up conversations with normal people there's no way I can go chat up with someone else even if they are FA To be honest the thought makes me very uncomfortable Either way I think there should be an easier way to interact with other FAs in real life but I can't really think of one                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Porn got High off of brownies and had intrusive thoughts However while high I don't tend to respond to thoughts and remain extremely calmed This caused me to panic and now I'm anxious again But thank you so much for replying

 need to stop trying and start living Stop seeking for acceptance and accept yourself                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
I that can work for me is focusing on the areas I know I can control I can control the time I make for myself I can choose whether I make that time productive or not I can choose to develop new and fulfilling rituals like enjoying my coffee in the morning or taking time each week to exercise my creativity That was a start for me Sometimes I have to force myself to do those things It does help ground me I'm just suggesting this as perhaps a place to start Anything in life can be overwhelming if we look at the larger picture So maybe we refine the steps to take to get to the larger picture Apologies if this doesn't make as much sense as it does in my head                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Go getting buried but I just wanted to say that I had a serious drinking problem nobody knew of drinking a lot and getting blackouts regularly and I set myself to stop drinking to get my shit together Here I am on new years eve completely sober after spending a good time with some friends Just felt like sharing this since I really feel great even though it sounds so ridiculously small                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
I shit do I know this feeling My urges to watch porn and masturbate pretty much went away after a week or so but every now and then I have episodes where my mind is just constantly desiring sex It's like mental tinnitus that makes it super difficult to focus on anything else Getting sex is not an option for me though so I usually just have to wait it out The good news is that it will stop at least temporarily after a while What I think is helping me is meditation Twice a day for a few minutes personally I'm doing 2x7 sit down comfortably close your eyes and focus on your breath When a thought any thought enters your mind acknowledge its presence and have it move on What this does is it trains you not to get caught in certain thoughts So even when not meditating it's easier to acknowledge a thought for example about sex and just ignore it and move on                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
I Its great that you have something to do this for It makes it that much more enticing to do it and alot more rewarding to accomplish it I think that it is an added benefit that you have a hot gf that loves sex Stay on the path and never loose sight of the end Heres to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
 put it off too but I think if the habit gets started it will continue and become just part of your day I have more intrusive thoughts that I didn't mention and really feel that the journaling will help

It in a similar situation Stuck in a rut Go to the doctor a therapist someone There are people who will listen I picked out a random friend from way back in high school and he has helped me through just talking out the feelings Day by day it gets better but I still see the pain on my wife's face when I start to slide back down into the depression Just remember this You are not alone Those  family members care about you Talk to them It would mean the world to them That you would bring it to their attention

Welcome I agree I used to feel this way but now I realize I kinda do it to myself Like I don't go out of my way to talk to people or hang Even when I get invited places I normally turn it down so at some point people just stop inviting you to do things It's hard because  of the time I want to be alone but the one percent I wanna do something I can't find people to hangout with Also check out the song by die antwoord alien you may relate to it I know I do                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Sounds am sorry Alcoholism is heartbreaking The best thing you can do for your brother is to get support and information for yourself I went to Alanon meetings which helped me cope with the alcoholism of a loved one Alanon is a support group for friends and family of alcoholics See r Alanon You can talk to your brother but don't expect him to like what you have to say Denial is a primary symptom of alcoholism I cannot control another person's behavior but I can get help for myself Alanon meetings are almost everywhere

OK I'm naturally good at most shooting games I just have incredible luck when it comes to playing video games                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Happy do realize you're literally acting like the stereotypical neckbeard and nice guy right If this is who you truly are then this is the reason you're FA plain and simple                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Thank know the answer and will not advise you but I did find this thread https www reddit com r Drugs comments 2chsnz experience entering japan with drugs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 came to terms with what I have done and how I got to this level of depression I did as you did Bottled up emotions from work irritations personally etc til an incident with some family broke me Now I know my problem and am working on being a bit more open                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Someone spent my NYE at home staring at a ceiling I hope that superstition isn't TRUE At least if it is TRUE then that means I'll be sober                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Hope certain you are sipping water all day long Make certain you are eating your  meals a day with snacks It is easy to forget and not even notice and even possible to think you are eating and drinking but actually aren't consuming much at all                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
 this is exactly what happened to me As soon as I found out skipping classes at university had no immediate consequence bam I was done Likewise the mindset of 'this exam is very important' faded once I wasn't directly under the influence of my parents teachers peers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Is feeling pretty weird about being around anyone at all who is drinking It's like a barrier to connection I can see the disconnect in the eyes like no one is home I had a late lunch with a friend today and a drunk guy there tried to wish us a good new year He also waved his beer around rudely to ask the waitress for another It gave me huge anxiety to witness and be addressed by him like that So grateful I don't have to be that way ever again

Thank am not a doctor first of all I have had this experience on a few antidepressants though I know it is a side effect of some SSRIs It could potentially be a side effect of others Just reading this post made me feel like what you were describing I wonder if it could be something to do with a nervous system

Alcohol pretty much just had a smoke and some snacks then went to sleep Of course until I got woken up by next door and ended up watching science fiction shows Some good shit on TV right now shame everyone else is missing it To be fair I was going to go out but then I found out nobody else is going and I just got back from visiting family in Austria so I've got some pretty bad Jetlag and I'm still disappointed from going back to gross British coffee My best friend is coming over tomorrow anyway the only reason we're not dreading the new year together is because they're having their weekly horrific migraine Their new year is probably much much worse

 suck at the games where you have to use two controls Like you have the one joystick that moves the character's body and the other joystick that just moves where you're looking I wind up staring at the ceiling while walking backwards and all sorts of nonsense Platform games are much easier
