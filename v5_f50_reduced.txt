Thank you so much for the kind words  I'm a college student so it is admittedly hard to find people like that  All my friends back home in Jersey are varying degrees of heavy drinkers and so are the ones at school  Everyone seems to both poo poo my drinking but also scold me so I don't really have any productive help  I have a therapist I've been working with and I'm going to bring this up to my medical doctor when I go home in a week   Old College Try is a good one Thank you  Thank you  Thank you   I text her later and asked her if being affectionate at this point would be a bad idea for her recovery and she replied "I don't know  I don't want to think about anything right now  I love you "  She's telling you with words and behavior to not pressure her  When I was barely sober  needed time to figure out who I was and how to build a sober  happy life  You might be very distracting by putting pressure on her to be sexual when she has told you she doesn't want to deal with it right now  Please respect this fragile time in her life   I gotta be honest   I'm here just sobbing  I don't want to drink but I don't know how to get past this moment    I played the tape out and I will not drink  2016 was so bad for me  moving across the country  relapsing after 3  years      Come the fuck on 2017    I'm done  And I am so ready and willing to move forward with my life  Once I'm home from my christmas break I will be going to my regular doctor at the university clinic about it  I hope my life improves because it is pretty shit right now  I only started drinking heavily within the last 6 months or so  Everything just fell apart all at once and very rapidly  I had my apartment flood  lost my couch and rug  lost all of the deposits  had to fight for weeks to get out of the lease while being essentially homeless  lived on couches   my long term girlfriend and I split up rather abruptly  and then I had the worst semester of my entire academic career  So hopefully all I can do is go up    I'm staying in too  Home alone and feeling a bit lonely and depressed but I am sober  This is the first NYE I have been sober in   well  I couldn't even tell you how long  I think I need to work on building a social network  It's great that I'm sober but I can t sit home alone every night either  Anyways  happy new years everyone  I'd rather stay in and watch Three Stooges and Twilight Zone episodes but I'm going to my friend's party  I have no inclination or temptation to drink  The last time I drank this past Monday has supplied me with lasting memories of the negativities to keep me off forever  I hope    But one day at a time  I'll show up with my mug of tea and snacks to share tonight and probably head back home before midnight  I'll see you all here or tomorrow  sober again    How you doing  I'd also post to  r OpiatesRecovery   Sounds like you handled it well and your feelings are totally understandable  Just wanted to add though that it is  possible  your friend is really trying to be smart  protective and do the right thing   even though he is obviously getting it wrong  Only you know if it's that or if he's really an insensitive fucker  But I'm sure it will be obvious in time  With you over here  You got this  friend  I'd already made the decision to not drink tonight and I'll do it with you     A stronger man than I could ever be  After a nasty 5 day binge and extreme anxiety and aches  I will not drink with you today  I am so ready   Cancelled on the NYE Party I was invited to  and now I'm sitting here feeling like a depressed piece of crap   Also been suffering for horrible stomach cramps and off and on headaches   Normal withdrawal stuff   It's a week  would I still be experiencing this  I struggled with very similar feelings  Recently my relapse was just one big denial train  I'm here if you need to talk   Honestly staying home is the best option  fuck spending a night with all the new years drinkers  They don't know what the fuck they are doing  I'll be slammin natty ice all night on my couch  about as comfy as you can get I'm worried about a sip of champagne at midnight with the group I am celebrating with   I will be drinking craft sodas and tonic waters all night but I will get a glass of champagne around 11 55   I am driving and have no problem telling people I don't want to drink tonight but I'm worried there will be some pushing like "it's just a glass of champagne"   My plan is to hold it and put it down right away after midnight     I'm sure I can do it so I'm going to not be drinking tonight with all of you  Thanks  Granted  this is easier said than done  but I think you need to pack your shit and sleep on a friend's couch until you can get yourself situated   At this point  what is the point in staying   If you're unhappy  not upsetting the applecart is not a good reason to stay  You just echoed what I just posted   you're not alone   If that's any comfort  Progress made in the last year and one thing I'm hopeful about in the future   OMG man  I am so sorry   My friend here says it sounds unusual that he'd be put down for this   Hold out hope      Nice one  I'm a kiwi  Where are you hiking  I hope you have a wonderful trip  I'll either be dead or sober in a year You find out who your friends are in sobriety  The hard way   No problem  Im trying to convince myself that a positive outlook makes things easier  That was just me trying to look on the bright side  Lol glad i could send a smile your way Hanging out with anyone who is abusing alcohol sounds miserable to me  I avoided people and places that were risky  There's more to recovery than simply not drinking  So do you know if it's fear of eating associated feeling of physical pain when eating lack of actual hunger  Thank you  I'll keep that in mind I will do this  thank you    I haven't had a lot of drawbacks to my drinking  but I know for certain there aren't many benefits either  especially in the long term  Yes well if you work through the program you will learn who your real friends are  The more you surround yourself with other alcoholics the more you will realize you're not alone and there are others who can relate to your disease  So glad to hear you're being proactive  fellow natural ice drinker here  can comfirm    very comfy also love weed too I'm so sorry that you are sad   I know over on the SMART recovery chat they are having a NYE party if you are feeling lonely   I don't know if that's okay to post under the rules but I am hopping between here and there       What's the future like  Good  glad our experience can be of assistance   That's why we are here     You're not alone   We are all here  Party started and I'm doing good  Not drinking with you today  This is helpful  thank you   Haven't heard of the concept of maintenance drinking  That was definitely me although I would have stretches of time when I didn't drink at all  Nice to know there are others who are similar  Yup my Fear Of Missing Out is often based on the  possibilities  of an awesome night which are  if I'm to be honest wih myself  based on total fantasy  I have never ever regretted going to bed sober  I have never felt like I missed out the next day  but I have often regretted going out drinking  This   Not to say your current friend is a terrible person  but there were many people who I was friends with because we drank together   When I stopped drinking  some of my friends were still there and we still enjoyed hanging out with each other  and some of my friends "moved on"  and that's okay   It can be tough  and some of your closest friends may not be there when the dust settles  but focus on you right now  and the friends that stick will understand that and still work to include you in what they're doing  and some of it may involve others drinking  but a lot of it will not   Good luck  stay strong   One day at a time  and NYE is a hard day for everyone  Oh  and not drinking with you tonight  I am a runner and I squat as well     True  Facebook too for me  taking a break from social media works wonders sometimes  If that statistic is accurate  then I'm one of the 20  that hasn't relapsed  I don't take the first drink  If we don't take the first drink  we won't relapse    What's the point  I have a wonderful  happy sober life that I wouldn't trade for anything  I couldn't stay sober  though  without lots of help  especially in the early years  Therapy and AA helped me when I struggled   I won't be drinking tonight   For the next couple of weeks   r

like he was just looking out for you and had your best interests at heart  Try not to be too bothered  and have a convo about it with him to clear the air in the next few days  I'm sure it's not easy for your friends to deal with your lifestyle change  I'm still experiencing the same thing 8ish months into my attempts to quit  Just know that your true friends have your back  If this guy ends up not being one  then it'll free up time for you to spend with your real friends   I was definitely thinking about that for tomorrow  I have some free time  Tonight i dump the smokes in water before bed    can't beat the 6  and 50 cents a can my man  wishin I had some ganja too though Have a safe and Happy New Year  Ohay automod   3 I knew we hired you for a reason  This is strangely aggressive  especially since you don't know the friend  Lol Congrats  Thanks for letting me see into the future   I will not drink today  Welcome and don't feel shy to post   I have found this group to be the most supportive people ever   I am sorry you are feeling sad and isolated   I too drank because of social anxiety but then without any inhibitions I acted like a complete ass and have embarrassed myself and family and friends more times than I can count   I refuse to live like that anymore   If you are able  I'm reading the Naked Mind and it's really helping me    Sounds to me like you are having trouble with your real world problems and keep reverting to escapism in order to avoid the negative feelings of reality   The fact that you say "I can't explain but I have to play something     " means you are 100  using video games as a mind numbing drug to take you away from your issues  You have trained your brain to the point where gaming becomes a reflex when the going gets tough  which is a habit you must break now   Your grades are suffering  your life is suffering  and your future will be a bad one  Face your issues instead of running  I would highly recommend you start a small goal which is something like "14 days of no gaming"  This includes no gaming  no watching videos streams on gaming  no gaming message boards  etc  Fight through the withdrawal symptoms and learn to be at peace with yourself through boredom  There are many other hobbies you can have that do not have the addictive properties of gaming    Alrighty  I'm at home  Ordered some Chinese  and will probably rent a movie and drink some tea  My friend invited me out tonight  and just texted me again urging me to join  I thought about it  but I'm just not in the mood  I'm not necessarily happy  and I'm not sad  I feel blah  I could see going out just making wish I were drinking so I'd prefer to avoid that tonight  I've felt kinda dizzy and tired today  not really sure why  But I am looking forward to getting a good nights rest tonight  and kicking tomorrows ass   Happy New Year PG  I'll be on and off of here tonight  Mom's sick  Hope you have a nice evening  Thank you  I'm glad that I can find support in thus group  I've noticed improvements already  I just have had a hell of a week Someone else mentioned clonodine    it's just a blood pressure med  but it has this amazing effect of making a lot of the withdrawal symptoms go away  Just keep in mind that it will lower your BP quite a bit and you might get light headed or passout when you stand up    I should add   a little alcohol can help with symptoms as well  but don't do this for more than a few days    After day 4 5 it's all downhill  Keep in mind that when you workout it makes your body produce endorphins  which are very similar to morphine  think endo morphine  and can help symptoms a lot    Good move on getting off the opiates  Those things are just    evil    Oh  one more thing about clonodine   it's not controlled and is not addictive  There is zero abuse potential  If you take it for a long time and suddenly quit taking it  you may have high BP for a little  so be sure to not take it too long  and if you do  taper off and watch your BP   Most patents don't have issues with this  but I figured I'd mention it anyhow    Any questions feel free to PM me  Thank you for sharing  I fear the same for myself  I am going to try this year to be sober  or at least make a solid effort  I know the ramifications of getting caught drinking  I just have to keep telling myself the penalty of drinking and getting caught far out ways whatever good time I might miss  Maybe I'll just be the DD for my friends  Be something helpful for them  Breaking Bad is the best  I'll check out Red Oaks   We can do it  I would also like to know the answer to this  Help me OP wan kenobi    What sounds boring is hanging out with intoxicated people  I'd have more fun at home alone with a book or Netflix   I'm no medical professional  and I guess everybody's different  but my experience quitting cold turkey from averaging half a bottle of whiskey every night for over a year  edit  and a bit less for years before that   quitting 12 days ago has been very calm    Granted  that's equivalent to about 8 9 shots  so perhaps less than you      but some nights I did manage to down a 3 4 of a bottle  I'm a skinny guy so it tended to hit me kinda hard    Since I quit I have been sleeping a lot  practicing self soothing techniques for my anxiety  found via Google   and journaling my feelings whenever I get upset  I drink a lot of water and try to eat healthy  sometimes I just stare at the walls  but I know as long as I don't drink it doesn't really matter what I do  within reason    I hope that helps       Happy New Year to everyone   I will not drink today  or even past midnight  I pay 2 50 for a forty so a little bit more  I have one joint of some serious dank and a few grams of garden weed  Gotta fill my jars up  There is no reason to feel any anxiety or fear because you're giving up nothing  There literally isn't a single thing you enjoy right now that you can't enjoy without stinking like Marlboros and spending hundreds of dollars per month while ruining your health and co stanly interrupting your life   It takes a lot of time  money and mental energy and constantly puts stress on your body  When you quit  you will go through a couple days of discomfort and a few weeks of mental challenges and then it's all over  If you continued smoking  you would go through routine withdrawals multiple times per day for the rest of your life   Being a smoker is much  much harder than quitting  You will do it this time and you're never going to regret it  I just want to say hi and introduce myself  I signed up and subscribed yesterday    I'm not and haven't ever been addicted to porn  However  I would like to make a commitment not to watch it at all in 2017  Even though I wasn't ever addicted to it  I still recognize the bad influence it can have on people  I realized that I looked at women in a mostly sexual way and found it hard to just be friends with women  It also reduced my stamina in bed  which is the opposite of what I want long term  I've been porn free for a little over a month already and would like to keep it that way throughout 2017   Thanks for reading if you did  Its 7 15 here  and I've had my PJs on for a while  It will be sooo nice to wake up in my PJs instead of my alcohol cig  smoke smelling clothing  Not drinking with you tonight    Yeah I'm in the same boat as you pretty much  Just me myself and my inhaler lol  What state are you in  Mass   You'll make it through this  You'll wake up tomorrow and won't have to worry about the guilt or shame  you can instead wake up well rested  I thought about drinking myself tonight  and Instead im ordering some food and am going to rent a movie  Just make it through today  that's all you gotta do   Checking in  it's going well  I have alcohol in front of me but don't feel like drinking it  Dr  Sinclair  thank you   I don't want this to come off like I'm pushing AA or any other fellowship    The biggest thing I got from going to meetings were friends who are also sober  They are the biggest part of my support group and I always have sober people to do things with    I didn't do the steps  I didn't go to meetings that made me feel uncomfortable or angry in anyway  I found some that had some young people and I made friends with them    I hope you have a great new years  Make sure you talk very loud tomorrow on that 8am phone call      Kudos for 32 days            I needed lots of support in early sobriety  A therapist  rehab  education  outpatient  and involvement in AA helped me handle cravings and the tough times  Eating something sweet helped me with cravings  too  as did doing something physical  I hope you have the support you need and deserve  I didn't think it was fair to put the responsibility for my sobriety on a family member so I found it elsewhere  Have a great new year  Alright I'll bite   Lemme get a pic of the leggings  I've looked everywhere and I can not find a 40 of natty ice where I'm at  Only the natty light  but whats the point of that  only 4 2   My 40 of choice is hurricane  8  and smooth af Go somewhere no one can hear you and    SCREAM AS LOUD AS YOU CAN    Get angry at it  Let it piss you off  knowing how much control a lifeless object can have over your body    Let yourself   feel   the need to change  Sign me up plz  Let's do this  Sign meh up plz  Got a one day streak already lol I'm made myself familiar with it via research but going on day 5 tomorrow  I think it's pointless to try to obtain  I know that exercise is the biggest thing  I've never been happier than when I was a workout freak    it's just tough to re establish that routine when your brain is all funky  For me  I know it's the answer though    Other than that I'm super into vitamins supplements nutrition but I have no idea if it really helps or not  It's almost like a side addiction of mine  A lot of great suggestions so far  I particularly like this one  I can't imagine any other of the 24 meetings there today will have used it For the next couple of weeks   r cripplingalcoholism is participating in our yearly population survey   Please take a few moments to answer

find  Therapy and AA helped a great deal  Meetings gave me a safe place to go where people understood   From what I can tell your friend has good intentions  but not tact  He is throwing a drinking party  You are a little over a month sober  great job    I can see how one would think it may not be wise to 'tempt' you with an invitation to a drinking party when youre trying not to drink  If you did relapse  maybe he would have felt responsible  You are upset though   sounds like he should have handled it way better  The keeping it secret thing is crappy  Keep your head up  I wont drink with you tonight  Hey hey hey  I don't have much to say  You may feel lonely  but you're not alone  I'm a little late to reply  but so hope you're feeling better by now   slurricane    strong enough to start an engine mang    As for "progress"  Naming only one or two things could be suggested  depending how many people are there  so no one monopolizes  I think we sometimes forget about how far we've come   I know the fact that i hate it  i know that i need to change  Just saying   It is  Thank you  TBH  that guy doesn't sound like such a good friend to me   Maybe he's more a drinking buddy or party friend   Either way  I am sorry that you are feeling hurt and left out   that is one of the worst feelings and I can understand why you're pissed  I would be as well   I really have no good advice but to say that I think you are certainly entitled to feel the way you do and I think that recognizing it's a trigger and still not drinking is really strong and smart of you     P S   I'm chugging a coconut La Croix  what flavor is yours       Good  I am very please to hear things are the same  if not better  and not worse    Yeah  things are pretty good  I have a horrid sinus infection and the antibiotics are making pee out of my ass which is miserable  but the sinus infection is going away   Watching the Wild vs Blue Jackets game a Clemson vs Ohio State game at the moment   Enjoy the rest of your night  Thanks man   just thanks  Read your comment and decided to do just that  Thank you   You have bigger problem on your hands than the DUI  I am not in your marriage but it sounds torturous and painful  DUI is expensive  embarrassing and stays on your record for life but you need help and support in this moment of your life  I got a DUI my self 2 years ago and felt absolutely horrible  The alcohol education classes that I had to take were completely useless and total waste of time but there was one good thing that the counselor said  "Look deep down in you and find out what makes you drink"  boredom  shitty friends  way to escape  and I have the feeling that your marriage may be the root of your drinking  Happy NY and good luck   Continue with your actions so he can look to you when he realizes that the problem lies with alcohol   I don't need to know him to know that he's not a good friend  Friends lift us up when we are down  support us  include us and love us  They don't go out of their way to exclude us because of a healthy new lifestyle    If he were truly a friend  he would have asked him outright and had an honest conversation about it    As someone who's struggled with so called friendships through the years  I completely relate and identify with OP  That feeling of being left out  and excluded and like you don't belong brings me right back to those feelings I had before I got sober  Obviously OP is rather upset by it all too  It's a shitty feeling  and we don't deserve to feel that way from someone who we thought was a good

meaning people happens all the time  and thanks to our friend conformation bias  it seems even more common when we look for it    Sometimes however  people might not mean well and be trying to make some sort of indirect point  Either way  full steam ahead  I had an experience of someone meaning well and pissing me the fuck off that I recall often  When at dinner with a friend  when I was still only about a year sober  the waitress came over and asked if id like to hear the beer list  My friend cut me off and exclaimed "oh no  He's not allowed to drink "  I wasn't embarrassed by my sobriety  I was embarrassed that my friend felt he had to babysit me  Like it was only through the constant guarding of others that I managed to scrape out a year already  dodging bullets every day  Wanna know what I did  I calmly said that I was an adult and could do whatever I wanted  I asked the waitress to hear the list  I ordered a beer I thought sounded good  Then I let the beer sit there on the table all dinner  like a big hot pile of shit  He kept uncomfortably looking at it  and I didn't think about it twice  Because I chose not to drink it  just as I had managed to do for a year before and three years since  We live in a world full of liquor  if proximity or availability is the only thing keeping us sober  we've already relapsed  Stay strong  Six months sober and my first sober NYE in nearly 30 years  Congratulations to all and to all a safe and happy New Year  Just drink vodka in the shower with the shower water as chaser  And if we're being honest here fuck the food  That does nothing but slow a night down   Lee I follow you closely on SD but rarely respond    thx for your message tonight  I'm lost in Cincinnati and very alone right now    Playing   walking my dog too    It's new years day morning in Australia and I'm about to take him for a walk x   Also  I used to love to paint and draw  It's something I'm starting to do again    I used to read for hours in bed at night  I haven't done that for so long  So writing this reminds me that I want to start reading again  I love getting lost in a good book  An inspiration  Ringing in the New Years with that monkey off your back  I was suffering a lot early 2016  I feel like a different person now  Keep going man   3  You did it  So happy for you  Let's keep going in 2017   Wish I could agree with the two week part  it seemed much easier during the first two than it does now  Regardless  I'm gonna pull through and so are you  We've got this  Awh I love this post  Your little get together sounds like it's going to be a great time  Have a very happy new year  and a happy birthday too  Thank you for sharing   No  Let's all go the fuck to bed    its the safest place for us  Well for me anyway  To be fair  I've lit cigarettes backwards while stone cold sober  it still sucks Over 25 wasted  wasted New Year's Eves  I agree 100  Eh I'm okay with a slower tonight if it makes tomorrow at all easier  Plus my stomach is so empty I don't think it's gonna hurt too much  I'll still be blasted  If it can prolong how long I last I'm cool with it  Plus I'm just hungry too haha I used Kratom daily for 7 years  since I  was 16  because I could not imagine feeling happiness from anything but drugs  Even when I had gotten clean from it and was exercising daily I still felt miserable  It was only when I realized I lacked the happy chems that most people have in normal amounts did I actually get the medication that has allowed me to enjoy life    I take a drug that keeps my dopamine from breaking down  Welbutrin   allowing me more motivation juice to get things done  Additionally I take Lamictal which acts as a neurprotectant against the degeneration of brain tissue that depression causes    Note that kratom brings pleasure by stimulation of the mu opioid receptors and unfortunately chronic use downregulates these receptors  a bad thing when the kind of people that tend to use opioids chronically already have less receptors than average   meaning they experience less pleasure in general and have a higher sensitivity to pain    The best way to produce natural opioids is through exercise and there is also some evidence to suggest that use of opioid antagonists  like narcan  in small doses can actually upregulate the receptors    Good luck and I recommend you stay away from ssris because they seem to be bullshit   Congrats   Have a peaceful night and a happy New Year  Oh no   I'm sorry to hear that   I'll glad she has you   Sending Cyber Hugs  Love it  Think about it as a victory for your sobriety and not a loss for your social life  I stay home on NYE and St Patrick's day specifically to avoid all the trouble and drunken shenanigans that are a byproduct of the celebrations  Boring  Maybe  But it gives me personal satisfaction for keeping with my beliefs and staying sober which is more important to me by a lot   This all depends on the person itself  I hate sports games  so in a social setting if I was pressured into playing I think I could be able to handle it just fine without relapsing  but it is a scary thought to think of   But everyone is different  Just having a controller in your hands  seeing the flashing lights on the screen  sitting in a chair feeling comfortable  will all trigger signals in your brain that may try and get you to relapse again    I will tell you this though  when Overwatch came out I tried it a few times and absolutely hated it  I was about 2 months into my no gaming diet  and I went over to my friends house for a party  They had a few PS4s set up and they were all playing Overwatch  They all kept telling me to play  and since I already knew I hated the game  I figured it would be harmless to play it a few times with them because I knew I wouldn't care about it once the party was over  So we played all night  and when the party was over I still hated the game   The next day I was at Best Buy and while I was browsing the electronics I saw the Overwatch display  In this weak moment of mine  I thought it might be fun to casually play the game a little bit and learn how to be at least average at it so when I do go over to my friends house again I have something we can all do together and have fun  Because even though I disliked the game  it was still fun playing all night with them regardless of what game we even played  It felt like harmless social entertainment and they all were pretty good at the game so I wanted to fit in better   So the first few weeks I casually learned the game  There were no issues  I played a game here and there  I learned a couple of characters and figured I was competent enough to at least keep up with them  I wanted to see how good I was though  so I eventually tried out ranked to see how I stacked up   Well  this quickly turned into full blown zombie addiction mode where I proceeded to play 12 14 hours a day for the next month  Even the game I hated so much  got me  After this I realized I just can't handle games no matter what  Congratulations  My first sober NYE in over 25 myself  Happy New Year  This post right here  A old friend of mine who is still actively abusing alcohol  tried to tell me my drinking wasn't that bad or I can always just cut down when I first stopped drinking  I think when I quit it made him examine his own drinking habits and he didn't want to accept that it was not healthy or normal  I love the activity in this sub the past few hours  Fuckin cheers  pal  I am pretty happy because I have two handles of whiskey  My dog  My cigarettes and horror films  This is the best NYE I would hope for  Well done    When you wake up you'll be refreshed and feeling great  Great post  Happy new year I'm right there with you guys just far behind your progress  It's been weird being actually sick during withdrawal  Sort of a mental fuck  Relaxing with meds teas humidifiers and praying for some sleep  Watching some CFB now and will be rooting on my Giants at 1 tomorrow  Hoping to get some mental reprieve soon  20  is a far cry from 0   No one said it would be easy  But  those are way better stats than I was expecting   What a great evening  which will quietly transition into the first sober day of the Year   I'm with you  Wonderful start to the New Year  Wishing you joyous and sober 2017  Good to hear  stay sober  squirrel  Good for you for not drinking  and I won't drink with you tonight  I faced my coworkers after my shitfaced xmas party by saying sorry I was such as ass the last time we were together  I was so surprised by how many people expressed a desire to quit drinking  Good luck   Challenge yourself  but take it one step at a time    I think cancelling on the party was a wise decision  After the initial withdrawal window  usually a few days to a week for me each time I've tried to stop   I experienced post acute withdrawal symptoms  PAWS  months after  I did a lot of research on PAWS in the first weeks  and now when I'm not feeling that great  I don't feel as bewildered as I did in the past  Congratulations on making it a week and happy New Year  Great job the way you handled this   crying instead of drinking    Well done and be proud of yourself   I think you'll be moving on friendship wise when you want to  I had dreams for months  The relief that I didn't drink was so great that I kind of miss the drinking dreams  Stay strong and enjoy this sober New Years with me  I will not drink today  For anyone outside of your relationship  it's very hard to make a judgement call like this  and all they can do is base it on their own personal experiences mixed with your summary above     That being said  it sounds like she's trying to be as kind as possible while asking you to give her space as she works out her own things   "she said she needed to get her brain rewired before us picking up where we left off"   I would honor that  and be comfortable that she knows you're there to support her when she needs you  but for now give her the space she's requested and proceed with your life  10 45 am on the first right now  My friends are all either hungover or still drunk  It was so hard not giving into peer pressure last night but I made it through  Thanks to everyone here for giving me some place to check up on in the night   Thank you  you too   https   imgur com FaFDBJG  I don't know why my legs look two different sizes  and no  I don't normally dress in obnoxious neon bullshit  My roommate gave them to me when we were both fucked up recently  I'm trying to quit so I can pass a drug test to be a firefighter EMT     How can smoking be more important than that  I hate who I've become sometimes  Sounding so weak  I need to stop   I will stop  In the same boat my man   That's wonderful  Starting the New Year off right  And I'm sorry you're not having the greatest evening   hang in there  She is on disability so she has some form of medicare   When I got out of rehab  I watched Breaking Bad in under 7 days  I'm now starting Breaking Netflix  Thanks  Maybe not malintent but definitely misdirected   Love it    I think a big factor in this is how long you have been drinking that amount  Could you let us know how long it's been  And best wishes Yes   Smoked my last one at 11 50pm  crushed the rest of the pack and threw it out  I'm done  We can do this    I agree  I'm particularly bothered that I wasn't even given the option to come  And not that he was particularly concerned about my sobriety  he just didn't want me  gasp    the alcoholic   to end up drunk at his party   I'm a big Giants fan too  Where you from  awesome work to those you stayed clean throughout this year  NC  Part of the reason I think I have the fuckin cold  The weather can't make up its mind here  we go from 28 70 in a day sometimes  Clinks your nonexistent champagne flute  My first sober NYE in 28 years  Cheers to us  NDV      Woo   There's a difference between court ordered rehab  and wanting to be clean  I've been to rehab  most people  including myself  were forced there  either by the government  court  or significant others spouses    I've reached a point that I WANT to stop  Not because someone is telling me  Not because I got in trouble with the law  But because I'm sick of what it's doing to my life    Actually wanting to stop versus being told to stop is where you separate yourself from that statistic  Now your chances of remaining sober are much higher  This made me smile      You to     Let's rock 2017  My emotions were a roller coaster the first few days          Have any CBT  grounding or anxiety tools  Been drinking in general since I was 19  i just turned 24   I started drinking this much about 2 years ago I agree with you  OP is mad for being abandoned and "left out " but at 37 days I can't imagine going to a NYE party where everyone is drinking  I think the friend truly had OP's best interest in mind here   Where are you located  My "friends" kind of pulled the same stunt  so if you want someone to chat with and ring in the new year  I'm just going to be hanging around Oh wow I had no idea there was a survey  sure am glad a post finally brought it to attention  Happy new year   I don't think you damaged your brain    Current neuroscience has found that simple things like exercise and group therapy can have a profound impact in healing the brain    There is no try  there is only do or do not  watching starwars right now    Seriously though  if you want to quit then you're going to need to quit completely  Delete your dealers number    What happened to months 6   7   Deal  I think that is your old username  Anyways    I know who you are  I will not drink today   You hit the nail on the head on all points  A side note  I haven't been able to quit  Be better than both of us  For me and yourself  Holidays centered around alcohol are the hardest  I want to go out and have fun  and instead I'm working and sober and feel lonely  Despite that  though  I'll be sober tonight  Not just am  but will  I will remember my first night of 2017   Do something that makes you happy that doesn't involve smoking weed    Buy yourself something instead  go exercise  post on this subreddit  repeat  That's what I have been doing when I have cravings and it's helped for the most part    Good luck and happy new year friend  Awesome    Happy new year  Happy new year  I can't wait to see how I feel next New Years  Happy you feel different this year  Ugh the number of shitty things I've done because "New Years" or "St Patricks Day" or  y'know  just "Friday"    We made the right choice tonight for sure   Never posted here  This is day 3 of me not drinking and my grandfather passed away this morning  I wasn't really close to him but my dad who my girlfriend and I are staying with is pretty upset  I am gonna take them to meet some of her friends at a bar later to ring in the new year   Normally this is a time when I would get drunk to help "deal with it" but the truth is my grandpa was an alcoholic since he was a teenager up until the last 5 or 6 years when he had to stop or die and his passing is even more of a reminder of why I don't need to drink   I'm gonna be there for my dad and have a good night with my girlfriend and the bonus is they have a free dd  I feel good right now  I'm not gonna drink tonight  other than gingerale lol  because not only do I not need to  but the truth is I really don't want to   Happy New Year everyone To add to this   I am on Day 8 and I have found my cravings only last a few hours at the most and then I forget and move on to something else  Try to remember that    you won't feel like you want to call your dealer forever   You know who I am  I'm not sure if I should be more worried about that or what tomorrow is gonna bring  It's hard to speak in the " i " on this one  I  had tunnel vision when I wanted to get sober  When I was on day 37 I was focused on my sobriety not what others were doing  If I didn't get invited to a party it was a "blessing"   it meant God was looking  out for me    I know AA doesn't really take the holidays off  but in your experience  is Al Anon the same   Al Anon meetings would follow school closings during bad weather  that I do know  When my aunt died this last year  I immediately felt grateful for AA and meetings  In light and in tragedy  sobriety is amazing and I feel fortunate to have it  I will not drink with you today   Man  I wish there was a way to get more awareness out      p If it's just ashes I'd still drink the beer  Started today so as not to be hungover in the morning   Start the year off right    Beautiful southern Nevada  My girlfriend has an inhaler  I'll be hitting the shit out of it  Haha  How are you  Still coughing up lungs  Relapsed on the 29th  went on a two day binge  Been clean today  but I got  10 that I'm trying not to spend on a bag   This is only my experience  so take it with a grain of salt  please do take the detox seriously  but it honestly might not be as bad as you think it will  I was drinking that much and sometimes more every day by the time I quit  I was at that many drinks for 6 months a year  and didn't have any issues with withdrawals at all    It's definitely best to start with medical advice  being brutally honest  I started by talking to my doctor  who referred me to an outpatient clinic  and it was the best thing I've ever done for myself  Wishing you the best in the new year  I hope to hear from you soon that you've come through this and are on the road to sobriety  I won't drink with you     I would venture to say those folks that made those negative remarks are either in denial themselves or cannot understand where we are coming from    Glad you're here   Let yourself cry  it's ok   You don't have to know how to get past this moment  this moment will get past you   I'm here holding space for you  Good on you  It's hard but have that strength  Since I've stopped drinking  waking up not feeling like shit is amazing  Keep it going  Keep it strong  We've all got today  I've smoked skoal out of a bong on a dare   Yeah i somehow still got a cough  Its not terrible but I still have this gross shit coming out when I cough  I'm just physically beat too  So tired all the time  Hi  I would just like to ask if you are me  I'm at a year clean tomorrow and I filled out my time exactly the same way  Only difference is I taught my ferret to walk on a leash  I'm staying in and celebrating with my kiddos tonight  Nothing feels better than being sober and present with these two amazing people    Feeling tremendously grateful for SD  I found you wonderful sobernauts a little more than 2 yrs ago and soon I'll be celebrating two sober  healing  harrowing trips around the sun thanks to SD  therapy  and moving my feet when my head got too tangled     It just sucks when you have no money after rent and bills Tbh I've been seeing this shit for weeks but didn't notice today was the last day  I half assed did it on my phone just now but would have done it more thoroughly if I were near a computer   OP please do this   Thank you Agreed  We can't expect "normies" to know everything about what we're going through and what we can and can't handle  If I didn't know better  I'd probably have the same misconceptions as OP's friend    OP is early on in his her recovery  so it's totally reasonable to have the reaction he she had  but as time moves on and the sobriety days add up  situations like this are great teaching moments to let our friends and family in on the truths surrounding addiction and recovery    That said  I'm sorry you're being left out OP  We're all here to celebrate your sobriety with you tonight   Harvard has a 5  acceptance rate  That doesn't mean a kid with a 4 0   good test scores has just a 5  chance    Addiction recovery rates are low  across the board  But it's not a lottery  It doesn't matter if the recovery rate is 5  or 95   Whether you make it or not is entirely up to you   Sweatpants are on  the cooking has begun and I'm ready to ring in the new year full and happy  Let's do this SD  Declined a party invite but they were only asking to be polite they knew I wasn't going  Felt good to get asked though     I'm home from spell early  Sober  Maybe going to a guy frowns house I haven't seen in years  probably will get flaked on  So I'm a little antsy to see what will happen Happy New Year  u Phredex     I'm safely tucked up in bed  tummy full of nibbles and soft drinks after spending tonight at home with my three lovelys  Night night x  Not drinking today i'm staying in too  i dont want to get killed driving home and i dont really have anyone to spend the new years with  i ran this morning in the rain in preparation for a half marathon and i drove home sad that my rest day is tomorrow and i'll just be stuck by my lonesome trying not to go crazy until monday when i get to run again   Take care out there  We're only a few taps away on your phone if you need to check in again  Hang in there   Isn't it nice when at 1 am you're not who they're looking for   Great job  Congratulations   Welcome to sober 2017  I know I'm not far along  but I sent my boyfriend off to his NYE party and I'm in my pajamas playing the Witcher 3  I'm okay with this    However  I'm super tired and might not make it to midnight lol  Is there a non alcoholic option for a toast  So like  come hang out with me and we can walk our animals together  Sounds like a good time to me   Also congrats on a year clean  That's such a long time  Congratulations on your first soberversary  this is great news   Wishing you a fantastic 2017 love n hugs x Sounds like a good plan  Yeah  I've been there   For me it didn't turn out that badly  that particular person was drunk and it barely registered   I remembered when I behaved like him  I was more worried about what I said that pissed someone off while I was drunk   You shouldn't feel like shit  you stuck up for yourself and did great   Congratulations and I won't drink with you  Hi  are you OK  If I didn't feel 100  solid I'd leave  Because I know that if I do something I'm just 99  sure of 100 times I'll fail once   It's the difference between gambling and investing   Welcome  You've got one hell of a journey ahead of you  Just remember that it's worth it  and so are you  Well  it's all perspective  I was once a chronic relapser  I'd make it 30 60 days and then go back out for months  sometimes years  This time  I tried sobriety differently  coming here to SD and AA  and have almost 7 months  and I don't feel worried at all about making it to a year    I've also met people through AA who have relapsed after serious  time   One in particular that I can think of was sober for 17 years  then relapsed and stayed drinking for 7 years  now has almost 2 years sober again  Honestly it doesn't matter how much time any of us have   relapse is something we'll always have to be careful about   That said  the statistic probably makes a good point in that the longer time you have  probably the easier it gets to keep going   Yea   Im netflixed out  I cant wait for a selection change  I wont be hanging with intoxicated ppl necessarily  I just moved to the west coast and we would be playing games online  I dont think i could handle sitting in the same room with a bunch of drunks  Especially nye drunks      Boy it sure did for me   It took me about 3 weeks to balance out  although I have to admit I really wasn't good at dealing with anxiety   Turns out its one of those skills I didn't have that I covered by drinking  Thank you for sharing this  Are you in any danger   Do you need someone to talk to or do you need emergency personnel  Fun fact  the concept of peer pressure was invented by cats in ancient Egypt   Congratulations   Well done  You kind of look like Negasonic Teenage Warhead  You are rocking it  What a wonderful idea    Happy new year Yeah  I can relate to that for sure   Would you care to expand   Also  the chat below is a good real time conversation   Are you in immediate physical danger  My emotions were a wreck for at least 2 months  It takes time  On the upside  if I didn't like how I was feeling I only had to wait 20 minutes til the next mood swing  You can do it   But only if you actually are done and want to quit   You have to concede to the fact that you will never  ever smoke another cigarette for the rest of your life     If that's truly what you want  you will succeed    So glad for this special check in  My husband just got home from a long day and opened a beer  For a split second  I wanted one too  But then I remembered why I won't  So  I'm still not going to drink tonight  Did something bad happen or just a bunch of stuff piling on  So happy for your post  I am lucky to get almost 6 hours of sleep at night  I would really like more  you give me hope    Do it for your friend  I'm terribly co dependent  but it's helped me   Just a suggestion and what helped me the first time  spend your  10 on some liquor and avoid crystal for a week or so  Then try kick down the liquor    Remember who you used to be  and don't beat yourself up  You're worth more than that  Stay out your head   I should have thought this through better  I live in another country  and I usually visit in the summer  So I'm stuck here  but I am not drinking  If things get too bad I'll just go to bed  i just relapsed after my 40 days over  christmas  youre not alone  shit happens  be aware of your breathing and where you are right now  youre alive n human  we all make mistakes  now just eat some cupcakes and be kind to yourself  Did you go for the evaluation  Same here  glad to know that I am not alone  Great post  I have recently re discovered creative writing  I used to love writing short stories  poetry  even attempted a novel when I was about 16  I'm sure it was terrible    I'm fairly artistic in several ways   I like to do photography and draw a little  too    Last month I randomly came up with a story idea  too late for NaNoWriMo though   and I've been slowly writing on it ever since  I'm up to 20 000 words and it's just awesome to get lost in the characters  I'll be working on it tonight as I wait for the new year   Man that sucks   I've had some wonderful fights I've totally forgotten about   I've actually had my wife waiting for me to apologize for something and I really had no recollection of what   Not doing that now is certainly a big advantage to sobriety    You are so welcome here  as am I   It took me years of lurking before I made my first post and I am glad I finally did because posting and commenting here has been a far bigger help in me staying sober than anything else I had tried on my own   Best of luck to you and hope to see you around    I understand where she is coming from in regards to  sort of  ending your relationship  I have done this many times myself  I felt that my eating disorder was stronger than my relationship s  and I wanted to put all my energy into my disorder rather than the relationship    if that makes sense lol  The eating disorder even makes you think that you don't deserve a relationship or deserve to be happy  I also felt strongly that I was a burden to every one around me  Your GF might feel this same way    Like the other poster said  you can't help someone who doesn't want to be helped  You can be there for her to support her  but you can't do the work for her  You can text her everyday and ask her how she's doing    just knowing that one person out there cares about her will help  Remind her that she is beautiful and worth it   As for treatment    she needs to see a therapist  at least once a week  I don't know what her financial situation is but this is really crucial to getting better  She won't be able to do it on her own  There a lot of resources online  if you live in the Canada   www nedic com has a lot of good resources  And https   www nationaleatingdisorders org if you live in the states   I wouldn't have wanted someone to do this to me when drunk   its not very nice   Have you had any success fighting cravings before   If so  what worked for you  Ok   then it's just a matter of finding a place that takes it  there are hundreds that do  the last time I went I was on disability and have Medicare call the addiction hotlines  do a Google Search  you will find plenty of options Agree 100   don't think I've ever heard anyone say it's a good idea to be around alcohol in early recovery  Smart   If I was at a party   someone handed me a drink I didn't want  I'd drink it  Can't waste alcohol  right  But if that person had instead handed me a Pepsi I didn't want I'd have no problem setting it down   walking away    My addict mind assigned far too much value to alcohol   I would dump it  It doesn't sound honest  loving  or kind to me  As bad their behavior sounds  each group is self governed  If the group conscious agrees with that meeting style then it's ok   My ferret does get along with cats really well    Also thanks  How much clean time do you have  Feel free to scroll back to my early posts  I was all over the place  And it's very normal  I think many of us have covered anxiety with alcohol  For me  I did it for years  Once we aren't drinking anymore  it hits full force  Thankfully  it does get better  I'm not saying I never have anxiety  I do  And when it hits  it's still the full force  I can't stop thinking about it kind of anxiety  I've found it doesn't last as long and I am able to quiet my mind much easier   You can do this  Don't wait for the cravings to go away   prepare in advance for how to handle them  Think of times situations when you automatically reach for a cigarette  Those will be the hardest times  Replace that trigger with something else  like drinking water  chewing gum  going for a walk  or whatever  and soon the habit will be replaced  Its not easy  but YOU can do it    I did it  It's 1 24am on 1st Jan 2017 and I didn't have one drop of alcohol tonight  even though I was offered a completely free bottle of wine  and then a glass of someone else's wine  a few hours ago   I had a great night in  crazy tired now so gonna go to bed  Happy New Year  everyone  Oh no  Sorry to hear   What's going on  Going to bed early is a great escape route   Best part is that there's always a brand new day waiting on the other side      I only passed out in front of my family once  I have some unnamed sleeping condition    OK   We would like people to only post when they are sober  out of respect for those who are sober and struggling right now   Can you please try and post tomorrow morning when you are sober   drinking fizzy apple juice out of a champagne glass   So this is what the people of Bel Air be livin' like    We've got a bottle of the same in the fridge  Happy NY  I have been really lucky to be off work this week while I go through the first few days  I told my doctor  but he didn't prescribe anything  I am sleeping a lot  exercising  going to one meeting a day  drinking fizzy stuff and tea  eating chips and chocolate   basically babying myself for a week  I am taking acetaminophen  paracetamol  for headaches  but nothing else  Good luck   you can do this  Not drinking with you today  Last year I cried myself to sleep  I hated myself  and couldn't breath properly for weeks  I never want to be in that place again  Hopefully 2017 doesn't suck as much as 2016  I'm in a similar place  I feel like I've lost the love of my life and I'm here grinding my gears while they've already moved on  How is it so easy for some people to fall in love  it took me 30 years    The one positive thing I take from it is that I will never not be present again and I will never let things slip away again they way they did  Good luck getting through new year's  Not "I don't get to drink"  but "I don't have to drink" really sat well with me   Happy New Year   I'm going to jump in the ocean in New England tomorrow morning   Right now HOT yoga sounds like the greatest invention ever   By the way I had some people that didn't want to hang out with me after I stopped   But they really weren't friends  it turns out    I'm glad you're here   SD has been the kindest  most encouraging group of people ever since I quit lurking  too   Stopping drinking has turned my life around   Happy new year's Eve  and I will not drink with you today  Did it  Made it through three pubs  two bands  a very disorganised countdown and a semi cautious walk home  Huge huge relief right now  Happy new year guys A little over six months  Longest I've ever had   Lol  That's priceless  Better than me  last time I got out of detox I lasted about an hour  I hope you're right about the way you spend NYE   I'm sober  happy  and surrounded by family while participating in a great group of supportive people that take time out to help perfect strangers   Happy 2017  Wow this is exactly my sister situation  She has been drinking heavily for the last 2 years broke up with her long term fiancee  was recently fired out of a job only after a few months because of drinking  She was seeing a psychologist but quit that and although she admitted once that "she drinks more than normal" I feel she is in overall denial  I also live far and see her 1  2 a year but if she continues this way she may not make it in the next 5   10 years  she is only 32  I'm sticking it at home as well  I fly out of town tomorrow afternoon and am looking forward to waking up with a clear head  and when it's at its worst  not waking up to the fear and anxiety of what may have happened the night before  I have lots of plans and stuff I want to accomplish this coming year  and starting it out on the right foot sounds good to me  Happy New Year to you  It is 100 percent okay to stay in   New Years has already come and gone where I am   Do I regret not going out  Do I regret waking up without a hangover and regrets  No way  It's just one night  It will pass  just like the feelings of sadness loneliness isolation will pass  I'm glad you did decide to post  I don't think it's ridiculous at all  I've been having squirrely thoughts all day  I'm not going to act on them but they are there  Being here and reading everybody's posts helps so much    Thanks  I won't drink with you today  I'm wasn't sober  fuck Thanks man     I am definitely getting there  Been hitting the gym most days of the week  and when I don't I do pullups  pushups  planks and crunches in my bedroom throughout the day to keep from sitting on my ass  Definitely appreciate all of your advice  parts stick with me and I remember our convo when I am thinking about bettering myself  In fact I was thinking about our convo earlier today  so funny that you decided to reply     I think I'll write that phrase down somewhere too   perfect summary   I need to do this so badly  I'm very sorry for your loss   My uncle died last year and I was very grateful to be able to experience it sober   I'll not drink with you  too    This is true  Headed out to get all you can eat crab legs with all the money i would have spent on booze  Congratulations on not drinking   I find that I socialize better when I'm sober  although I was very afraid of that fact   At 4 days I would've been pretty tempted    You might die  It's not likely  but it's possible  I was drinking as much or more than you and though I didn't sleep for a few days and was shaking  like a Polaroid picture  I didn't die  YMMV  of course   I just want to piggyback on the other person because they made great points   The worst part about cravings isn't that they are constantly there  it's that they come in waves and some waves are small ripples and some are massive tsunamis  I tell you this because  in my experience  you need to have a plan for when the bad cravings hit   Keep a pack of gum around  regular or nicotine gum   I used Zonnic that you can get at 7 11  it's so unpleasant to chew that it kind of worked as negative conditioning  or something else to chew on or satisfy the oral fixation  I also used sunflower seeds for this    Be willing to talk about it  tell your wife or friends or coworkers when the cravings are bad  usually they'll give you enough encouragement and support to get you through the craving   And if all else fails  come and post here before you smoke  we'll always be here for you   One thing that helped me after the first few days was telling myself that I never wanted to go through the first 3 days  the first week  the first ten days etc etc again     Good luck  You can do it  I promise you   I also can promise you this from experience  It's 100  worth it    hopefully not too late again but im down   You won't regret it  I won't drink with you tonight  Why did they text that they don't want to talk to you anymore  Your post is so inspiring  Congratulations on two years    That's pretty shitty   I don't have anything else to say   That really sucks   I had pretty bad 'friends'   Of course I never really met them  I let booze do it for me   Turns out it was bad at picking friends   I get to try again sober  and I'll be looking for better qualities in people this time   Here's to a better 2017  Lots of candy tonight y'all I'm in the same boat as you  I can go months without drinking  and having a beer and most of the time I don't even finish it   This entire week has consisted of family parties with my boyfriends and my family and both families like to drink  Then friends come over to my house an we'll drink a bottle or two of wine   Fast forward to this morning after drinking two bottles with my best friend last night  my boyfriend is pissed and thinks i have a problem  and I'm upset because I don't think I have one and I think he's getting angry over nothing    We're supposed to be having a "talk about it" kinda convo right now but now he wont talk to me about anything  so I don't know  Even at 84days i don't think I can handle being around alcohol   Cheers my Sprite Zero to that  Hot yoga  wow  I've always wanted to try that    Have a great time and Happy new year x I remember going through the phase of wanting to "test myself" around booze  In the end I discovered it was just my boozy brain trying to make it that much easier to say fuck it and drink again  This early on you need to make it as hard as possible to drink  Put as much distance between you and the nearest bottle of alcohol as you can  I hope you can work things out with your buddy  Either way have a fantastic and sober new years   Yay  You've got this buddy    More importantly than doing this for a New Years resolution    do this for you    We believe in you   EDIT  do this for you   and your family      Heyyy  I'm sick too  Ulcer related I think  Just gonna watch some rifftrax and drink some chicken broth  Cheers  I think viewing crying as weakness is exactly my problem  I love my parents  but their most common line was "we can't have a productive conversation if you're crying " Which is valid in some ways  if you're blubberingly incoherent  it's worthwhile to calm down  then  talk   But I do think it created a mindset in me that crying is useless pointless and a waste of time  Step 1 might be acknowledging that crying   does   serve a purpose  and sometimes needs to happen in order to be productive   It's definitely a scary statistic  but I agree that many of the people who relapse again and again in the first month  myself twice this year for example  skew those stats  I am fully confident at 62 days that I have a better than 20  chance of making it to a year   And really I'm not worried about that   I just need to make it to bedtime tonight    I'm alone and not drinking  Beats the alternative  I will not drink today   u avelene0186   u Choosethebiggerlife   u Lee in NY   u hexqueen  and  u Possibilitarian2015 Seriously this all brings a tear to my eyes  Did someone cut onions in my apartment   I posted my response at work after an insane cascade of thoughts that occurred from my anxiety  I always have this issue of an intense form of anxiety that occurs when I see my to do list and it takes MANY minutes if not hours to get out of it  How I get out of it is by doing 20 50 motions of lab work  I'm a graduate student   Reddit and facebook and instagram were not helping my anxiety  the amount of posts about suicide  about seeing old friends  about celebrating a year  This was my toughest year  losing a lot of drinking buddies  and definitely getting out of depression   This episode of anxiety didn't go away even after at least 200 motions of lab work  When I came home  I needed to immediately go for a 10 minute run to get out of my head  which is a sure fire technique for me  all thanks to my marathon training  but in the process of changing clothes I gave a cold shoulder to my mom  I went for a run  and was feeling a ton better  but I came home and my mom felt like I was making her feel lonely and deserting her  And when I graduate and get a job I will just forget her and she started crying a lot  It was heartbreaking  Both of us suffering with our own anxieties  our own definitions of loneliness  and our own methods of relieving the intense emotion  I consoled her  as she has for me in the past  but that realization we are both totally different people separated by 20 30 years  and yet we are so similar in our behaviors and tendencies  It was just surreal  I gave her my reasoning for running  it was either that or end our vacation together by yelling and being angry  Fortunately the misunderstanding was resolved but seeing her cry    that was tough   After that I went to my friends home because we agreed to hang out and I was going to open up our friendship  show her my musicianship  teach her some folk dance from my culture  watch some stand up comedians I like  It was about 5 hours worth of hanging out but I felt so comfortable with her and my anxieties were fairly controlled  I come to these messages and my feeling of loneliness is damn near melted away  Thank you everyone  I will post my 365 soon  Thank you  Congratulations on 2 months   Sorry to hear about your mom and your best friend  but great job staying strong   Happy 2017  So happy I resisted and held strong through both Xmas and nye  I'm sure many many here also did so and I am so happy about that   Bring on a bright new year   So happy I resisted and held strong through both Xmas and nye  I'm sure many many here also did so and I am so happy about that   Bring on a bright new year   You're not alone  we are here with you   Congrats  Before this past year my longest was 3 months  Any amount of time is a big deal because it means you aren't using  I can say at about the 8 month mark cravings disappeared  I know it's not like that for everyone but there is hope    If you ever need someone to talk to about it just message me  This has to be the best "scare the nicotine out of you" video out there   I'm with you  fuck New Years Eve   It's amateur hour at the bar  everyone thinks they're going crazy because they had three shots in an hour  I basically had 2 options  and told each one that I was going to the other one so I could just be alone   Drunk as hell right now  listening to music  and enough booze to kill an elephant   Happy New Year  Man   This just reminds me how detox F'ing sucks    So bad   Minutes feel like hours  hours feel like weeks  weeks feel like months   sheesh   Just For Today    I never have to do that again  Thank you for all the motivation  Hearing from you "from the future" is really encouraging  thank you  Ye yeeeeee  Thanks  Feels kinda cool  PM anytime if you'd like to chat  Happy New Year Hey  Could try the chat  it's in the sidebar and pretty busy tonight  I think putting your sobriety first is great  Maybe that was terrible phrasing  My mom was my best friend  Only lost one     Again I highly recommend the reading  I can completely relate to the problems you share and even though you are a woman the book is basically about relationships regardless of gender   Your friend was looking out for you  I'm very glad I don't have to do the drunken fights anymore   I'm in too  but I'm very much enjoying it at the moment   I'm planning on watching a movie as soon as my kids go to bed   If you're lonely  have you checked out the chat   The link is over in the sidebar  Wow   that sounds so hard     what I've realised is that there is no real trick  you just have to sit through the time and tolerate your feelings  there's no magic trick to it    I'm so sorry for what you're going through x What a great way to ring in the new year  SIGN ME UP PLEASE    I was visiting family for the holidays this past week which is why I have not checked in recently  but I'm still here  still clean  and laser focused for 2017  It's still 3 hours before midnight  at least here in the eastern US  so hopefully I can still make it  Thank you so much  u foobarbazblarg for all your hard work in making these challenges a success  Playing WoW  I played for a long time before I started drinking and also played for the 5 years I was a daily drunk   It's amazing how much better you are at a video game when sober  Sober sleep is the absolute best   I love it so much   I too thought I had terrible sleep problems until I quit  and now I'm so much better   I even told my doctor last week not to refill the amitriptyline I took to sleep     That doesn't sound very kind  Pretty damn mean if you ask me   It's not for him  it's for my sister  My question is whether or not her father  whose currently struggling with substance abuse  should be present and actively participate in her intervention  I'm quitting smoking starting today too  and it feels like hell on earth  but I know it's going to be worth it after a few month  Good to know I'm not alone On NYE probably good call to stay in and watch tv  When I think of any point to this holiday other than an excuse for excessive drinking  I draw a blank   Kinda bored  having to remind myself why I quit to begin with  This will be my first sober NYE in 31 years  I can do this  Fuck the zero  Fierce  Stay Strong   Checking in for the final time this month  and for 2016  61 days under my belt  2017  LET'S FUCKING GO    I have to disagree  I think he was trying to be a good friend in his own way  It might not have been what you were looking for but he did have you on his mind  Hopefully you guys can talk about it honestly and see where each of you guys are coming from  I bet you will feel proud of yourself in the morning  Happy new year  I almost forgot that it was New Year's Eve until just now   8pm local time   Amazing how priorities change when you don't plan your life around drinking  I'm happy to say that I won't be drinking tonight  Looking forward to reading your success stories in the hangover free morning  Happy New Year  fellow sobernauts  I will not drink today My own stopping story  I was drinking 1 5L  2x750ml bottles  of wine per night  and often a little more   an extra IPA  or cracking open a third bottle and then saving the remainder for the next night  Obfuscation of my actual drinking volume was an m o  of mine  I "tapered"  if you can call it that  my last night in which I "only" drank 5  high  abv  beers  I then stopped cold turkey  no meds  I was in pretty good shape  regular gym cardio work  and my withdrawal was pretty nasty  sweats  sore muscles  restless sleep  weird diarrhea  etc  Never though was I thinking I wasn't going to make it   The safe advice is to tell you if you are concerned  to see a doctor  You know yourself best  Maybe they won't prescribe you anything  I see this concern in your comments   but maybe they will want to start with observation  I had my wife at home w me that first week to make a call in case anything had gotten sideways  Best wishes  Thank you  I will do some research on this  I'm home alone too  This is my first sober NYE in decades  Home is where it's at     Do it occasionally  only when horny  never in front of a screen    Best of luck  Isn't that the truth  If I don't have enough to get me drunk  why bother  My mom always says "just have one shot"  As if   Yeah  I can see one from my front window too   Oh  and helpfully the off duty police are doing traffic duty guiding cars safely in and out of the 3 largest ones I passed on my way home from the movies   I pray everyone makes it home OK  seeing stuff like that just seems real bad to me anymore  We're here for you That sucks   Not sure what to say that would make it better except that your courage in posting that and staying sober should make you realize you are built of sterner stuff than your "friends"   I will not drink with you today  I did this last year  it took till mid march  For me to finally quit   You're not alone  friend    we are all in this together  Sorry this is your year  No matter which dui it is  it's always our last dui  guaranteed   So yeah  take responsibility  You didn't feel horrible and depressed the other times you drank and drove  Try being sorry for the act itself instead of for getting popped  You'll eventually come across to her as a man ready and able to turn over a brand new leaf if he can just be forgiven  Works well once but doesn't work twice  ime   I read below that you intend on trying some AA meetings  About 1 out of 40 new people take their problem seriously enough to begin doing what they absolutely do not want to do  The other 39 are kidding themselves and wasting everyone's time  You'll soon know which group you're in this time around by your actions or inaction     I'm so so sorry for what you're going through  it makes me so sad and you don't deserve this       Not alone  and it's going to be so worth it   Today is day one for me for the same reason  I couldn't justify putting it off any longer  Best wishes to you   I had to google "Skl" and check the meaning lol    Good call  So worth it  Congratulations  that's an awesome decision   It's certainly made me the best version of myself   Welcome  Midnight has passed here and I smoked my last cigarette at 11 50pm  I've quit many times  twice lasting for almost a year before a sneaky joint led me back down the smokey road  This year I'm going all in   no smoking  drinking or weed  Time to focus 100  on my own well being  I'm excited about the fresh start and confident that we can all kick this    Thanks  I'm super proud of myself for where I'm at in life now  I'm sure you know the feeling too    I'll definitely take you up on that offer sometime     Thanks for being awesome   I have been sober since april  however this holiday season has brought with it major stress and anxiety over the smallest things  I can't seem to quiet my mind  I find myself wishing I could escape to drunk land  I'm not drinking with you tonight  I was scared too  I started exercising in the evenings at the time that I usually was drinking  The first few weeks I ate whatever I wanted  whole bag of chocolate  Sure  I'm not drinking  I read this sub ALOT  I also go to one AA mtg a week  rural area  not a lot of meeting options   I read AA literature and other books on sobriety  I'm still learning what works for me  You will read on here alot to focus on one day at a time  That has helped me immensely  I would freak out at the thought of never drinking again or even this month or this week  But just for today  That I can manage thanks for the recommendation    I probably drank 10 20 drinks a day toward the end  What really was bad was the drinking in the morning   sometimes before the sun even came up   Not drinking today   Going to a fundraiser and my friend offered to stay sober with me   Will head to my sober boyfriend's as soon as we get tired of the drunks   That might even be before midnight    One of the symptoms of alcoholism is an inability to predict with certainty that we won't drink more than planned  This happens to you often enough that you are understandably concerned  You are wise to be "wondering" about your relationship with alcohol    What can I say  Eventually  I   could   predict with certainty that if I took one drink I would undoubtedly drink more than planned  i e  too much  Sometimes  like you  I engaged in unfortunate behavior  After many failed efforts to control my alcohol consumption  I finally got professional help and quit drinking altogether  This  happily  put an end to the  embarrassment  guilt  and shame  I now have a happy life without alcohol    It wasn't "acting out" or any kind of psychological self sabotage  I am an alcoholic  Alcoholism is progressive  It starts  often with incidents like you describe  but it always gets worse    If there is any family history of alcohol abuse it puts us at risk for alcoholism  I don't know if this applies to you  I believe I inherited it from my dad's side of the family  Both my father and grandfather were alcoholics    Thanks for your post   I am home as well  Currently watching some Mickey Clubhouse with my 2 year old son by my side  As many times I have seen this annoying episode  it is still paradise compared to being in a regrettable  rude  smelly  drunken  stupor  Awesome job on one year  What a great New Year's Eve resolution last year that is still here this year   Great job  you   Good for you  A healthy year ahead  I'm forever amazed at the sneakiness of my addiction  Oh and the denial  I'm a gold medalist in that sport    After an 18 year relapse  during which I religiously swapping drugs of choice every three to four years  Proving only to myself that I was clearly not an addict  I found my way back in 2012 and it's been a continued shedding of old ideas    It's wonderful to see you have such clarity on New Years   Fist bump and a hearty bear  hug for you my friend    I'm home alone as well  Watching the X Files with my cat  doing laundry    This is my first NYE alone  and sober  in more than 5 years and I don't mind    We're all going to feel like a billion bucks tomorrow  hang over free  "Closed" meeting just means it is for anyone affected by someone else's drinking  Some meetings are held on holidays   The only reason they might cancel is if the building where they meet is closed    Don't geht me wrong or judge me  I know it sounds assaulting but this type of behavior sounds soooooo familiar I can barely resist to comment  Escaping problems beeing unable to accept your mistakes unable to be responsible Take care   It's all about you not her  Change your way of dealing with shit dry not try to influence change her  I am not affiliated to the book or whatever but it sounds so familiar Just read David Deida   was of the s man  It will Change your relatiinshio if you apply the principles   Wow  That's crazy that cops have to direct traffic  I pray everyone is safe tonight too Math  Reading a lot  lot  lot  Talking to friends  Drinking killed all of it  Happy new year  It will feel great waking up sober Chairs   New Year is 3 hours away from where I'm at  but I'm sure I will not remember shit when it comes around Curled up with my pups also  Yep this is going to be me  Unfortunately the holiday season prooved too tempting    Sigh      I really like this  Hope is a powerful thing  Drinking  Congrats  It sounds like you are doing awesome  Constant self improvement is a great track to be on   I'm someone who looks at this sub daily  but also smoke daily so I don't really have the authority to comment and don't usually   But I just wanted to say thanks for telling your story  I identify with a lot of your struggles and understand the reluctance when you don't like the habit  but like yourself so much more when you're engaging in it    I can say that anything you do while stoned is part of your personality anyway  Weed can't make you a different person  it's just about unlocking these things while sober  Trying not to overdo it will almost inevitably lead to smoking more and more over a long period of time  and you getting further away from being able to do these things while sober    Good luck with your journey   I've done that a few times  It's infuriating  I stuck it in right but still somehow fuck that up  Especially super drunk  What looks right to me is the wrong end of a cigarette  That's really shitty  I'm sorry that happened to you   Nice   But I will not take a sip of any alcohol today  and I will be sure to call him bright and early at 8am tomorrow wishing him a happy new year  and hangover     I've learned that nobody can do it  sobriety  for you  I've learned that I can't do anything about other people's drinking  I've learned my decisions regarding alcohol are not going to change anyone else's views or use  And I've learned a bit about resentments  like calling someone at 8 a m  to wish them a happy hangover    This is a very tough time  Stick it out you won't regret it    Honestly if I need a reminder why I don't drink  I stay at a party late and watch  I've noticed for the most part people get real loud and real dumb    Hang in there Its better than the regular vice  Your username is fantastic  Got a pretty good chuckle out of me  I think quitting drinking was the first step in the road to constant improvement  I hope I never stop learning new things   Congratulations on stopping drinking  Now ask yourself what are you going to START  If your whole life revolved around alcohol  mine did  what with all of the drinking people  places  and activities  then you need to get some sober replacements  I found the support  fellowship  and friends I need in AA    No matter what you do  or where you go realize that you have created a huge vacuum  And as you know  vacuums suck  Go forth and fill that hole with recovery   r REDDITORSINRECOVERY is a good start   NOPE  Freshman year in HS  Got so fucked up that I made an awkward video of my friend professing my love to a certain few crushes  puked on myself  and crawled from one end of the hallway back to the room where the alcohol was when I was shirtless and covered in vomit  I wish I could say something comforting  but all I have to say is that I understand and know your pain all too intimately  This illness wreaks havoc on all we hold dear  It's downright cruel  I also think we are stronger than we give ourselves credit for  From one fighter to another  keep fighting   I'm sorry but what does FOMO mean  Been arrested  not due to alcohol  Rather not have that happen again  No one likes to be the laughing stock of a jail cell After the third relapse    Head shave including eye brows   Your story sounds very familiar  I was a big fan of day drinking  I'd buy a half gallon of cheap vodka  spend all day night drinking alone with my headphones on  Doing who knows what once I'd black out  Wake up drunk  keep drinking  and rinse and repeat  I'd tone it down on work days  or just call in sick  I have no desire to go back to that place    Congrats on your sobriety and happy NYE    High Five for 365                Thanks for the honest sharing in this post  Happy New Year  Pace yourself  It can be done  but only when the not drinking challenge lessens  Agreed 100  How to save a life  the fray  The A team  ed sheran So cool  You look a million times happier  Cheers to another fantastic year  Wow sounds fantastic  You should post more here        Did you end up using your gaming PC now  Just with eveyrything uninstalled  Or did you put it somewhere and use a  new  laptop instead  I am sure with a good mindset I could handle my gaming PC    O oh man  that's great   Im soooo happy for and your son   Also  you have amazing cheekbones    Stay sober and some day you may say this is a good thing that happened   There is nothing so bad that drinking won't make it worse    Sending hugs  365 heh  Congratulations  Well done   Totally   I assumed it was some type of DUI check because I was not speeding  so I wasn't nervous at all    I'm hoping my honesty can reach one person  I lied to myself for so long  Being truthful about my disease is what saved me  You have some shit to deal with   Booze won't help any of it   If you can keep the sobriety going things should start going your way   Good luck Hero  Thank you for this post and congratulations on your accomplishments this year  Thank you all one day at a time My 'light' days were a bottle and a half of wine  My 'heavy' days and weekends were 2 bottles plus some shots or a fifth of vodka  Once I nearly finished a handle of fireball on my own  Once I pop I can't stop   I'm always amazed how much clearer and vibrant the eyes are in these type of posts   Congrats on your new life  You've done an amazing thing  I've been checking into the plug dj channel  and I for one  think this is a capitol idea  I have it on both sides  I've always been cautious but within this past year I've noticed I have incidences like I described probably at least four or five times a year   Lurker here  Home  Viceland in the background  Probing random internet rabbit holes  Opening my 3rd bottle of wine  I fucking blow dried a chicken today before cooking  and it was random but magic for crispy skin  Happy New Year  CA  Chairs  I could go days weeks without drinking  but when I finally did I would drink entirely too much   I got myself involved in a few dangerous situations relatively okay   it was then I decided to quit   The straw that broke the camels back was a bachelor party in las vegas that turned into a 4 day bender   Ended up in the ER and staples in my head after slipping on some water at a pool party   It was bad but I feel fortunate  could have been so much worse  Wow  Happy New Year from QLD  Good on you    That's what happened to me  It sneaks up  I didn't stop  though  and one day I woke up with my hands shaking and withdrawal symptoms   This post gives me the warm fuzzies  thank you  I know exactly how you feel and it is awesome  Congratulations and happy  sober new years   Spent all day cleaning for family visiting tomorrow  had a nice early dinner with my wife  gonna plow thought some frozen yogurt  watch a movie and hit the rack before the madness    Its nice not worrying about what might happen if I was gonna go out and get hammered  You're going to like the way you feel tomorrow   I'm not drinking with you  Staying in with my partner and 3 cats  I forgot to get some kind of sparkling water club soda  but should be fun  Good luck to everyone who is staying sober  YES I MADE IT      So much of what you've written rings true for me  you've characterized that feelining of indeterminate loss very well  I keep wondering  "Is it too late to change the course of my life " I feel like I've lost that opportunity somehow  I think for me the loss is a loss of the future  more doors are closed than open  I am still trying to get to the bottom of these mournful feelings of mine  but they both massive and formless  No matter how I cut it  it's going to be difficult to get my arms around it  I shall  however  persevere      You offer so much to this community  Cookietrousers  Thank you   Happy one year Bday btw  Meh  I'm out of town for work  Worked 11 very long hours  I'm currently soaking in a tub  I'm tired and missing my wife but I'm sober  Woohoo on the weigh in for the end of year and crock pot meal for tomorrow  Win win  Happy new year  It is normal to be anxious at only four days  After abusing my body for years  it took awhile for it to find equilibrium  I was tearful  too  and on an emotional roller coaster  That's one of the reasons why I got lots of support from a therapist and AA  It was easier and more fun to be sober with help   Tonight is my last night smoking  I will not enter 2017 lazy and depressed  I have to get off my ass and get my life together  It feels like nothing brings me pleasure anymore  My neurotransmitters are completely shot   Anyone who's quitting tonight tommorow i'm with you  For the sake of everyone here  we ask that you come back tomorrow when sober before you post or comment again  It's against our rules to ask for people to call you  or solicit outside communication   Absolutely   It's the language of empowerment   "Can't" implies victimization or something outside yourself that creates the decision  "Don't want to" owns your choice   HUGE difference   if it keeps happening or you start pooping black tar  please go  Ask for a social worker  and they will help you find a way to pay for your hospital stay and rehab   Also  as far as your family goes  I hid my problem from mine for years  and I understand how you feel now  The thing is either they already know something is up  or it's only a matter of time before something catastrophic happens and they find out  Don't let that stop you from getting what you need to get better  More often than not  if you're trying to get better before you ruin your relationships  they're generally pretty supportive  Chinese food ordered  Seltzer water bubbling  Godzilla movies queued up  Comfy clothes donned  Happy new year   What do you do  I'm in sales  I don't think I can give up the weed  Some people might not understand  but I can honestly say it has saved me from depression and suicidal thoughts  But smoking cigarettes will be something that will not continue  I hope the best to you in the years to come   Same to ya     Netflix and seltzer is a great combo  Send pictures  I'm a private nurse  My client has a ranch and they go there frequently  When they go  I go    Thank you for the encouraging words  I know it will be hurdle I've never attempted to jump over  but ready to punch it in the face and defeat the cravings  That sucks  Sorry for your troubles  Sometimes I have felt like being sober is the best thing I have going for me   Congrats on 5 days  Hang in there  You're braver than I was at four days  Good luck tonight  have fun but stay strong  It hurts to be excluded   You weren't meant to be there is all   Good job being sober   I don't very invited to party and I'm OK with that   I don't enjoy being around heavy drinking anyhow   Have a good new year   Be proud  Yeah that's true  Some people need to drink to have fun or for other reasons  I don't have to anymore  It's like taking training wheels off a bike  It's really great  I take lots of my own seltzer water with me to parties these days   Enjoy the party sober  I've come to prefer it  At least you should have gotten some good mileage on your eggs   I'm assuming you play Pokemon Go from the Charmander in your picture    Indeed   As I said  devilish thought   My apologies and will delete  Indeed   As I said  devilish thought   My apologies and will delete  Well isn't that interesting  How did you end up doing that  That book and this sub have played a major role in my sobriety  Congrats on making the change  These sorts of posts aren't really appropriate on stopdrinking for a few reasons  One  these posts tend to turn into one up contests  where people will eventually try and top each other in terms of how bad  or what sort of depraved stuff they've done  It's not about comparing bottoms   Two  someone who may be thinking they need to re evaluate their own issues will see these posts and then compare themselves to some of the stuff here  and think 'well ive never shit myself in the middle of a Denny's so i might not have a problem'  and then continue to drink and let things get worse   These types of posts can actually  lengthen  the amount of time someone lurking spends drinking  because they think they're not as bad as X or Y yet  And it doesn't have to be rock bottom for someone to get support for quitting drinking  Happy new year  I will not drink with you  The "242" days  D Thank you for the comment  I don't know a lot of people who have my experience of weed  Most people I know just experience the couch lock and the giggles  They can barely think  let alone work  write and be productive  I don't like getting high with other people so much  They are always easier to smoke another one when I'm really done for the day   Welcome  Thanks sunny qld  Happy new year to you too    congrat's on 48 days    Awesome  You look great  Thank you for sharing your story   Just the kind of thing it's great to hear as the new year rolls in  Have you ever considered doing ERP   I hope you feel better  Also don't worry about missing the holiday  holidays are bullshit  50 50 I'd be done for the day already by now if I had had a drink  We're going to re start Game of Thrones back at the beginning tonight  See a therapist skilled in CBT and consider doing ERP to manage and reduce your compulsive behaviour  This is the only accomplishment I've ever had in life Sorry to hear  I imagine it is hard to be away  We were thinking of going to a big charity event this evening   150 per person for a big surf and turf buffet with open bar  But I realized I don't want to be around a bunch of drunk people at midnight  not to mention having to drive home afterwards with the fear of encountering a drunk driver on the way  So we are staying home and will probably go to bed early   Hopefully you find success in quitting I will not drink with you today  Drink that quart and another and take the day off tomorrow if you can  Happy new year fucker i'm there with you  with the whole about to go to bed thing  didn't mean to come off creepy   seriously debating going on a run tomorrow morning and proposing to the first qt3 14 i see on the trail as someone who i know for a fact doesn't drink  or at least doesn't drink enough to get hungover on the day of days to have a hangover   Not on this sub      Good advice   Here's to an awesome 2017  Can I call you  Hang in there  I am truly sorry  Thank you for your courageous service under these sad circumstances  Stay in touch   I'm going to eat ramen and then off to a movie   Going with a normie friend who doesn't drink   I considered staying in entirely  but I thought doing something that didn't involve alcohol might be better   Thanks everyone for being here  Thanks fappin  you're beautiful   I'm with you on the "1st day of the year" thing  But dont make more excuses to watch even more porn fap  These are the good old days  Holy shit  you're still here and almost have a full year   I remember seeing your early days stories when you first got sober  you posted some before after pictures   Anyway  that's so awesome to see you still here and still sober  Tell us about your uncle if you like   Thanks for the kind words and support  Handle  Hope you're feeling better today  Out with the old  in with the new  Thank you  Thank you  My hope is dwindling  Maybe four  five hospitalizations ago I believed "It'll get better  " but now that almost seems cruel   How much longer can I go on with it screaming in my head  even overanalyzing a hug  shrinking away like it burns even though it's what I want MORE THAN ANYTHING  How many more passing of the seasons will be marked with what the purged Oreo colors  Halloween orange  Christmas red  look like  Will my electrolytes ever not have to be dialed in  Will a non purged meal ever not seem like a flag brandishing victory  How much longer can I take feeling both six and ninety six  but RARELY 26  at the same time  How can I GRIEVE all this  I won't drink with you  Starting the new year sober and cleaning my home as a symbolic gesture of a clean life and beginning  Welcome  we all have the same motivation  to be guilt free and in control again   you got this   Try this quiz   http   www aa org pages en US is aa for you twelve questions only you can answer  It's anonymous  so answer honestly  It should help clarify your thinking about your drinking  Happy New York  Feel better soon  Well  at least you are sober  Congrats  This is not alcohol or drug addiction in the external sense   This is something different from that   Folks that don't go through it won't understand   I hate to say it  but this is likely the first of many instances where it seems like the cravings just get stronger   Perhaps the cravings never cease in their intensity  but your willpower strengthens  and your ability to see that you're better off without    I really appreciate your response  I feel destroyed by this monster that alternates between binge purging and starving  gnawing at me from the inside  It's so ugly and lonely  Lol  nah  I tried playing it when it first came out but it's not much fun in the suburbs unfortunately    Google Fit says I'm more active than 81  of my town though  and I don't even carry my phone at work usually  where I am active almost 100  of the time   So I've got that going for me I guess   Oh wow  Powerful post and right where I am now except it's 6 46pm  The imposter syndrome runs strong in us addicts and that's what I have to remind myself all the time   The statistic that I commonly use in groups is that  on average  a person in recovery relapses seven times   That's not permission to relapse seven times  nor does it mean everyone relapses seven times  some will relapse more times than that  some less  and some never    The purpose of this is to illustrate that relapse happens   In a perfect world it wouldn't  but this is a far from perfect world   The best we can do is try to understand what heightens our own risks for relapse and work to lower those risks for ourselves And we just polished off our HD pint  Happy

questions or concerns   I need to know how blow drying a chicken makes crispy skin a little over three weeks here  I had some anxiety spikes and was worried I'd have nightmares  but so far every dream I've had has been so vivid and wonderful  and it's as if they're all trying to tell me something  and I find much joy and wisdom in picking them apart  Don't worry about it too much  I drank that much if not more and had no serious withdrawals  There were some effects for a few weeks  but nothing that made me even consider seeing a doctor  At worst I had some serious brain fog but that lifted after a couple weeks  Granted everyone is different and I'm no doctor  which if you have any doubts you should see one  It's part of their job to be discreet and honestly they don't give a flying fuck if you're an alcoholic trying to quit  they're just there to help you be healthy    Forget about the drawbacks  let's talk about some of the good things  When was the last time you had real  honest to god sober sleep  For me it had probably been over a decade  Then about 2 weeks sober  around the time  the brain fog lifted  I started sleeping like a baby  Waking up from that sleep was the most satisfying feeling ever  better than any night of drunk partying or one night stands  Then I stopped getting heartburn every day  My stomach started to even out and I could take real poops again  Then there was the weight loss and on and on and on  I know making the choice to quit drinking is scary  but don't let it stop you from getting sober by getting hung up on the bad stuff and start thinking about all of the good that can come from it  Seriously  take some time to write down the pros and cons of sobriety and then the pros and cons of drinking  See how they stack up  Here's what's even better  I'm still discovering new pros for sobriety all the time  things I never even thought of while I was drinking  All I can remember discovering while I was drinking was reasons to quit   Best of luck to you my friend and Happy New Year   WD's yesterday which was shit  shaky as fuck  Pretty good today though  so on the sauce for NYE before sorting out tapering  if anyone's around I'll be there for some time   Cheers Wish I would have read this before dinner   The place did " reasonably authentic Chinese" and was phenomenal   But I got two Asian soft drinks that just didn't work for me   They did have tea there   Shoulda gone that route  Oh my gosh I have this also  My boyfriend is very good in bed so I enjoy that  but some days I just want to cry when he asks me to get naked for him and other days I feel somewhat comfortable   He wants me to do a strip tease for him all the time but there's no way I feel sexy enough to do that  The only way I've dealt with it is by refusing to do anything at times because I feel so uncomfortable  I'm sorry I can't be much help but you're not alone     New Year's Eve  I will complete day 59 sober  No drinking for me tonight  FTZ  Video games I've been a nurse for 18 years  Most of that was working with acutely ill patients  A lot of ventilated patients in long term care  Tragic stuff  really   One day the supply manager mentioned that a friend of hers was an executive secretary for a lady with a sick spouse and looking for a private nurse   That was four years ago  It's definitely been and  interesting  ride  Congratulations  Let's all stay on this sober path together in 2017  Happy NY  If you have my number  go for it   Thank you   I have a lot of hobbies that drinking has interfered with like cycling  mountain biking  long distance running  working out  reading etc  I plan to use those to remind myself what I want to do    After my sober 2 months break I realized that I was social and could come out of my shell if I wanted to w o alcohol    A lot of my friends are seeing they are pretty heavy drinkers  I think a good portion of them  or at least some  will naturally slow down as we enter our 30s and I can have meaningful non drinking events with them   Thank you and happy new years  Despite being surrounded by booze  I will also not drink with you tonight  What an awesome story   You look gorgeous  Well done   I will not drink with you tonight   This is a great thing you're doing  Thanks for the support  Just make sure you don't drink the beer you ashed in  that's the leading cause of Space Aids  Stick up for yourself  It's okay to be selfish about staying sober  remember that  I don't pass up opportunities to suggest this book  I bought an extra copy just to give to someone at some time  Thank you  Thanks  I hope so too  OMG  Yes call me please  Yeah  The small things are getting so enjoyable already  I had a terrible sleep last night too    tossing and turning with no comfort  hot with the blanket on  cold with the blanket off  Wake up and think I haven't been sleeping at all  Yet  I still have more energy today than I normally do when I wake n bake  Thanks for the encouragement  Hey Daisy  I read your post and had to reply right away  First  congrats on the life choice  And I do mean LIFE choice  At this precise moment on new years eve  I sit in bed with my partner lying next to me asleep  Or at least what used to be her  3 years ago when she came back into my life after being absent for like 3 years  she had become a heavy drinker  For 3 years I watched her drink a bottle of Vodka a day  waiting for her to decide to stop  4 months ago  after being hospitalized for 5 days because she couldn't keep any food down and had bloody diareah she was admitted for acute liver failure  pancreatitis  malnutrition  low potassium  and a number of other things  in spite of the doc telling her it would kill her if she drank again  she went home and drank anyway  Only now she switched to wine figuring it wouldn't be as bad as Vodka  That lasted about a week  And then she just stopped  10 days after she stopped   she was still throwing up and unable to eat  But what really concerned me was she was starting to be confused about things  Swearing she had seen and talked to people she had not for example  I started doing some research   Skip to now  Google Wernickes   Korsakoff Syndrome  Because of the way is presents it was not caught right away and because her doctor was a douche it also wasn't treated properly  Now my partner is 36 years old and will have permanent brain damage for the rest of her life  From heavy drinking    Based on what you have said  I strongly suggest that you seek medical assistance with your decision to quit  Detoxing is tremendously painful with alcohol and if you are alone you could have a heart attack or something with no one around  If you don't see a doc then at least recruit a friend  Good luck  You just may have a lot of "stored up" tears then   I have no desire to drink at all tonight  I am exhausted from working all week and today  I only wish I could crawl into bed now but I have 2 hours before I have to pick my daughter up from a party    I'm going to eat cereal and watch crappy movies with my bf til then    I will not drink with you today  Happy new years  Thanks for the support  Stick figures are welcome    My first check in  2017 will be amazing Same to you friend    I'm at home in my easy chair after dinner and maybe about to watch some TV but midnight is 3 hours away and I may need a nap to get there  Stay strong and play the tape through  It won't end with that buzz    Enjoy remembering a fantastic night  I still have yet to watch any GoT  Is it on Netflix  I was thinking about starting The Walking Dead  I think we always watched it on HBO  But I think you can get HBO Go without HBO  Welcome   I used to have the 'post blackout' ritual also   I really  really don't miss that  Take it easy  Congrats on 145  It definitely has with me  at least the anxiety   I'm really sorry   I can see why you're upset about this  I would be  too   Sending you all the internet hugs you can handle  Good job staying strong so far  Keep it up     a million internet hugs and virtual La Croix for you   Hang in there   3 I'm so sorry you are suffering  Kudos to you for not picking up a drink and making the suffering worse   the growing alarm that time was running out  and something bad would happen soon  This was it for me too  Was not a matter of IF  but when  I knew I had to stop drinking    Great share  Thank you  And the eyes definitely have it  Keep working it  Let's crush 2017  I'm not drinking with you tonight  too  Happy new year 18 years  Wow  I'm glad to say that makes me feel a lot better about myself    Yeah  Here's to a productive and successful 2017  Thanks for teaching me humility and some tough lessons 2016    Bear hugs are best when performed heartily   I will not drink for the next 7 hours until I go to bed   It is so hard right now   ERP  What's that   Yup   Some people I know could've had a buzz  then stopped and even sobered up   Not me   That blurring feeling would've ended up with me blacked out and obnoxious  "You're the one choosing not to drink  other people can't make that decision for you "  Exactly  Well said  Thank you for the inspiration  Congratulations on 2 years  Look at you  so productive  That is a good feeling  Joining you in a sober NYE   You  too  Thank you for the reminder and well wishes  Thankfully  I won't be on the roads at all  Just getting my butt kicked board gaming with my partner     Just let it roll off you  What point is there to fretting and arguing with him about it  Either his intentions were good  in which case you should take it as intended  or his intentions were bad  in which case he's not a friend  There's no option but to let it pass by without another thought or worry   I'm about nine days in  I quit drinking beer   That's all it took for me   Happy New Years everyone  Happy new year to you as well  Thank you  Thank you  also for sharing this    I don't know and I don't care anymore  It'll be 2017  I won't bring that baggage into the new year  Awesome  Thanks for sharing  Do you have a history of doing stupid obnoxious drunk stuff around your friend or friends  Agressive  inappropriate  embarrassing  cringe worthy  etc   I have an alcoholic friend and for years he routinely made life difficult at social gatherings  Some people just don't want to deal with that  It sucks  but if that is the case  it's not fair to blame your buddy  It's on you  Good luck  Sorry you're hurt   Good luck  Check in all you want and need to  Good job on being strong  Keep it up   3 You know how to make the two handle trek a little bit lighter  Put majority of one handle in your stomach   Cheers fucker  I know how shitty the jaunt is with heavy booze  just  hope youre not like me and have to do it in the MN winter   Thanks  Congrats on 105    How have you stayed sober 37 days   That's a big deal  Funny how booze can choose people that are keep us from being the better version of ourselves  What's that they say about good intentions    Would recommend to ignore that 2017 nosense new year thing   Dont hang on some dates that sound nice to stop   If u do  u might be in trouble  Playing basketball  I try  thank you for your internet stranger  Yes  Alone  sad and fighting urges to watch porn here too  Let's help each other  We can win this fight  Thank you  So am I    Maybe if you saw yourself drink on video you would gasp  I've got an good alcoholic friend and he is universally regarded by a wide range of friends  associates  and aquaintances as a liability at social gatherings  He isn't shunned  but he isn't invited to some things because of how he can become  You might want to consider the effects you have on other people can really be quite distressing  You sound dismissive of your behavior  I speak from a place of experience  I'm not sure you've accepted the depths of what being an alcoholic can mean for the relationships in your life   Food for thought  I understand your hurt but it might be temporary  Work on yourself and the rest of your life will fall into place  If you stop drinking   Drinking does to some people  Just not me   We're all in this together    I'm trying to make it last me awhile since places will be closed and I'm broke anyway  unfortunately    So no chugging it    This time last year I went all summer pick free  dec  jan and feb  but then uni started again and the stress piled up    you know where this goes    I was so proud of myself but at least I know it's possible Thank you for sharing this  I am relatively new  and I have been trying to practice meditation  too  Kabat Zinn style   I am not crying during meditation  although I agree with everyone one here that it would be okay  Also  I think Kabat Zinn would say that the most important thing is that you are trying it and being consistent  I try to concentrate on my breath and a slogan  or just my HP    I have a surpluss of emotions right now  too  so I identify with what you wrote  I have many tears I haven't shed  but I feel safe enough in meetings that I usually just get a lot of it out then  Are you going to meetings  The wonderful ladies in my Monday meeting are so accepting of my tears and are so loving about it  And through it all  they assure me that I  will  feel better  which is so encouraging to me right now   Thank you and     hugs     for your post  OP  and all who responded to it  That stinks  Feel better   I'll definitely look into that  One trick I used to do is take Benadryl while drinking  It helped sleep  but also seemed to amplify the alcohol effects    Its not quite sustainable cuz tolerance  And it makes you feel even more dehydrated than usual    Wont places be open again on monday   Yeah I should probably go to a psychiatrist   The idea of getting prescribed opiates scares me shitless  And according to autocorrect  shirtless      It really just depends on the meeting  Meetings in my area  SoCal  usually take a group conscience and then just inform our local office in case someone calls to see if it will be there or not  I hope you found one  I am looking forward to mine tomorrow  If one ex smoker can hold out around many people smoking then they have my admiration and respect  Secretly every smoker knows they shouldn't smoke  and I believe anyone would be equally as impressed as I would be  What I'm getting at is your family dig you for being a non smoker  Bathe in their unspoken admiration  absorb their unquantified respect and let it propel you to be that dam non smoker you deserve to be   Every single person on this sub has relapsed  Most have broken streaks longer than that  We're all still here every day  just trying to make it through the day in front of us   You can get back up  Go help someone else  and you'll feel stronger too  Thank you for your service  I'm sorry your people did that to you but you are better than that  We are all here if you need something   I ended up dumping mine too   Don't even want it around  Happy New Year   This is actually a big issue with this expansion  particularly with the way she was playing it  for the gold   this expansion has reintroduced the grind to WoW in a way it has never existed before  unending  Even the very top players in WoW haven't managed to come anywhere close to 'completion' to a point where you can say 'no reason to log on outside of content hours'  and they are getting ready to release MORE  It is actually killing a lot of the game too because its burning people out so fast  the content is fun to an extent but it is life absorbing for any people who plan to try and stay competitive  I'm struggling today  This is a hard night for all of us  and I'm so grateful to have this community to find solace in  Thank you all  I won't drink with you tonight  Wow  that can be tough  My suggestion would be to break the habit of going out with them when they take a smoke break  If they smoke in the house  you may want to avoid their houses for a while   Glad you checked in  and if you're bored and looking to pass time tonight  come join us in the chat  Understood  But even if you accidentally picked up sparkling wine  in my mind  if you stopped drinking it when you realized it  it's not a relapse   That said  I hope you enjoyed your NA sparking cider    Have a great new year  And you   I have an insane tolerance to benadryl  I was thinking earlier I wish I had picked some up anyway but too late now  Oh well    And idk  The liquor laws in SC are much different than in KS and MO  I don't know them yet   I did   Like   why tempt myself  Done  Thanks   I might do just that  Awesome  congrats on a year  I'm not sure of any bucket list things I'll knock out in 2017  but I'm pretty psyched to spend it sober   I've said this before but because you went a month  that means you can  and will  do it again   The key  to restraint for you seems to be not getting too close to the mirror  I think even when we with compulsive skin picking disorder leave our skin alone and get it clear   or at least don't make things worse by messing with it  we are still obsessed with our skin   Then if we don't pick we focus obsessively on the perfect makeup   the perfect skincare   So we are still  obsessed with our skin  but for me from my personal experience  the focus on skin care and makeup leads me back to the mirror which leads to disaster and lapses for me    Because that cycle happened to me repeatedly  I began to think back to the time in my life when I never looked in the mirror   when I was a child   So I thought nothing else has worked  I'll do what I did as a child   just really not bother with it or even think about it   Wash it without looking at it   Lotion cream if skin is dry   put on with cotton ball or washcloth   A  good coverage powder from a distance  lipstick   arrange hair   all from a foot or more from a mirror   Done   Free from thinking about my skin  Don't know if this helps to know but it works for me   Besides I got so damn tired of thinking of  touching constantly  "fixing" my skin and making it worse and worse myself   I figured if I totally ignored my skin  it would probably look a thousand times better than when I was focusing obsessively on my skin and  "perfecting"  make that ruining  it   It certainly couldn't look any worse than I was making it and plus I would gain back the hours of my life I sacrificed to picking   It turned out to be the right choice for me    We had a young man share at a my home group this week  It was like the words hurt him as he said things out loud that he'd never said to anyone before    It took  not only me  but a bunch of us right back to early days of sobriety  A powerful reminder of how far I have come in recovery    I go to meetings to remember  I work with newcomers and service  Service has kept me sober in times when meetings alone might not have been enough   Great choice  I did the same  It feels good  I know I will wake up feeling good and actually enjoy my coffee  Your life is the party when you are up and ready for the day  each and every day  The "partiers" are convalescing from the previous night  i went out a few weeks ago like that and   it's nice to do every now and again to air myself out but people get silly when they drink and it kinda bores me  i went out through meetup com and a few people definitely made the comment that i wasn't drinking  on a pub crawl of all things  oh well  not that i care i am sober and that's all there is to it  i have replaced a lot of that emptiness with running  maybe i will get back into climbing as a scene   i dunno  but the bar club scene is getting kinda old now  any sort of social activity is kinda lubricated with alcohol  art shows  food truck festivals  festivals in general   it's just silly really  drinking is silly and i would rather not be doing such silly things   We definitely care    Sobriety will get you so much further than drinking  especially when life is hard  Minutes by minute  day by day  life will get better   Awesome  I'm really happy that you posted that  thank you  You have perfectly described what I've been feeling myself  I'm sure we all share the same fear of not feeling comfortable with ourselves      I don't get to use booze to mask how I'm feeling  and that goes for the gloomy feelings as well as the good stuff   I agree with you  but the way I think of it is we are choosing to live life without self medicating  We are choosing the hard way  Every morning we wake up and look in the mirror we must remind ourselves that we are making ourselves stronger everyday    The best thing I can do for myself is to exercise and eat well  Do it long enough and you feel unstoppable  Overtime you will feel better and better and feel comfortable exploring new things in life    As for me  I'm still working on feeling comfortable  I turned down a NYE party because of disabling anxiety and worry  But hey  gym in the morning and no work on Monday  So I'll be sure to find something fun to do   you are very gracious and generous  Happy New Year to you   I care   That sucks   As has been said more than once  "there's no situation so bad alcohol won't make it worse"   Sorry that happened to you  Exactly what I'm doing     starting off 2017 fresh and excited for the day  Last year at this time all I wanted to do was get fucked up but now I am so much more engaged in life that I want to go to bed early so I can experience more during the day  https   kiwiirc com client irc snoonet org stopdrinking  Maybe  r legaladvice and r alanon can help too  What a tough spot for your family   Way to go  I completely agree  I always felt so disgusted with myself  I didn't have motivation to really do anything else besides vape and watch Netflix  Luckily I'm 2 weeks without smoking tomorrow  So fucking happy   I was going to say "anything"  but Swedish pancakes with lignonberry sauce are better than anything  It's my third sober NYE  and I want to salute  and send good wishes to all the sobernauts here on SD  We have a lot to celebrate  not the least of which is that we're ringing in the New Year as the masters of our fates  and the captains of our souls  Godspeed  everyone  I still feel like my friends don't want to be around me  It's multiple different groups too  And when I think about it I get really upset because deep down I can't help but blame myself for the isolating  I kind of decided recently that I would just work on myself and not be sad about the fact that they are all still friends and they all make plans and have trips and dinners and party's and game nights and no one even texts me to ask how I'm doing  I always text first which is fine but if I try to talk about getting lunch or make plans they say ok and as it gets close they end up blowing me off  Hurts and I realize I'm not doing something right  Then I'm upset bc I might make someone else feel this way and then I just want to be alone  Or hang out with my mom which I don't really think is totally normal for someone my age  Even my friends who have close families they all have really large groups of friends   Whats the cop going to do   "Sir  have you been drinking tonight "   flashes  r stopdrinking badge  No party invites for me either       Happy new year to you      I wish you peace  prosperity snd a giant side of happiness    Sounds like a great day  I plan to hike to a lighthouse in the morning  That would never happen if I was drinking     That I would wake up from a blackout with consequences I could never fix        Spoken for truth  I've had an odd time these last few weeks while the world agonizes the terrible year of '16 and all the greats who have been lost and in the back of my mind  I'm like "this is the first calendar year and overall  longest  I've been alcohol free in couple decades " Personally 2016 has been a real milestone of zero regrets         Hearty congrats JungFuPDX and I wish you a very happy 2017  I'm curious  what made you quit 2 weeks ago  Digitalism is the soundtrack to this night for me Crossposting is OK  but the OP should say that they crossposted   Otherwise we can end up with duplicate suggestions in the discussions  wasting commenters' time   The ideal is to make one text post  in one sub Reddit  and one link post  in another sub Reddit  which points to the original text post   Makes sense   P S   I see you're fairly new to Reddit   Welcome   Please do turn email comment reply notifications on in your Preferences screen  That's a good idea  I plan to go to homegroup in the morning and then maybe take my dogs out in the afternoon for a hike  Thanks for the good idea   I miss being drunk   but nothing else that goes along with it  Focusing on the absence of the negative instead of the absence of the positive  fun while being drunk  has helped me immensely  Then time passes and it's crazy how much better I feel in general  Oddly enough  ingesting a depressant in large quantities daily makes you   depressed  I feel much better  I'd give it some time   hopefully you will too   Great post   Thank you    Right there with you my friend  I remember thinking the same thing to myself last year  didn't follow through  and wasted away another year getting stoned  Not again    Currently on Day 3  and i'm feeling extremely motivated to keep it up  Good luck to you sir  and happy new year  Please sign me up Hey great job on the 5K   It sounds like a better day night than most anyone else will have   Congratulations on staying sober  Happy TWO years    Please sign me up I used to love drawing  I hadn't drawn in years  Two days ago I went to the art store and got some basic supplies  I drew a few random things and it was so relaxing  I cant wait to do it more  That's no fun   Your city's intergroup hotline is probably answered by volunteers  and maybe you got one who wasn't so nice   You want to look at your city's printable PDF meeting list and find a group which runs an open speaker meeting once a month   May I ask what city you live in  I'm also struggling with Overwatch  it's a game that can be so fun yet so toxic at the same time  I hope that we can both learn how to control our urges to play Overwatch  Best of luck   D I don't understand rock bottom  If you are alive you can always change things  but that's the hard part  For me rock bottom will be the end  no coming back from   Pop by and play some  I'm playing rock right now  but am open    hope you feel better soon x I'm in the St  Louis area  let me know if you find anything  thanks  At least Congratulations on 365 days   Way to go   Good luck to you too  Congrats on 365 days    Beautiful  You are stunning and congrats on your year   Made the decision today too  I gotta get back to reality and not get high to cover up feelings or bad things going on  Everything feels like a chore when im not high and im just ready to stop  Im in there with you man  we got this  Happy new years eve   I'm so excited to start 2017 sober and see how this year pans out   and ACTUALLY REMEBER things that happen    Cheers ing you all with some sparkling juice   Go join your friends  Just don't smoke   That's very empowering      "When someone shows you who they are  believe them the first time "   Maya Angelou       I think 2017 will be your year   It's different for each person  I've gotten clean cold turkey  with suboxxone and now I'm on methadone  CT wasn't as bad the first time bc I was still smoking H and hadn't started shooting an astronomical amount but when I tried it the second time I relapsed I could personally tell it wouldn't work for me  Then I tried subs and got clean again  I only took them for a month so I weaned down quickly  and stayed sober for a bit  The last time I relapsed I tried subs again and they made me feel weird  like my mind and body weren't connected  It took forever to process thoughts and put together sentences and I always felt a little sick no matter how much I upped the dose so I went to methadone  I personally like methadone bc I have a free counselor I can talk to  it's inexpensive plus they have a free program for people who can't afford it and it gives you a sense of routine and discipline   She's probably going to have to do trial and error but I would have a couple subs handy if possible but try cold turkey first  That way if it gets to be too much she can see how she likes the subs   You've made it to the year 2017 OP  I'm proud of you  hang in there man  Thank you   One of the things that brought me here was the fact I was being shunned socially   I was embarrassing to be around in situations involving alcohol   These days I realize I am an introvert and the only thing that brought me to events was the drinking   Which is why I am content sending this from my bed on New Years  I don't think it is extreme  your house  your rules   I don't allow alcohol in my house  they can have it on the back porch  but not inside   Me either     I thank God I got antidepressants that helped me   And i am so glad they are helping you  too   People who have not experienced major long term depression have no comprehension of how painful it is   Here's hoping we keep it in our rear view mirrors  What a wonderful thing to do   I would love to get one December 2017  Another thing to look forward to    Stepping away from a NYE party  low key  family variety  for some inspiration and found it here   Thanks  I know  I have the same concept for accidental drinking  but it's still something I'd really like to avoid   Hope you have a good new year's too  Congratulations  that's awesome  It gets better  Trust me I've heard great things about running from tons of people who were able to "replace" bad habits with it   Thank you so much  Reading kind words about put me in tears right now  I have no interest in drinking and though things are bad  I know they're at least better with sobriety   Thank you  If I can make it through tonight  maybe I can make it through anything   It's good that you're deciding to quit since  as you said  porn adds nothing to life  I wouldn't tell anyone in real life unless it becomes a huge issue and is super hard to quit mainly because it's embarrassing and a lot of people think porn is natural and ok  Try going to the gym or picking up reading or meditating if you're looking for substitutes to stave off boredom  All three of those are great for rewiring your brain as well  Good luck  They usually recommend 12 24 hours but I would wait 24 hours to be completely safe Thank you very much  Congratulations on 18 days  They're the toughest  and you never have to do them again     "the internet"   finally allowing introverts and extroverts to socialize together    That sucks  I'm sorry   I didn't want to be that guy for my son   You've made a great choice   I won't drink with you today  How is the party  OP  Enjoying yourself while still staying strong   Thank you so freaking much  I'm going to attend but I've been to a couple parties and bars and turned down every drink  It's amazing how much that badge really makes a difference and helps keep me accountable    I'll probably be that awkward guy in the corner  But I hurt way too much right now to stay home alone with my thoughts  I really hate myself for letting someone else determine my self worth    Thank you for caring   never  wow you must have been lucky with your travels  last time i went anywhere  my friends had gotten immodium and prescription versions that were stronger just in case I hope that didn't come off as whiny   It is what it is   I'm just glad I quit    This is amazing  Congratulations    Also  I LOVE your hair color in the last photo  Very flattering on you     This is what I did  I just stopped a few days ago because I decided I wouldnt use stopping after New Years as an excuse  If I was gonna do it I was gonna do it right now  No excuses and no waiting  And tonight I'm sober and staying that way and couldn't be happier   Ze lingonberry pancakes  Damn  how did you get arrested   It didn't  trust me   It came off as you being frustrated  which you have every right to be  I'm so sorry  I can relate  28 years old  enough near death experiences and hospitalizations and medical complications to convince me I can't possibly only be a third of the way through a typical lifespan  there's no way I'm going to make it another 50  years  Please know that you don't deserve any of this   3 Take care  I'm so glad I found this community a couple of days ago  This night is the only night every year when I get the most unbearable anxiety and FOMO   I always put such pressure on myself to ring in the new year in an exciting way  I know that this night is just another night and that it really doesn't matter if I go out  but I find it so difficult to just calm down and treat it as a normal evening    That being said  I am doing my best to stay calm this year  I'm staying in with my partner  playing games and watching videos online  It's just another night  and not an excuse to drink   Wishing you all a safe and happy night tonight and a 2017 full of only the best life has to offer  Take care of yourselves  Thank you I know coke used to help me with withdrawal so I would imagine E would help as well  I'd have some xanax or something ready for the comedown though or it will be 10X worse Yeah  i'm starting to think my friends either don't like me or the only thing we had in common was drinking   It is good you see this as the reminder it is  Thanks for posting  It helps me be reminded to stay sober for my son  Good for you  Happy new year  Dude if you have Hulu or if you like to torrent stuff  check out the show Review  It is from Comedy Central  It's one of the funniest shows I've ever seen and the first episode even does a segment on addiction that's fucking hilarious  Man I would while I'm getting ready to head out but all I have is android  Can you do it on a Ps4 that you know of   damn your story and experience sound a like mine  taking itevery 2 3 hours is a nightmare  especially for sleep  i always feel like i'm in withdrawal  hope ya recover  In AA parlance this problem is called "the physical allergy" where the drinker is "powerless" over alcohol    The other factor is "the mental obsession"  where the drinker cannot obstain and continuously returns to drinking  Well done  You have had a busy 18 months    So glad I'm staying home and waking up without a hangover   It's great to hear that NYE 2016 will be a safe and sober night for you  No reason to worry about getting run over or incurring the wrath of a pregnant woman tonight  Enjoy it   Congratulations on your 36 so far   Let me clarify   I was never a depressive drunk  I was always happy  But the following shame spiral and depressant in my system was not helpful for me   Lost my aunt in 2011  Her loss is still felt today  I will not drink as well  Yes  please share more if you'd like  There is only about another 55 minutes left today  but I did not drink and I certainly will not be doing so at this point   I just didn't want to miss out on my check in for today  Happy NYE and 2017 to you all  Alas  I think it is web only  Outside of navigating a ps4 webapp to the right address idk I relate on a lot of these issues  from wanting more than drinking buddy relationships to the post drinking status check  Unfortunately a few nights ago there were some drunken texts  harmless  but embarrassing    I spent the next day in an anxious haze and have found that when I drink lately  crippling anxiety goes along with my hangovers  Not because of anything that happened  although that makes it worse  but because the booze takes such a toll on my body    Anyway  congrats on recognizing that you'd like things to change  we deserve it   From what I can see here in SD there are a lot of people that can relate  it's nice to feel a little less alone  "If I drink I'm out on my ass "   Sounds like a pretty good reason to stay sober  I love black beans btw  Usually with rice and chicken though  My wife is cutting back for 2017   time for me to try again  I started 2016 sober and lasted for 2 5 months  I know with less poison around the house I'll make this stick and am looking forward to a sober LIFE ringing in the New Year  Thank you all here at SD  A few more days and the clouds are going to start breaking and you are going to feel so good    hang in there Ups and downs tonight  but the downs are good  Lots of introspection and gratitude  Staying in tonight   I could probably pull off a sober hour or two out somewhere  but I've done the NYE parties  done the good time friends  done the hangovers and regrets and reruns of the same  I don't know where I go from here or even who I am sometimes because I've spent a great deal of the last 5 years numbing myself most nights   wishing the previous 5 years had turned out differently  What a waste of time it has been  So grateful to be here now  sober and awake   Me too  I took 2 months of drinking   went on vacation drank a bunch as I planned  Then came back and planned to moderate    two weekly later and after a 20 drink night two days ago I decided I simply can't do it  Here I am  Did you drink last new years and then decide Jan 1st to quit  Where I am it isn't new years yet  Just curious   There are sober people in Australia  Right on man  I did not even start to thing about that    cheers on the new year and lotsa water    I really hope it gets better because right now  I'm in hell not only that but sex drive in general and even performance has gone to hell   I embarassed myself terribly with a beautiful woman a few nights ago and i swear its because it was day 12 and my libido is shot    Its turning into the final obstacle for me  I really want to have just a puff or two with sex  but as you know that just keeps it in my life  I'm so happy for you  We made it  The good work continues    I'm in  How long have you quit for  if you don't mind me asking Thank you  I've been trying for ages with nofap  not got further than about 20 days  Finally managed to get over the magic month so it's quite disappointing this happened  I definitely felt more positive while I was abstaining so I want to keep it going   Let's go  Wow  Thank you for sharing  Congratulations on making it one year sober  I'm sure this wasn't easy for you  so take a moment to pat yourself on the back   Wishing you an amazing 2017   I hear you  for me weed is the ultimate scapegoat for all my failures in life   If I stop smoking I'll have to take responsibility myself and not just say someday when i stop smoking    To be honest dude in early sobriety you might get left out of a lot of things    I flip flop between sober and not sober a bit because I constantly fuck up   But I've found it nice to have two circles of friends  It's hard at first  but it helps me    My friends wanna go party and I wanna do something too  I'll hit up my sober pal and we'll watch movies and knit like some motherfuckers  Or I'll hit up someone I've been talking to and see if they want to go on a date  Or just see what my friends I know aren't drinking are up to    It sucks having two separate circles but I can't really let my old buddies go even if they still like to get fucked up  I love em and all that jazz  And I know they're worried about me and sometimes don't want to invite me to some of the more hard throw downs    And I'm coming to really like my sober pals a lot too   Almost as much as I used to like partying and that is saying something    I dunno man  maybe try something like I did   Skating  my family  video editing  making music    But all that shit has been gone for years  I'm basically having to find all new stuff to like   I was a kid in my mid teens then  now I'm in my late 20s  Time for new hobbies anyway  I shouldn't try holding onto the shit I had before  I think My former poisons of choice as well  To me now  Wine doesn't taste as good as sobriety feels  Happy NY  My thoughts are that breaking down and smoking would only add to any holiday depression  not help it You're GORGEOUS  Proud of you too     Your empathy means so much  So often in groups  treatment centers  etc   the other patients are younger or so much "newer" to the system and I feel guilty  a bitter  jaded  cynical  damaged piece of goods  When I'm supposed to be feeling like the world is full of possiblity  y'know  we're in our LATE TWENTIES  man   I'm there in CVS waiting in line for my prescription potassium   Augmenting the pain  to so many people I am a writer  artist  Spanish teacher  sister    If they only knew that I spent 95  of my life either in the grips of or treating  reporting to my team  traveling to treatment  etc   the disease  You know  I went out   to a non drinking gathering  but came home early and now have my two dogs  a 12yr old and a 7 yr old  and am very happy in the bed with them   Happy New Year  may 2017 surprise us all with good things  peace and less displaced and refugee peoples  That is at least ONE worry off the plate right    you are beautiful and i loved your post   the part about your son really hurt  i've done that to my son too  not tonight though   tonight we played board games and hung streamers and drank seltzer and had a real nice time   he's asleep in bed and i have taken care of both of us tonight  something i used to fail at often   thanks for your post and congrats on a sober 2016  No doubt this will be an awesome New Years for you sober  Oddly enough "86" was my first sober NYE  Let's keep racking them up  I won't drink with you tonight   I disagree with that  There comes a point where they are true friends  I quit SWTOR long before I quit gaming altogether but I'm still in a group chat with my guild  Hell  most of them don't even play anymore FWIW I was drinking minimum 2 pints of vodka throughout every day to keep from withdrawing  I had some wine before bed when I was staying at a hotel with my gf one night  and the next morning  nothing  I'm used to waking up with a bottle   At about 11AM I had a seizure and took an ambulance to spend 5 days in the hospital  Acute alcohol withdrawal  Just stay safe  Do what you need to do to remain sober  I know when I quit drinking  my mom who's also an alcoholic but actually went to her first meeting last week   KEPT trying to get me to drink with her  It was horrifying to me   Time to do this  We're glad that you're here and still looking for support  We do have to remove this post  as you admit drinking tonight   From our FAQ   https   www reddit com r stopdrinking wiki index wiki post only while sober        Post only while sober       We recognize that many people spend months "lurking" this subreddit while drinking  You are welcome to read as much as you'd like while not sober  However  for the sake of everyone here  and for the sake of your own recovery  please only post or comment when you're sober  "Sober" means "not currently intoxicated or under the influence in any way " Go to a local tabletop gaming or comic shop  They usually will have open play sessions throughout the week for everything from D D to monopoly It sounds like they are more worried about what you do when you're drunk and didn't want to risk it   I don't think they're trying to babysit you    Just 100  prevent bad things from happening possibly   Sorry for your feels  I know it's rough    But think honestly if it's for the best   I can't wait to celebrate your first anniversary next new years  That's awesome  In the meantime I plan to work on my judgmental  angry tendencies to improve my relationships with my wife and children  Oh  and stop cursing  If I can stop drinking for a year I should be able to tackle these w some focused attention  but it will still be challenging  Same time next year  I quit on Halloween this year   2017 will be my first full year as a non smoker since probably 1991 2   Congrats on quitting and best of luck all you new quitters   lmao Happy New Year   I am also hanging out watching tv and I feel great about it  Can't wait to wake up to a hangover free morning  I'll see you in a year  and hopefully a bunch between now and then  Happy New Years   Marshall I can see why you feel bad  I have had the same issues  I get excluded and don't find out about parties till after  I was told they "didn't want to feel like I was judging them" if they were drinking and I was not  I haven't said a word  but I can tell me being sober bothers them a lot   That's their problem  I won't drink with you tonight  Happy New Year   The New Year will ring in with one week sober for me   I feel great   To a new beginning in 2017     Stay strong and enjoy the pancakes  I'm not drinking w you  I know the feeling  Every time I'm left alone and I know there is alcohol nearby I just want to grab it and drink it all regardless of the shit storm that I would bring upon myself   Wooo     Congrats on two years  I've gone out with friends after I stopped drinking  although not as much   Most people don't seem to care that I'm not drinking   I do find while sober I have much lower tolerance for drunk people though  Reading instead of watching tv   Keep checking in  Hang in there  I wish I stopped at 27  I would have gained 7 years looking back now  But I had to go thru it to get where I'm at now  It's all forward from here  When you wake up you have a new page on a 365 page book   not my quote but read it today somewhere and it stuck with me   I've lost streaks of over two years  It's crushing  but the only way out is forward  and the more I learn about how to dig out  the better it gets     I'm with you  I ate four cookies   but didn't drink  Feels fantastic   Remember the program of recovery is outlined in the first 164 pages of the big book  Meetings are the fellowship with is synonymous with the big book  Try going through the Joe and Charlie big book study    You are 100  welcome in AA meetings  However if you asked me to be your sponsor I wouldn't be able to work steps with you unless you were off of all mood and mind altering substances   Sree pigs in blanket  I know my past with alcohol is bad  but it was the fact that I was trying to make an effort to show the change I'm making that went unnoticed    Being codependent and clingy just annoys people  I've learned    Would that I could spend it on alcohol  I'm 20  Going to inpatient on the 10th  so that'll be good  So with you  I just ate a pound of chicken wings  A  pound      We'd put 4000 calories in alcohol and not blink  And then probably eat 4000 more before bed  At least I would have lol  Least of my worries is food these days  I'm treating myself during these holidays  You should too  Happy new year  Thanks for the laugh  Would being shirtless be so bad  You're in texas right now  must be hot    hugs  if you want to talk feel free to send me a message   I can try to empathize    I know I'm close to the deadline  but I'd like to sign up for 2017  I'm in  Boneless  Or bone in   Indeed    The finish line is in 20 min   A big congratulations to the people who participated and a big congratulations to the people who successfully completed the challenge  Probably getting buried but I just wanted to say that I had a serious drinking problem nobody knew of  drinking a lot and getting blackouts regularly  and I set myself to stop drinking to get my shit together  Here I am on new years eve completely sober after spending a good time with some friends  Just felt like sharing this since I really feel great even though it sounds so ridiculously small  well it's been two hours  I'll check back in later Congrats      Loving all the 1 year posts today  I'll sign up I am sorry  Alcoholism is heartbreaking    The best thing you can do for your brother is to get support and information for yourself  I went to Alanon meetings which helped me cope with the alcoholism of a loved one  Alanon is a support group for friends and family of  alcoholics  See r Alanon    You can talk to your brother  but don't expect him to like what you have to say  Denial is a primary symptom of alcoholism  I cannot control another person's behavior but I can get help for myself  Alanon meetings are almost everywhere   I spent my NYE at home staring at a ceiling  I hope that superstition isn't true  At least if it is true  then that means I'll be sober  I'm feeling pretty weird about being around anyone at all who is drinking  It's like a barrier to connection  I can see the disconnect in the eyes   like no one is home    I had a late lunch with a friend today and a drunk guy there tried to wish us a good new year  He also waved his beer around rudely to ask the waitress for another  It gave me huge anxiety to witness and be addressed by him like that    So grateful I don't have to be that way ever again  Hello and welcome   u HARDKOREbear  If you look in the sidebar of  r alcoholism and scroll near the bottom you will find information about going to your first AA meeting  AA was very helpful to me  It is comforting to be in a room with people who understand and who also want to stop drinking  I'm glad you're here   Oh wow congrats on your one year  I'm ready for a sober 2017  What everyone else said  You'll just have hating yourself on top of the argument  Just have a nice hug forgiveness  I've been where you are a hundred times and try to think of what I  really  want  It's to be happy  connected to those I love  and a good life   Regardless of  what   exactly  it is I really want    cigarettes can't do it  Keep trucking  47 days is  amazing     Depends what your end goal is  If you want a clearer mind and to stop objectifying women  stop watching porn    If you want girls to notice you  stop masturbating   Soory to hear that  BOY does this resenate right now   I'm currently visiting some family  first time traveling since I got sober 15 months ago  and the next time I go down will be when I'm reincarnated into a fucking palm trees   I had a grandpa die of cirrhosis at 74 as well  never met the guy  but my mom told me his drinking got really heavy when her brother was in Vietnam  and he was the only son in the family     Anyways  family can be a salted lemon on a papercut sometimes  and this trip has been a test of love and tolereance for me  Thankfully I'll be flying home Tuesday   Stay strong  good luck  and Happy New Year  i would almost say running turns into an addiction  i went for a 6 mile run in the cold  rain today because i am training for a half marathon  and i guess only because it is running it is ok  if i ran for 6 miles in the rain for any other reason that made me feel kinda good  alcohol  weed  drugs  people would say I have a huge problem that i need to address  but yes  I am very pleased to have this as my "addiction" as opposed to alcohol or drugs  i just wish i could meet more people  and ladies  doing it  I "quit" for about a year but relapsed when I got out of a relationship  Doing it again now and about two weeks in  Kudos for five days  You gave your kids some positive memories tonight  I'm glad you're here  20 47 in L A   a little late checking in   A little sad tonight  but very happy to be sober with you all      xXx Being dead is more boring Absolutely man   Im totally supporting you remotely and your struggle is in my thoughts  even though we are strangers I know to some degree what you are going through and realize how much of a battle it is  I eventually went the sub route and im glad i did   but ive done the cold turkey    I wouldnt think of it strictly as fake bliss  Others may disagree with me but its sounds like you had some legitimately good memories with your sister before and it doesnt matter if you were high  Especially if you werent super intoxicated and nodding  Either way   im sure you are looking forward to seeing your sister and im happy you are going to be able to see her soon   If you are making do without the pharmacy then all the power to you man  Thats awesome  I was pretty dependent on the clonazepam when i came off opiates last so it was a struggle for me  Sounds like you have a handle on things and have an inventory on what you need to do  If you can stay objective and just keep in mind why you need to do this   why you just wont be as happy or fulfilled or able to flourish when constantly chasing an addiction   then you'll mae it through to the other side  I always found the insomnia  lack of energy and the depression the central aspects of wd  The clonidine does make sleep possible by just easing up the rls some  Though if you are sleeping at all already that is a good thing    Anyway   just as one human being to another   I am immensely proud of you and admire your sheer determination and ability to stay calm and rational through this  You sound like a pretty incredible person and I just know your family   friends and significant other are going to love to see how well you will do in the future  Keep going brother   peace and inner strength be with you through these dark   difficult times  Happy New Year and CONGRATS ON DAY 5  Thank you  Happy new years  In October I took a two month break from drinking  tried to moderate and then after an increasingly boozy December I culminated in a 20 drink blackout night  Two days ago I decided I was done  I ran my experiment and accepted the results  My first New Years with zero alcohol since I was probably 12 or 13  I'm looking forward to my new life  Happy new years  Thank you so much  Alanon seems like it will be a really helpful resource  I really wanted to vent to him tonight and express how mad and sad and embarrassed I am  but I don't think anything I have to say will even register while he's this drunk  I feel like I need to say something  even if it's poorly received  bc that would better than just saying nothing at all  I also left my boyfriend on his own  just to stay home and supervise my brother in case he wakes up and wants to try something reckless  And now I feel terrible  like that was the wrong decision too  Apologies for the rant  I just feel like there's no one else to express this to right now   Try not to let it offend you man  Seems to me your friend is trying to help  even if his efforts didn't make you feel good  try to feel good that he cares enough to try  Honestly one of my old buddies invited me to come to a "cheers to the governor party" which is an old drinking game we used to play  I told him no thanks  but even after over 100 days booze free while the party was happening I was wishing I didn't know about it because I wished so so so badly I could go drink and be a normal dude with my friends just for one night  Congrats  I'm not far behind you  First one sober since 1984 for me   Exposure response prevention  ERP  therapy is a type of cognitive behavioural therapy  CBT  used to treat OCD spectrum  and other  disorders  of which CSP is classified in the DSM 5     It could be much worse  You could be Mariah Carey right now  Right  For crispy skin  it's gotta be super dry before hitting oven heat  Otherwise  it'll steam and get soggy  A hair dryer gets rid of the clingy hidden water  and it's faster than patting it with a million kitchen towels that never really work  and who has that many towels  Fuck that   I'm in Definitely online meetings  Well  let's give it a go   I'm in  What an accomplishment  I am thrilled for you  You did great and I think that the way you're thinking about it is so positive  it would be so easy to just let yourself slip back into it  But you aren't letting that happen  because you have the control  Good for you  Good for them  It all helps  Exercise helps a lot  just keep doing it      Taking clonodine will make the sweats go away within 30 min   This is a good place to share  I certainly wouldn't call what you have to say a "rant"  You are upset and worried    Taking care of your adult brother is not your job  One of the things I learned in Alanon was to take better care of myself     Your brother will not likely feel so great in the morning  Talking to someone when they are drunk is  of course  a waste of time  If you decide to talk with him  rather than focus on "you have a problem"  share more how his drinking is affecting your relationship and mention some of his risky behaviors that scare you  Don't be surprised if he turns it back and blames you  Come from a loving place  If you don't think you can do that right now  I'd wait until you aren't so angry  People are more likely to listen when we are calm    I think you'd find Alanon interesting and helpful  Even taking time to browse the subreddit is educational  I'm glad you posted tonight   Stay strong   Welcome to the good life   Day 1 too  we will be okay  It always feels the hardest the first few days  each day will get easier and   can we really continue the way we are  Do we want to  Try remember and don't let your mind manipulate you  you WILL have strong urges to smoke  you WILL feel uncomfortable  Just try hold on  because it WILL pass   Thank you  I see you are asking the same question in many places  She has asked you to give her space  as you mentioned in your comments on  r alcoholism  It doesn't mean you have to go a whole year without sex with her  but it sounds like it is important to you to have sex now and you want to hear that it's ok  in spite of the fact that she already told you  in more ways than one  that she doesn't want to think about it at the present time  She said "I don't know"  Instead of pressuring her  get help for yourself  Alanon meetings are a good place to start  They helped me deal with the alcoholism of a loved one  As a woman  when someone asks how I feel about something  especially sex  it means a lot when they listen   That's some heavy stuff  One theme seemed to be prioritizing alcohol even when it didn't make sense  Good for you to break the cycle   It is both my honor and pleasure to host the first week of the new year  Please join me in making this the best year by not having a drink with me today  Just today  With peace and love to this  the best community on Reddit   F' 2016    iDoneDo Hmm  I haven't heard of it but I'll check it out  I'm always open to any kind

give them the dealers number so you can recall it and delete it in the interm   or tell your dealer your plan and ask them to call you after x amount of time    Also  what  u whatisinmyhead  is spot on  Cravings wax and wane  They will go  In that craving moment   do not still idle  Go out to a mall  meet a non smoker  go to the cinema  join a gym and train etc  just get busy  Try not to stay at home in the early days of quiting  I promise you the cravings get much more easier overtime    I tell myself  nothing bad is going to happen to me if I do not smoke  I am good as I am  I am almost 2 years sober  I still get cravings a couple of times a month    but know   I recieve it  confirm it  and say to myself "Wow  you still around bitch  Interesting    now fuck off you whore"  OR "Hmmm     a weed craving  Interesting  so how long you going to last this time  lets start the clock"   I look at the time and start to browse the web or something   within 1   2 mintues  its gone and after a few hours I rememeber   "Oh fuck  I forgot to time the craving"   then I pat myself on the back and smile   Happy New year   I won't drink today Tonight I regifted a bottle of wine that was given to me for xmas   Bed 10 10 would recommend  I have a similar situation  broke up with a girl so I can focus on myself   this was months ago   I was drinking with friends and alone browsing the internet or watching movies   everynight    I found out recently that she has a new bf and it really hit me   I've been replaced but someone who possibly is "better" than me   This really was a flame under my ass for self improve  She found someone else while I was "working on myself"   I haven't worked out shit for myself   All I see in the mirror is a tired  bloated  red faced guy   That's not the guy that I want to be    I think in this case  it's best to try to flip the script   Self improving yourself and quit drinking and build a better 'you' than you were when she knew you   She will find out your improvements and your newfound confidence   I think being sober can give you an edge and will be a catalyst of good things to come  Sweet  Hang in there  Thank you  Yes it is a blessing to be able to be here with him during his final days  We just want him to know that we're here and that we love him very much  I'm so thankful that I'm sober today  I can honestly say that drinking is the furthest thing from my mind today because of SD  Awesome Whatever it takes  Thanks for the advice   I've lurked r benodiazepines longer than CA  just not very frequently   FWIW  I totally agree  mixing the two is dangerous and stupid   My excuse was to use one to get free of the other   Didn't turn out that way     As for specific benzos  yeah  I actually quit 'tiz CT  went through horrible WD  but didn't have seizures that required hospitalization   Just crazy shakes and an unending LSD like nightmare of a bad trip for 2 weeks   Clonazolam has a vastly longer half life  though  and I actually tapered WAY down with it pretty well   I was at around 200 micrograms a day   But shitty things happened in life  and I started taking more and trying to drink again   You're probably right  diclaepam would be more ideal for a long term taper  it's one I've never actually tried  but I know valium is generally what's prescribed for benzo tapers   but I had success with clonazolam before  I'm hoping I can do it again      Anyway  the advice is appreciated  You're not alone at all  we are all here  I'm watching a movie and checking up on my SD peeps and also not drinking  I'm sorry about what happened to your mother and that you are experiencing the pain of her alcohol abuse  You can gently suggest therapy  It can be very helpful  It is possible that Mom may not even remember that she told you about the abuse   There is little we can do to change other people  especially when it comes to their abusing alcohol  Alanon is a support group for friends and family of alcoholics  See  r Alanon  Meetings are almost everywhere  They helped me cope with the alcoholism of loved ones   Checking in  New Years Resolution quitter here  cold turkey  One failed attempt in November  This time around it'll be easier since I have another person in the household quitting also  hopefully we can motivate one another  Although there is still one more smoker in the house  Midnight struck and I broke the last 6 cigarettes in my pack    Have a happy and safe new year everyone  Best of luck to those quitting tonight  We got this and we can help each other through    If anyone cares to message me when having a bad day or about to fall off the wagon  please do so  Friends who quit together  stay together   Godspeed fellow leaver and happy new year friend   Stay strong  it sucks you're having a rough time but you'll be okay  Awesome on the 5K  You're right  it is possible  When I went without picking before  my mindset was everything  And yeah staying away from the mirror as much as possible is definitely a good idea  I know all too well that for me  inspection leads to touching which almost always leads to a lengthy picking session    It's interesting that you brought up the way you thought as a child  I should try it from that perspective  I mean hell  when I was a kid it was a fight to even get me in the bath because I was so focused on other things like playing and being with friends  Now the amount of time I spend in the bathroom excessively grooming is embarrassing  I think I've known this deep down for a long time  and it seems so damn obvious  but I need to get my priorities straight  And making sure all my pores are cleaned out and my makeup covers all my flaws  or attempts to  should be lower on my list  I know I felt a lot better when I was able to let go and I want that feeling again  This month  I can at least earnestly try and not give up so easily like I usually do   Curry always makes you feel better Congratulations  and Happy New Year  Way to go  Drinking sucks in every way  Easier to think straight sober  pursue what you really want    I still go out  It's different sober  and in a lot of ways its better  But it was fun having a drink  too  But  I didn't usually have a problem out  I would drink heavy when I got back home  Sober is better for me on both counts  to be honest it was more like a year  Faced an eviction due to terrible parentals  plus constant arguments and a bout of homelessness and I just kinda said fuck it  Plus major depression and a lack of giving a shit   Soooo glad to hear   Yoooo  where in door county  Good egg is where it's at There is a twilight zone marathon on TV so that plus the obvious  There is a twilight zone marathon on TV so that plus the obvious  Oh  my god  Me too  I was never so cold as a November December getting clean  And every time I'm cold now  it feels like being sick  Hot baths save me sometimes  Here with you too  New Year's Resolution   Here is to leaving behind so much toxic in my life in 2016  first and foremost alcohol   I won't drink with any of you today   You did nothing wrong  your friend just had a blunt way of telling you he was worried about your comitment to not drink  Its best you got the argument out of the way now then at the party  New Years is overrated  I'm in bed too  Happy 2017   Sounds like a true  thoughtful friend to me    Not drinking today  just kickin' ass  Definitely going to focus on me for a while  I need this  I'm going to come out of this stronger  Thanks  guys  I will not drink today  Those Imperial IPAs  like 8 to 11 per cent alcohol  I always got into them because it's "craft " I was a connoisseur  supporting local breweries  And the scotch  well  I'm an aficionado    Thank you for hosting the first week of 2017   I'm in   I love it when that happens  had it happen to me once at 3am  Lucky for me I was sober  Could have been a horrible night otherwise  Enjoy your hike  and Happy New Year  coherence  memories  health  wealth  friends  love and happiness  One of my goals is to get out of my own head and not overthink things  Did you find that physical activity helps with this  This NYE was a strange one for me 1  being newly sober and 2  apathetic for the first time ever about the holiday  I guess what bothered me was that I wasn't doing what is expected of pretty much everyone tonight  moreso getting an invite from a friend I somewhat fell out with a few months ago to come to her party  We'd already been texting before the invitation came up so I couldn't just ignore the text and pretend I never saw it or something  I ended up just telling her I was sick and thanking her anyway  to which she never responded  probably knowing it was bullshit    I have a lot of reasons to say no  but for my continued well being  sobriety is a priority  I've been regretting all those sloppy nights of just getting wasted and it makes me embarrassed and sick to think about  yet the thought of drinking still had a seductive quality regardless    I'm glad I stayed home  I know I'm not missing out on anything  The combination of being forced to socialize  sloppy drunks  and the temptation to relapse just isn't appealing  I'll take sweatpants  cookies  my fur babies  and Netflix over that noise any day    I'm proud of all of you for staying sober tonight  and I wish you further success and happiness in the new year  Cheers  SD   Easy  Just dont put yourself around it  You got to understand that it is so easy like cigarettes now to normalize it  If you see someone sparking up cool  just walk away from it  Someone asks you just say no  Hardest thing is being around legalization conversations and parties  Actually no the hardest thing is being at a party and its there and a stoner lectures you about the William Randolph Hurst shit and people gang on you  I was around the drug scene for a long time  and now I just prefer not to associate with those types of people  If you put yourself in enough negative situations around drugs cocaine weed shrooms even booze  you will put yourself in trouble eventually  Live is very long and while you can have all the will power in the world having safe places and non smoking friends is a must  I know reddit isn't for religion but joining a church is cool too do be aware you may be judged by it a little harshly but most people will always respect someone trying to better themselves  Your university likely has free counseling services  It's just like therapy  please reach out   I'm also enjoying a lot of snacks and food tonight  but worth it  I'm enjoying ringing in 2017 sober  Your not alone  I started 6 days ago just so that I wouldn't struggle so much with my other resolutions  Goodluck mate  I will not drink today  For any reason good or bad  Strength in numbers   Makes sense  Especially if you think of valuing yourself so highly that you don't want to drink  It's just something that you choose not to do  I graduated a few years ago and it was certainly around but not even close to what it was today  my senior year was 2014 and that was when weed was just starting to become accepted in the public eye  I could only imagine how bad it is in uni now lol   Difference is someone is likely not going to get drunk off one beer  I was a nightly drinker too of 1 2 beers and it did nothing for me  Was it a dependence  Sure  Did it mess my life up  Kind of  But nowhere near as bad as consistently smoking  It is weird but honestly the booze was the easiest thing for me to quit  I just quit buying and at parties I would have 1 and switch to seltzer  I quit that and cigarettes no problems  but pot which was my least favorite vice remains the hardest to quit  Funny how life works  That's awesome  congrats  Hey buddy   Happy new year   Had to take them to the shop   Wheel building is an art   I guess I should have been more specific about the spokes being already installed    i hope you had a nice Christmas  We were in Disney for a week   Weather was great   Came back to cold and windy   Burrrr  Right there with you  I just had a five course meal that consisted of mostly TJ's appetizers and sparkling cider  I don't even want to know how many calories I shoveled into my body  But I didn't drink and had the best NYE I've had since I can remember  Worth  It     hang in there  you are making amazing progress on yourself  7 5 months is a huge accomplishment   hugs  So sorry  A stranger on the Internet is sending you a hug  I will not drink today   FTZ baby    2 hours and 10 mins to midnight here  I will not drink tonight or tomorrow  Wow  so much of this reminds me of my dad  I lived with him most of the last 6 years  I'm now 34   and I kept getting more and more frustrated with being around him every time he drank  The repetition and talking over me or people constantly got under my skin to the point where I would drink more to calm myself down   I moved out a few months ago  and he tried to stop drinking  But he's been an alcoholic longer than I've been alive  and he has just never given it his full commitment  So in less than a week after I left  he was back at it  He kept telling me he'd stopped drinking  But then he would call me  drunk  He kept telling me he's happier than he's ever been  since he started dating his new gf  they started dating as soon as I left  and initially she was a reason he tried to curb his drinking   But as happy as he said he was when he claimed to have stopped drinking for a bit  he just couldn't give up the alcohol  Now he's got blood pressure problems  and I am thinking early stage liver failure  Watching all of that is terrifying  and horrible  and gives me even more resolve to not put myself or the rest of my family through that   Reading stories like yours really helps me feel like I'm not the only one going through this  thanks for posting it  Wishing you a peaceful and happy new year  I will gladly not drink with you     Thank you  Happy new year  I am out and sober and drunk people are kinda annoying and I am tired  There is no proof of that        Seriously tho  you're correct  I know what you're getting at the first week is the worst  it does get much better  Being sick blows  I puked a bunch of bile yesterday  no fun  Feel better dude  Checking in   Went to a get together  everyone drinking  had no desire to do so    success    Same friend always says  I need to drink    Today I got a bit more aggressive with my no    Kratom is very weird man  Wd comes in waves  I'll be maintaining on my taper and feel feel  Then a couple days later I wake up with sweats and akithisia  Didn't happen my first time quitting though  Got better each day  So it's hard to predict  Just know the waves do get better soon  Expect the ups and downs and remain calm  It will calm down soon  And by the way  kratom has a very short half life  but there are some alkaloids that take longer  Perhaps the serotonigenic alkaloids are delayed hence the mental aspect getting worse after a few days  Stay strong buddy  it'll be over before you know it and you'll be happy it was easier than other withdrawals you've already experienced  Well  tonight  you and I have something in common when it comes to feeling alone and just generally feeling crappy about life  All I know is if I drink It'll only make it worse  A lot worse  I will not drink with you tonight  Here's another internet hug  I hope things look up soon   Right on  Happy new year  sobernauts  You should be fine in terms of brain chemistry  but I don't have the background to confirm    In my books   it's a slip  not relapse  you do need to be more careful though  You are in a high risk zone    2nd smoke is a no go  I've been clean for a while now  almost 2 years  and if I get the smallest hint of 2nd smoke I can feel it  cause  sadly  I know the feeling all too well    Hope this helps  and happy new year my dear non stoner  Peace    Awesome  Congratulations   I really hope hit hit a year    thanks for inspiring story  Despite some of the set backs that are out of your control it sounds like you are on a good path  Keep going and keep growing    I'm getting to the point where I don't want to interact with my SO  when she drinks   Her face goes slack and her eyes are dull  it's like her loveable self is gone   I can't believe my children had to deal with us both being like that   Never again   A girlfriend I lost partially due to my heavy drinking and partially due to my increasing involvement in crime   Writing   Not much else that I can think of  Plenty of stuff I enjoyed  and did throughout my drinking career as well but I can take or leave most of it   No chance of recovering the former   I now make my living doing the latter    C'est la vie  Still awake because my drunk neighbors and their shitty karaoke  but I will not drink today  Beautiful  Thank you for the inspiration   Happy sober new year     Thanks to this sub I just completed my first calendar year sober     Here's to one more sober day    i listen to a ton of recovery podcasts  like The Bubble Hour and Recovery Elevator  they have been a game changer in preventing me from having those "what if" moments  I literally listen to several a day as protection from my inner addict when she starts to whisper    Same here  best of luck to ya mr sun  I thought you were gonna say  Actual sex with a person  But yeah  Pancakes with lingonberry is tops   Exactly  That buzz is just a sign that all my responsibilities for the night have now gone out the window and I "need" to order drink number three   I want to but then I get home from work and realize I don't have the motivation to do any of the shit that I want to do so I smoke a bowl instead   Yea  I am actually training for a rhythm and blues themed run in February  Not really going for time either but if I am going to shell out 70 dollars for a race  I had better get my mileage heh  out of it  Eventually I want to do a full marathon  it would be an amazing feat to accomplish in my life if only to train and do it at least once    As for yoga  I have tried to do that stuff  and it is too intense for me  My body does not bend that way anymore   Agreed  Sober me is so insecure and terrified hes gonna do it  Last bender as you know what rough dude   I never knew my shitposting reached such abominable levels    Happy New Years  you fucks  How true this is  I always thought someone would save me if I got bad enough  I blame Disney   happy new year  and with week one under your belt   congrats  Yeah this is true  Sounds like you're going to fit right in around here  I did too but lately everything reminds me of sex Just got off a double  brother  Here's to you  Love how this is tagged Cmon  you're a classic  You are good for staying home concerned about your brother  and yes tomorrow would be a better time to open a dialogue up about his over consumption  He is going to have to want help and I think you should know that no emotional appeal or consequences will sway him if he is in fact an alcoholic in my opinion  Alanon would be as said my first stop   sign me up please  I want to take part in this  Thanks  I was never able to stop picking even though it has been my new year's resolution for years now  So this year I will try "No new scars"  I know I can't stop completely  yet  but I hope it will keep me from picking the same spot over and over again    Good luck to everyone  3   Oh believe me  I'm genuinely happy to see the old comments and posts I can't even remember show up here     Hope yer having a good night   BeClean17 Woohoo  Suck it  2016     I will celebratingly not drink with all my fellow SDers today  Gotta go find me some black eye peas  greens   cornbread to eat today      My condolences to you and yours  I'm not gonna drink with you tonight   Hi   I'm glad you're here  There was a time in my life   not long ago  when I could go for weeks and not talk to a soul if  I didn't go to a store or out for a walk  I spent days not talking to anyone  This was after a breakup   Just want you to know that I get it  Holidays are the worst sometimes  Many times  I  think there is a tendency to measure the whole of my life based on the distorted metric of how a holiday went   But I hear you  and I'm sorry you're in pain  I think it's fine to cry  but I hope that when you're done you will acknowledge your strength and the wonderful gift you have given yourself  I'm sending you a hug  and we may be strangers  but you are not alone  32 days in an incredible accomplishment as well  First one sober for me in 12 years  I could get used to this I wish I had some promising words  but what you do tonight is your choice  We all obviously don't want you to break sobriety  Relationships are ridiculous difficult with the wrong person  I wish you the best  and be smart with your night  You are never truly alone  not anymore   Happy new year SD  Checking in for January 1st and so proud that I made it through the holiday season sober for the first time in many  MANY years  I feel amazing  Bring on 2017   Nintendo  the outdoors  sports  reading  day dreaming     Now that I've got some sober time  I realize it's the same stuff I love now  I've said before sobriety is like learning to be a kid again   I made it through a crowded party surrounded by beer I am so glad I don't have to drink anymore  No drinking for me today  I made it through a crowded party surrounded by beer I am so glad I don't have to drink anymore  No drinking for me today  Not drinking today  Happy new year  I decided to stay in tonight too  A good choice  I'm about to get a great night's sleep   I will not drink today  I made it through 6 hours at a party surrounded by beer and I was not tempted  I am glad to be a non drinker  Still have 3 hours till he New Year and Sunday but I will get in an early pledge   I will not drink today and I hope like hell that I have not touched a drop at this time next year   Thanks SD   Wishing all a good and sober 2017   You have trained your brain to the point where gaming becomes a reflex when the going gets tough  which is a habit you must break now   You certainly hit the nail on the head  And honestly your words are sharp but it is very apt and couldn't have been worded better   My first reaction was disappointment in realizing me having to stay away from streams also  but if it's what is required to make it work  then that my life  has more priority  A lot of unsubscribing but it's for the better  thank you for your response   I appreciate your advice My wife is hammered right now  And was supposed to quit with me last week  So we have been on different wave lengths all night  I know she wishes I was drinking  I probably just remind her that she should be sober also  Misery loves company   Anything going on there now  Like everyone else who commented said  this really resonates with me  I've been drinking and masking for so long that I have no idea who I really am  So    what if this is when I get to decide  as a well informed and now sober adult  what kind of person I  want  to be  It's pretty exciting  to be able to examine what I've got going on inside and tease out the traits that I really like and want to show to the world   You are kind and compassionate  I hope you internalize and know that  Even on a small scale  even if it's just a Reddit outreach  you make the world a kinder place  Errybody needs dat  The first start of the year sober in a long time  I will not drink today  You're very welcome  Just to be clear  my brother didn't commit suicide  at least as best as we can determine   the overdose was accidental   Hey man  I'm youtube com riickshaw  A weedtuber  And this is going to be surprising as fuck to anyone who knows me and sees this  but  me too    I'm medicinal and approved to grow   extract  so I'm not putting the lady down forever  But I am done consuming her for recreation    Write on your hand "your brain's rewiring" every time you want to smoke  look at your hand    Help me  help you  help each other  Happy 2017  every one   If your journey is anything like mine  you are about to get some relief   I believe the worst I experienced was in the first 4 days   Naked Mind as mentioned earlier was huge for me   Started concentrating more on looking forward than thinking about how much I want a drink   Wishing you the best  I pictured a friend's house as you were describing the hippie pad  Also someone in the program  I'm all for expressing spirituality in whatever ways you want  but why is it that when some people get clean  they just have to take it a little too far  I know many people who were raised Christian or Catholic  then suddenly want to be Zen masters when they get into recovery  Again  I'm not aiming to offend anyone  just something I noticed and do find a little silly   Anyway  'grats on the ten months  Some days will be harder to get through than others as I'm sure you've noticed  But each day you don't use is a successful day  I've realized that the more time I get under my belt  the less frequent those shitty days are  Happy New year  You can also put on a mask sheet while you're doing your hair  Helps your skin and you can't pick through it  I like  these ones  https   www amazon com SAEM Natural Facial Sheet Sheets dp B01LYO4Y4K ref sr 1 9 s it s beauty ie UTF8 qid 1483251489 sr 1 9 keywords facial mask sheet  not least because they're cheap but also they smell pretty good  I was driving around a ton tonight and no one would pull me over   I was so hoping for a sobriety checkpoint  Thank you   Thank you  too  Happy Hogmanay  And New Year  too  what the hell  You should visit him early and be really cheerful and loud   "GOOD MORNING  FRIEND   You throw his curtains open at this point and watch him recoil at the light  HOW ARE YA   just to be a dick I just got in from 8 hrs at the bars  Didn't drink  been sober about 15 months  It's great to know your going home safe and you can make smart decisions  Congrats on not drinking tonight    Still playing  but no one else Earlier in this conversation  you wrote     just waiting to die   u LykkeStrom is right   Debt is no fun  but it's better to go into more debt than to sit there waiting to die   You might have some sort of depressive psychological condition     Im in the US not Europe    Support groups  If you have a psychological condition  and know what it is   Support groups can be helpful   In person support groups are one option   Or you could look for a sub Reddit for people with your condition     If you need one on one counselling  You might be able to find a local therapist or marriage and family therapist or psychologist who can help you for cheaper or free   Phone around to various providers and find out who can do this   See  here  https   en wikipedia org wiki Charity care    Or you could try contacting your local family service agency  if there is one   They may not only help children  they may also provide free or cheap counselling for adults too     If you need medications but cannot afford a psychiatrist  You might be able to find a local psychiatrist who can help you for cheap or free   Phone around to various psychiatrists and find out who can do this   See  here  https   en wikipedia org wiki Charity care      If you need medications and can pay for a psychiatrist  Here's a link to some  information  https   en wikipedia org wiki Amwell app  on the Amwell mobile app   In  some US states  https   amwell com cm services online psychiatry    the app lets you see a psychiatrist using videoconferencing   It's probably cheaper to use the app than to pay the full price of an in person visit to a local psychiatrist   They can fax prescriptions to your local pharmacy   Ask the psychiatrist to please include a few refills on your prescription   If possible  ask the psychiatrist to please email a treatment plan to a family doctor of your choosing  maybe then the family doctor can treat you in the future     Paying less for prescriptions  Ask the doctor to prescribe you generic medications  and see GoodRx com to see where you can get the prescribed medications for cheaper     Conclusion  Would any of this work for you  I told myself I'd quit before I turned 26  I turn 26 in a few weeks  It's been a decade of smoking  I need to do this  Got room for one more  Thanks for this   I'm literally having the opposite feeling     Wishing my better half was sober right now    She's certainly more fun sober   Think it clicked to me just now my life is too short to hang out with people that choose to be drunk and not present   Perhaps think of you  Welcome  you are in good company here   Hope to see you around    As an alcoholic  someone who says they like me better drinking is telling me they like me better dead   That is no friend I want   Perhaps they really mean early recovery can be stressful and they don't like me when I'm stressed out   Not wanting to be married to a non drinker is an asinine statement also   There are many good reasons for not drinking like pregnancy  health  recovery  religious beliefs  medications  etc   Best wishes for a better spouse in sobriety  Well here we are in the new year  I spent the night drink free with the wife and kids out to dinner and had a bottle of sparkling grape juice between all of us  Here's to starting the new year on the right foot  Happy new year everyone   It sounds like you really want to quit  so quit  CT it and dump your stash   That's they only way for people like us   For most  the first week or so is the worst  at least the physical part of the WDs   Once you get past that you'll start to see some light at the end of the tunnel     I was doing the same thing   stuck inside all the time  lost my job two years ago  dosing like every couple hours probably   I wasn't even keeping track   I using like 2 kilos a month at the end   All day  all night   Sleeping like 5 hours a night   Taking it just because  for no reason  getting no real effects anymore   The few times I did get the effects I wanted  I ended up chasing it and taking more the next night       Get some supplements  vitamins  etc   Check the side bar wiki and link below   Black seed oil  valerian root  and kava   kava tea   I wasn't really taking them early on  but the first time I took BSO and made a super strong cup of kava tea  I slept like a baby   didn't wake up once   Others swear by BSO here   That was probably the hardest part   not being able to sleep at all  when you're dead tired  and slept like 2 hours in the past 5 days   It is truly maddening      Up till recently  I haven't been clean in over 6 years from stuff   not ONCE for 24 hours   I was terrified that the WD would kill me   I'm still dealing with the mental aspects  but the early days weren't nearly as bad as I thought they were going to be   It goes by quickly       It is new years eve   there isn't a better day to start a new chapter in life   Life is always going to feel like shit when you're trying to quit   There will be lots of ups and downs early on   But it isn't going to get better until you stop   You can do it   Look at it this way too   do it while kratom is here to help you   Imagine how many people will go back down the hole to other things if it is banned   This is your best shot  take it while you can      https   www reddit com r quittingkratom comments 4lfu1t uys supplement guide v1  Thanks for the advice  I did exactly that and had a good time out with the family  We had sparkling grape juice and saw the ball drop   You should try it   I worked a double tonight  and one of my last tables was a loud and drunk crew of rich folks  They really got on my nerves  especially because I'd been hoping to get off before midnight to go kiss this girl I've been talking to when the clock struck  In the long run  none of it matters  my feelings about the people  their actions  the kiss  the New Year  All that matters is that I didn't put a drink in my mouth this evening  other than some kombucha  and can wake up moving towards being a better person  Last year  around this time  I was crying on my kitchen floor after my girlfriend at the time had berated me for being an alcoholic  Now  I'm lying in bed  sore and a little sad  but no longer stuck  Happy to have you all  Happy that I didn't drink with you all today  See you at the check in tomorrow  Peace  Thanks for sharing the advice  I find that after a couple days sober my mind's a lot clearer and I can stick to not smoking We didn't drink for new years  My want to start drinking is when I start dinner so I took the family out and we had sparkling grape juice when the ball dropped  Tomorrow is gonna suck  but I'm home and I will work through the hours   I'm in the same boat  my friend  This week I was told that she feels no passion towards me  and although we enjoy each other's company  and connect on an intellectual level  the physical attraction just isn't there for her     I have been rolling through waves of emotion  battered against the rocks  and I am certain you are feeling the same way  WE ARE NOT ALONE  In this sub we can certainly find someone among the 55 287 readers that can offer us some direct insight based on experience     Baringstraight  we can make it through this without a glass in our hands  It hurts  it sucks  but drinking will only add more problems to the mix     Not drinking with you  tonight  my comrade in arms  Didn't have a drink in 2016  not going to have a drink in 2017   I will not drink today  If he does   let's Kickstart this CA island  I discovered a major difference between sobriety and withdrawal   Withdrawal sucks  sobriety rocks   For me  sobriety was the long term result of much recovery activity   It didn't happen for me in weeks or months   I didn't get through post   acute withdrawal syndrome until after five months and even then didn't know it for a few more   I find significant behavioral changes to be challenging and sometimes painful   The feelings you describe sound like the normal  painful early stages of recovery   Best wishes to you for the patience to give time   time to work its magic  The only people who pressure others into drinking with them are the ones who feel uncomfortable with their own relationship with alcohol  Pressuring a sober alcoholic is a whole other realm of "what the fuck " Good for you for saying no  if it happens again I'd politely but firmly tell them you're never going to be interested and it's unappreciated to keep asking   Good luck  I started my quit attempt a few days ago   i don't really like new years resolutions   but a fresh start to the year is a great idea   I feel you    I'd say try starting by doing it with lights off or blindfold or just back facing him  It's also important that he knows about your insecurity and doesn't be a jerk about it  That is goood Congrats  your hard work is inspiring  and I agree about 2016  I haven't checked in in a while but I wouldn't miss this  Thank you  Just arrived home from a wonderful evening with friends and will hit the pillow completely sober  WE do have this  May 2017 be a fantastic one for you  Getting healthier is so much easier with a clear mind  I personally said fuck tobacco juices  I want fruit as fuck flavors  because why not  Some people do  but it's typically older people that have been smoking for decades Literally waht im doing tonight  No weed bc i cant stand the stuff  but i did eat today  so thats a win or something  should polish off this 30 pack in 2 hrs or so This is really impressive and inspiring  I have a friend who's pushing me to 'taper instead of going cold turkey' i e  smoke with him  Really amazing that you managed to say no  repeatedly  with your  partner   so much strength  great work  Louis Rossman made a video about his theory on why this happens   He said that he was never punished growing up  he said that when he did something bad  his dad would make him go sit in the study  and would then talk to him and explain why the thing he did was wrong  He then went on to say that parents just ground their kids or punish them  but that doesn't really teach them anything  and then once they're off on their own for the first time  they go crazy  because they were never pushed to think beyond the punishment  and now there's no one there to ground them anymore   Not sure if that's really true or not  but the post reminded me of it   I nearly posted a group chat for the drinking alone crew  Now I regret it  Hi  Tom  I'm glad that you haven't given up  and that you're still determined to get sober  I really admire that  I know you're probably feeling frustrated right now  but try not to beat yourself up about this  Pretty much all that does is make you feel worse  and it can make the urge to drink again that much stronger  Instead  maybe consider this a learning experience  If everyone could absolutely quit drinking the very first time they set out to  there would be no alcoholics  I doubt any one of us would even still be here  But you have a lot of wonderful people here in this sub who know what you're going through  and want to help you succeed      When I get frustrated  I remind myself again and again  to take sobriety a day at a time  I just focus on today  and worry about tomorrow when it gets here  And today  I will not drink with you  my friend  You can do this     Day 1 for me but not drinking today Are you quitting all of that cold turkey  This is my song for the new year https   www youtube com watch v 1XHhf06I ds O well I'm in bros   Is there a guide to make withdrawals tolerable  This was very interesting  Thank you  Fash  I'm surprised Urethra was so low considering he had the most meme'd phrase of the year  I was also surpised 03 15 was so high considering he has been absent for the latter half of the year  The top commenters  however  seem to represent contributions to CA proportionally    Happy new beers  everyone  Last night was my last drink    I'm joining this club because you guys and gals make me wanna feel what being sober is again   Happy New Year   I'm home alone and have no friends  to  party with   But I have a bottle of champagne  half a handle of whiskey and Netflix   Cheers  IMO  this expansion has caused a lot of people to quit and burnout because if anything  it's the most "WoW" expansion to date  Tons of people claim it's the best expansion to date  but they aren't even playing it anymore   It's thrown out a ton of content  dungeons  raids  repeatable daily quests  and sure that seems like a godsend after Draenor since there's a lot more progression  but none of it's that different  meaningful  engaging  or particularly innovative in terms of how the game has evolved  You spend a majority of time grinding out tons and tons of resources for meager power gains to do what  Faceroll dungeons or clear difficulties with uncoordinated groups   It's the same WoW we've been playing for 12 years   I feel ya man  My heart really does go out to you and I hope and pray for you and all of us tonight  We got this  Failed miserably made it through most of today and bought some gum  family vacation is in 2 days and I'm not about to ruin it due to the way I act during withdrawal  I'm currently  we rotate out  DJing at the party that made me stop drinking this past Halloween   I'm sober  but all my friends are wasted   This def isn't easy right now and I wish I could be more social   I really wish people would stop asking me where they can find drugs   The only reason I do this is because I love the music and making people dance  but fuck this is hard   We have people staying w us as well that will probably want to party at our house after this is done    Had a slight case of FOMO earlier  but now that I didn't drink I feel amazing  Thank you all for not drinking with me tonight  Happy New Year   And I cannot wait for the day I can be totally comfortable and happy in a drinking atmosphere while being sober   Thanks for giving me something to strive towards   I went out tonight  My boyfriend and I had dinner with two of my close friends  then we went to a party  Honestly  I was miserable the first hour of the party    I was very tempted to drink  But I didn't  and I didn't let myself go home  and I ended up having a blast  I danced for the first time in years and I've decided I'm going to take some lessons in the next few months  I left at 12 05 lol  so sleepy  and drove my boyfriend and I home safely   Feeling pretty damn good  South Island  I'm doing the heaphy  Kepler and routeburn track  And some smaller hikes in between  If everything works out      Where are you located   Happy first sober day of 2017  I'm not drinking today   Well good on you for defending your sobriety today by posting  I know that early on it can suck sometimes  Just know that if you stick with it one day at a time you will begin to feel much better and stuff will start to work itself out   I had the same issue  My longest sober streak this year had been  48 hours  I had to go motherfucking 54 hours sober for kkkristmas   My gf's family is apparently so ravished by drug abuse that they do a dry christmas  yeah  that's a thing  My own family's typical supply of alcohol was disrupted by my perceived "drinking problem" and my sister's fiance's puritanical values  I seriously despise the kid  but that's a story for another time    Happy CA Christmas to you  when all our familial obligations are exhausted  all the inlaws are back where they belong  and we can comfortably drink ourselves into oblivion   Oh it's the most wonderful time of the yearrrrrrrr  I will not drink today   Happy new year  here's to a better life  Happy New Year   I purchased The 30 Day Sobriety Solution on your recommendation   I start reading and my first "lesson" tomorrow   Hope it does for me what it seems to have done for you   My ex would watch this video over and over again  https   youtu be 1zeZhHq0WtY  Or if he had a craving he would just go outside and watch 5 minutes of it and come back to where he left off later  Good luck Shit like this is why I'm paranoid all the time  Well at least they didn't take your phone  pretty considerate  You too  I see you got there yourself not too long ago   my brother and I have just confronted my mother who is having the exact same problem  exercising at minimum an hour per day  she walks anywhere from 2 5 miles per day and sees a personal trainer a few times per week  goes to yoga once a week   In addition to her social drinking  drinks herself to sleep at night  often going to the fridge multiple times to refill her glass of wine after she has already tried to go to bed  How have you been able to combat the problem in other ways  or do you have any suggestions for how we can help her  4 days here   It's my number one new years resolution   I tried to quit on Christmas Eve and ended up smoking on Christmas   Usually when I fall off the nicotine wagon I give up quitting   not this time  A huge congratulations and a sparkling water toast  You're an inspiration to me  The biggest difference is that there is no end to it this time  even in Vanilla there was a point you could get to where you didn't need to grind endlessly though it was hard to reach  in Legion there isn't a single person that can say they don't need to get on for anything anymore  when you need over 50 million AP just for a single maxed weapon and titanforging makes it impossible to have the best gear you just can't stop  I've played WoW at a competitive level for years and I've never seen so many people quitting  even in WoD people were staying for at least the first part of it  Legion has a huge amount of great ideas but they implemented so many of them horrendously  i e  Legendaries are a good idea on paper but they picked up the idea and lost it along the way creating this shit system of 'get lucky or quit the game'   I find it interesting how some alcoholics will say they don't want to go to AA because it's embarrassing  Is that more embarrassing than stumbling home from the bar on the regular    7    They like me  They really like me   Either that or I'm just a shit show  I'll take either one  Thanks  I'm getting there  this is probably the first round of antibiotics I've taken in 5  years that I haven't consumed alcohol on  so I'm hoping my recovery time will be faster lol Thank you for your words  It really helps a lot  I was drinking more than a pint and often a liter of vodka every night near the end  You say up to 12 a night  What's typical   I did a taper down rather than cold turkey  I can only saw what I did  not really qualified to give medical advice  I basically did "halves"  So after a 1 liter night I did 1 pint the next night  Then I did a half pint  Etc down until only one beer  Then I stopped and haven't looked back    Pros  it's not as big of a shock on the system  I was less anxious  still like 7 10 on the scale at first though   Cons   you still drink  In my case I only procured exactly what I intended to drink  As most of us know it's really easy to just have "a little more" once we've started  The it spirals out of control    If you have someone that can help you taper  they control the alcohol  then it may be do able   thank you for sharing  you look amazing   lots of great stuff here    Purim seems like so much fun  fuck  It has the dressing up part of halloween but with more of an emphasis on getting fucked up  I can dig it   What was the thing you moderated  I  for one  am curious  Fuck  you know we love you   quitting is easy  staying quit is whats hard  because for me if its  not the craving that never goes away  its the health anxiety        Just soldier through it  My wife runs events and it's her job to host a big 300 person   NYE party  I'm proud of her and attending to support her  But I'm only drinking Coke  no La Croix in stock   Not drinking today and so happy to be in such fine company  Considering you're all a bunch of filthy animals I could still be a shit show  Call the member services number on the back of her Medicare card  of access her patient portal online  They will have resources for you  You can google "your state  Medicare substance abuse treatment" as well  It may be a bit tougher on the holiday weekend  but there is bound to be somewhere  Detox will probably be necessary first  so be sure to look into that as well  I do admissions for a treatment center  so let me know if you have any other questions    There are admissions processes and protocols that facilities have to follow if they are state licensed to bill Medicare  Some of these may be the things causing timing issues for you  It is going to be part of the process anywhere reputable that you contact   Id like to thank the academy  for the shakes  The three trips to the ER  Super props to the academy for getting the chick from psych to fuck me in Florida    Special shout out to Scotch  And let's hear it for homelessness    And finally   If it wasn't for Brenda I'd have never made it here    Thanks you fucking worthless fucking cunt   honestly the more times you relapse the more experience you get at actual quitting  if this helps  I'll tell you this  I bet they noticed  especially the kids  But here's the thing  people won't comment on a positive difference  I bet they think you're extra sociable and happy  a product of being sober  but think it's because of alcohol  Revel in this moment because it proves  as you said  you don't need alcohol  Honestly  fuck that Shit  Merry new years   Can I still sign up  For me it's been a path of rediscovery  rediscovering my hobbies and finding new ones  projects with wood  drawing  reading  learning  helping   I also have a toddler and pregnant wife so filling free time isn't too much of a problem lol  I wouldn't mind it being more of a problem actually  Already lawyered up and gearing up for court  I'm looking at 6 months probation  some community service  drug classes  and if I do everything right than I won't have a conviction on my record since it's my first criminal charge  the worst part of this whole thing is how expensive it all is  Lawyer is  750  than I have to pay for court fees and the drug tests and drug classes  On top of that I have to take time off from work to do community service  It's a struggle but I'm trying to stay positive  Sure  I wish to Christ I could feel filthy again    Time to fuck a whore on a Sunday morning   A lot of good people to talk you through it here   Need a taper plan   No problem   Need help with WD symptoms   Just ask  I won't drink today with the rest of you awesome people   I just got home from my SO's NYE party  Arrived at 9  left at 2  and didn't have a drop to drink  When I made the choice to become sober this November  NYE was the night I worried about most  I'm so proud to have made it here  Can't wait to ring in the New Year tomorrow morning with energy  clarity  and GOOD vibes  Happy New Year everyone  I will not drink with you in 2017  So excited to wake up tomorrow and welcome the first day of 2017 without a brutal hangover  So proud to be here with all of you  I will not drink today  Happy New Year  SD           Thx everyone  To be honest  I was actually reminiscing about the unspeakable shortly after posting that  but sharing the burden with y'all really helped me keep my focus  I love how refreshing it is to be free  Macgregor is poison  I always take statistics with a grain of salt  I dont know how to word this but do people who don't relapse seek less help making it biased  I e  they see the people returning to groups or therapy but not the ones who make it on their own  Thanks for your support  Just got home and I stuck to my guns  Got to be the dd for a few extra friends who were very greatful  Also saw a girl get carried out of the bar and taken away in an ambulance covered in her own vomit  It's definitely an interesting experience just watching a bunch of people get hammered and being able to really notice the difference in how they act as the night goes on  Here's to day 4 of many more  cheers Sorry  Wasn't sure if everyone would be notified if I just posted it as another comment     I mostly lurk  Congrats and seltzer cheers to you  Here's hoping for a less turbulent 2017     Congrats  what a great feeling that must be      and such a perfect start to the year  yay  We're in the middle of summer at the moment  Damn aussies haha  we had a 42c day this week   way hot lol  But yes  I'll have to get back into the gym  being fat sucks    It feels so good doesn't it  So pure and so powerful  Congrats to you honey and your family  Happy NY  Happy New Years guys   Last New Years my first sober  was awful  I was angry  sad  alone  But if I hadn't gotten through that  I wouldn't be where I am today  It gets better   Good work dude  Was the predominant problem in my mixed bag of a drug problem  very glad to be rid of it  At 43  I think I can handle being around alcohol  but I have no idea about being around drinking  There's always going to be somebody who offers  maybe they're drunk and forgot you don't drink  maybe they're a stranger and never knew  but saying no to actual alcohol actually being handed to me is exactly where I failed last time I did   First sober NY in over 10 years  I will not drink with you today    Lol Wow  two years  congratulations  Kinda cool too that you have a good "anniversary" date    way easy to evaluate the changes    Since you asked  p  writing is something I've been wanting to get back into for a long time  I'm around 8 months so still working on myself but I like how you put it  that it's more within reach now that I've been sober for a little while  Would have been impossible when I drank  so it's closer  but still seems challenging  Hopefully next New Years I will check in to say I've made progress  Thanks for the great post   I will not drink today  I was attended at AA party but things got a little heatened up  I was invited by a friend who asked me to hang out with him  It ended up that he didn't know where the event was  I show him the way and got a bit upset because I'm recently reclused from social media because I became to hate that world and had to defecate one important girl at the same time  There was things I didn't want to see or know in social media  So when we got there   he just hanged out with another ex rehability center guys and I was alone  I listened to Alice in chains and wondered why people tend to be happy and hug each other  I was ghost  I was drinking water and then I just threw the cup away with water and bailed in intense mood  I left for AA saturday night group but one of my AA friends noticed and followed me  Then we just chatted and laugh  We ordered pizza in group and I told everything   Hang in there  Just keep pursuing activities and habits that nurture you and continue to put yourself out there  The friends will come  I'm in a similar boat myself so I feel you  You can do this  Good vibes to you and a very happy new year   For the next couple of

flannel jammies   they're the BEST  that sounds so strange    why is your drinking so important to him   Have an appointment with my primary care provider Tuesday  I'm going to bring it up   I changed doctors in November  and had my first appointment with her in December  Tuesday's appointment is to follow up on bloodwork  and to probably lower my blood pressure medications   The ER doctor did suggest I bring up getting something stronger than SSRIs to deal with my anxiety  tried them before  didn't work well  couldn't take as needed  and the withdrawal sucks when you quit    Buspar seems to be something that someone with an addictive personality can take  it's not addictive  it's not a benzo  doesn't seem to have a high  and can be taken as needed  I'm going to discuss that with her  It's also on my insurance company's formulary as a generic   I felt completely normal when I woke up today   had 1mg ativan at the hospital  which is nothing for someone in WD  she wanted to see if it was a panic attack or full blown withdrawal before hitting me with a higher dose   which calmed me right the fuck down  She gave me a small script for librium  I took 2 last night  and felt completely fine when I woke up today   There's definitely some withdrawal going on   I've had 2 librium during the day  25mg each  last one was around 4pm   and a couple of beers a little while ago   I'm a little jittery  but nothing close to DT's  and got through a dinner shift just fine  If it was bad enough that I was going into DTs  I would have blown through the entire bottle of librium already   ER doc chalked it up to worrying myself into a severe panic attack  based on my response to a low dose of Ativan  calmed me right the fuck down and brought my blood pressure to sane levels  and it didn't go up in the  3 hours I was there  and my BAC at the time my blood was drawn  I don't have it on any paperwork handy  but she said it was pretty high    Plus said my liver numbers would have been a hell of a lot worse than they were if I was drinking enough to get into that kind of shape  I've had panic attacks before  but never one I couldn't recognize as a panic attack and manage to talk myself down from  But I'm prone to anxiety anyway  The official diagnosis on the discharge paperwork was general anxiety disorder  which I've been trying to get for years out of my primary care doctors  At least I have it on paper now  Woo  Made it through December 30th and 31st sober  on to 2017  I will not drink with any of you today   I was counting how many happy new years I got too then realized I hadn't sent any  time to give  Thanks so much    That's effectively what I want to  and you're right  I'm not going to get that by smoking  So thanks very much  Happy New Year   As in  you have days where you don't count calories  restrict  over exercise  purge  ect    The past couple of days  from christmas until right before today  I've found myself able to eat somewhat normal  No counting cals  over excerising  or having the urge to purge  It's slowly going back to my normal behavior but does anybody else ever get this  That's definitely a little harsh and inconsiderate  Congrats on 8 days Welcome u Fandeathrickets  Stopping drinking was one of the best decisions I ever made  Realising that I didn't ever have to feel like that again was liberating   Hope you're feeling better soon    I'll support this 100   Every time I've gotten past the first week and relapsed  it was some situation where the alcohol was right in front of me  and I ended up reaching out and grabbing it  Sometimes this was in the store  just decided to pick up a sixer while I was there  others it was at a party and I figured "fuck it" the second or third or whatever time saying no  or even friends who didn't understand inviting me to indulge a bit  One time was my 21st birthday and figuring I should take advantage  That was really fun because when I got home  I puked on the stairs and carpet and my mom made me clean it the hard way  right there and then  Somehow  it took me another year and 10 months to figure out that the first drink is the most important to forego  because weakness of will is always there  waiting for any opportunity  from a birthday  to a drunken insult  to a pretty girl  anything that will get us to take that first sip  It's good to be around friends  hurtful not to be invited  but ultimately  always a risk  in my experience  The most important thing I've learned in my life is that we should never assume that anybody else understands what is going on in our heads  As alcoholics  as people who suffer from depression  as men  or women  children  or adults  whoever you are  people will be different from you  and expecting them to fully understand is the only surefire way to get hurt by them  Since they are going to require you to attend AA anyway  why not check it out now  Better to want to go  make friends and learn how to stay sober than be forced to go and be miserable the whole time like I was  It's uncanny    Come into work a little still drunk  "boracha " Fuck  I haven't even said hola yet   Happy New Year and congratulations on your sober trip around the sun  Happy New Year everybody  I will not drink with you all today  Well i never was someone who sits hours before porn just the time to get off but i still saw the negative effects and stoped I'm so proud of you u throwsterrip  The 'firsts' can be tough  As u billbrasky87 said  it does get easier as sobriety becomes the norm   Congratulations on putting yourself first  Looking forward to seeing your "3" star  I have to agree with you  My mother  who abhors recreational drinking  offered me a bottle of chocolate red wine she got from a coworker  She couldn't drink if she wanted  and only approves of me drinking very moderately at holiday parties  And yet  she asked if I was sure when I turned the wine down  She's never been anything less than loving  People just don't understand feelings they've never experienced  so people who aren't alcoholics can't understand what it's like to be one  Expecting people to  for me  ironically led to most of my drinking  Drink moar  propose less   Marry the liquor  til death do ya part    What could go wrong   I would point out that a good friend to an alcoholic would feel like utter shit if that alcoholic friend relapsed at a party said former friend had hosted  I get your perspective  but you should try to see it from his too  That is quite funny   Happy New Year SB  Got stopped by cop  cop saw my friend had a shit ton of acid  Car gets searched and cop finds weed  Charges my friend with a felony and possession of marijuana  I just got charged with possession of marijuana  Basically a series of dumb decisions on my part got me busted  Good luck  Wish you all the best   I had my last joint on Thursday the  29th  Let's kick this habit together    The doctor didn't think it was severe withdrawal  and didn't note anything about alcohol on my discharge paperwork  only a panic attack  but did include some resources about rehab   Also  1mg of ativan calmed me right the fuck down  and kept me calm  whereas it usually takes at least 4 6mg for me if I've gotten into severe withdrawal  She did give me some librium to take home at least  When I asked how much ativan she had given me  she said only 1mg  to see if it calmed me down  1mg isn't enough someone close to DTs   and also said my blood pressure wasn't nearly high enough to be into withdrawal even before the ativan  and stayed low enough while there that she felt she could rule out anything close to DTs  I mentioned I'd felt like this for several days  she theorized that I've been so worried that I worried myself into a major panic attack  I'm prone to anxiety anyway  but I've never had a panic attack that bad  My blood pressure was also completely normal after 1mg   104 59 at discharge  which was a few hours after I got there  If I was as far into withdrawal as I thought I was  it would have been at least 160 within an hour of the initial dose  in my past experiences   I'm definitely jittery today  and my blood pressure is on the higher side   140 90  though I haven't taken my clonidine today   so there is SOME withdrawal going on  but don't feel like DTs  I've had 50mg of librium  one a bit after waking up  one around 4pm   which took the edge off  and this evening I had a few beers  but nowhere near my usual amount  If I was into bad withdrawal  I would have blown through the entire bottle already  she gave me 12 x 25mg   and suggested I talk to my PCP about something for anxiety stronger than an SSRI  and also consider naltrexone again to deal with the alcohol cravings   Typical at home detox I've had with librium has been 40 x 25mg over 10 days  with the first couple of days being very heavy and obviously no driving allowed until the last day or two   so the 50mg I've had today would have been nowhere near enough to get through even a few hours  I would have gone through most  if not all  of the bottle already if I was as far down the hole as I thought I was  Nice  Yeah  most of my friends slowed down in their mid twenties but I continued right along  I finally quit at 29 and now we do all sorts of stuff together  sometimes with them having a drink or two  sometimes not having anything  The outdoor stuff is great  In the last year one of my friends and I took up caving which has been awesome  and it's a good example of something I never would have been able to do back when I was drinking   Good for you  I was asleep well before midnight myself    Just spent a lovely evening watching the new Star Wars movie  No drinking for me  On the way home saw a wreck  One car smashed in the road and another on its side in someone's lawn  Cops were doing what looked like a sobriety test on a guy as I drove past  That could have been me on any one of hundreds of nights    Also  no drinking for me today either  Good night all   Thank you  and wishing you  and everyone here   one of the most amazing places I've ever been   a fantastic 2017 I got to a year one day at a time  I'm closing in on two  but that doesn't matter  What matters is today  and today I did not drink  I'll handle tomorrow when I get there  but today   today I did not drink  February for me   a support group might be helpful    once I get a car and can drive myself to appointments I'll look into the other options  I don't want to rely on my parents to drive me because they aren't reliable and they don't deal with me being treated well which can make things worse I went to a rehab facility for 28 days  One of the hardest things I've ever done  and out of my own choice  I see you have recently quit  congratulations  and keep it up  For the first month or two I used to be so hungry at night because of all the beer I drank  Also  add working out on top of that and I put away food  You get used to it  and great job       These are the tips I am seeking  Wishing a fantastic 2017 and every success to all of you  the most amazing and supportive place I've been    I will spend the first day of the new year being present for my family and not drinking   Happy New Year fellow sobies  May your 2017 be prosperous  wonderful  and rich in the fulfillment that sobriety brings  I would have hung out with you in Boulder    Yeah  But as you say on your original post  you want to do it for her  I'm just suggesting you don't lose sight of that    And FFS  The drinking age in America    Good on inpatient     That's really good news  Don't flake out  stick with it and good luck  So far I've had normal poops  a little loose but normal for how I've been lately  The last one was kinda dark but I wouldn't call it black tar at all  My stomach still isn't super happy with me but it isn't painful  just feels very irritated which could also be a result of my appetite declining a bit after the other night  No more vomit of any kind  especially not bloody   I'm 21  it's EXTREMELY difficult to just do anything in my town other than to drink and none of my friends believe I have a problem so they would obviously offer me and knowing myself I would probably accept  So yes  I know exactly what you're talking about  If someone simply gave me a cup of alcohol I would think twice and drink anyways so I just stay away from it all   Wow  Inspirational  Here's to a sober 17   Thank you    Ancient Mayan secrets  I will not drink with you   Husband's comments seem way out of line and best discussed when you're both sober  Going on day 3 having hard time sleeping due to nightmares im only doing gum to fight severe cravings  Any tips that got you through that you could share  Thanks bud  Hugs    It's the best thing you can do    It's been my experience drinking doesn't erase grief  it preserves it for future sober moments    The only efficient way to deal with this extraordinarily shitty emotion is to sit with it    Again hugs speechless bear hugs from an Internet stranger   me too  Hear here  man  Here's to another new year out of the chains    Made it home completely sober  Was poured a champagne shot at midnight  gave it to the person to my left  Glad I didn't drink tonight  Do you guys celebrate New Years in the UK or is that just an American thing  Yo I've smoked for 5 years and just quit 3 hours ago  Stay strong it's not easy but totally worth it   Agreed  they seemed to be on the caring side of this   38 days I dont think i would have been able to handle a nye party     My friends were pestering me yesterday to go to their NYE party and I used my sobriety as an excuse not to go as I knew it would be shit lol     23 days since my last relapse that lasted three days I was at fifty  I was using a g of hash oil a day  Apart from the drinking voices in my head   Happy new year  Good luck   Thank you  And Happy almost birthday to you   First sober one for 24 years for me  congratulations   It's scary right  Even the memory of that feeling scares me  Here's to a sober 2017  You're almost 90 days  That was a big one for me  Then the triple digits   one day at a time you'll get there   Thank you     Thank you for the support Thank you  So much bleach lol but it finally got there  Happy New Years   What happened to Mariah Carey  Thank you lady  Happy New Years to you and your family    You're not far behind     Mannnnnnn  I go to one of the top rated party schools in the country too  I live within a square mile of 24000  people  where only 20  of people claim not to drink compared to a national average of 44   The big difference with my hometown  Here  fewer people drink  more people abuse prescription drugs like benzodiazepines and opiates  there  they prefer booze  smoke even more weed  and seem to prefer amphetamines and psychedelics  Do I say no  The first time  definitely  the second time  maybe  if they keep offering    well damn  I don't even like drugs  but nothing beats free  right  In my experience  and even as a guy who tends to be able to sort of moderate his drinking  most people just can't understand  and so they do keep offering  They think it's weird  or you're just being polite  or you just had a bad experience one night  Some people just can't understand that bad experiences are  for some of us  a norm  Honestly my struggle with alcoholism has made me far more sympathetic to the prohibitionist movement Although  to be fair  a lot of my friends have ended up on psychiatric prescriptions  so I might just hang around fellow exceptionally fucked in the head people  I can't really say  but I do know our generation loves to drink and has a hard time understanding the few of us who disagree  I imagine it's similar for people of all ages though  different minds just work differently  have you ever been married  are you in some kind of rush   Thank you  I feel I've come so far  Yet so far to go  I know through sobriety all is possible  It's a wonderful feeling   We made it     they just generaly say pams are better than lams for whatever reason  im VEEEERY hungover from wine  cough with valium  cough   not smart rn   I quit on 15th November for good  No backsies  Yummy  I had macadamia chocolates from Hawaii and sparkling cider with my littles tonight  It was lovely  I'm so thankful to be here with them and wouldn't be anywhere else  Happy New Years to you and your family  I'm right there with you internet stranger  We've fucking got this  Congratulations on 365 days       Happy birthday to me  OH wow yeah  why didn't I think of that  BRILLIANT  Gonna pick me up some mask stuff tomorrow  That is awesome thanks  Congratulations    I envy you  What kind of support did you use to get where you are now  What do you continue to do to stay away  Sounds comfy  I don't know why but I love hotel stays  I have such an odd  and probably misplaced if you watch Dateline enough  sense of security when I stay at them  Happy NY  It does   Force yourself to eat something  drink water  take some acetaminophen   Bath or hot shower if you can  is it your birthday or clean day  or both  7 for me   Slept through new year's and I feel great  Awesome feat on this 'typical' day  just add another one  Nothing going on  just typical  no big deal and before you know you got another one under your belt  I will not drink with you today  How are you liking GOT  I'm a book fan  so my views of the show are biased but I did love the first season so much   I like that you're an old soul and you know it  Happy NYs to you  Yeah  true that    For the past 2 summers my life has been hard as hell  with it being record heat temps and all  and me not even able to wear shorts  This summer I seriously want to go to the pool every day  We have this huge pool in our apartment complex  It's so nice  And I have never used it  I HATE walking by the pool every day to check my mail box and hearing everyone splashing around  This summer I'm going to live in the pool        Subscribed    Good for you man  100 a week I'll need a badge reset because of yesterday but I will not drink today  I'm in the exact same situation  I'm sorry  it sucks  Just know that someone out there understands what you're going through   A projected issue maybe  i started where you were 377 days ago  i won't drink with you today  good luck    STAY HYDRATED  and force some food down  you can  you just don't want to    Melatonin for sleep    Thank you  this time last year I was getting ready to go for breakfast at a local pub  It was the day I bought my last beer at a bar    A therapist once told me  don't try to quit more than one thing at a time  He said that would be setting yourself up for failure   I have heard it said that we are only as sick as our secrets so I'm glad you got that off your chest and most importantly that you stayed sober   I am often reminded that what I used to mistake for boredom is really serenity  I was addicted to more than booze and cocaine  I was also addicted to adrenalin  trouble  drama  and out of whack risk taking   For the sleep  I did a couple of sleep studies  In my case it wasn't insomnia but what are called hypnogogic jerks where I get this jumpy  startled feeling right as I am falling asleep  It is very treatable and not so uncommon so I had a good outcome  My health is one of the only things where money is no object because  like sobriety  everything good in my life springs from my good health and sobriety   I used a program of recovery to help me replace my unhealthy self medicating with positive and healthy alternatives  I had a big hole in my soul that needed patching  This turned out not to be as impossible as I had once thought  I relapsed an awful lot  more than average by my reckoning   but sponsor a fellow  for over 20 years now   who stayed sober the very first try  He really wanted to be sober whereas I was the "principled skeptic"  a potentially dangerous personality type  but I made it despite myself  so far anyway      Thanks for sharing and helping me to stay sober for yet another day  Happy New Year   I will not drink today  Great moves OP  Doing the same thing in Australia at the moment  So it's been a little longer  We need to get our lives back  Your post has helped me get through the last part of the day  Thank you  Get ready for the funky dreams haha   I watch the sopranos and went to bed lol   Off to the driving range in a minute   Hi there  Congratulations on quitting   It sounds like you

 Read through this sub  sort by top  for invaluable tips and  most important to me  a sense of community that shows quitting marijuana isn't as easy as we all supposed  Today was cake  No big deal for

sobriety  Things are going well  I will not drink today  Jesus yeah  I wish all my friends would leave me the hell alone  I had to tell one of my buddies to not dare show up with booze around  If I

you  I won't drink with you today   OMG me too  I have just over 18 months clean now too  I was just telling my brother how cool it is to have a full calendar year clean  Congrats  Keep it up  Much love  We are rebels  Same  hope you just had a possession charge and not sales like me  It will only be  blemish on your record    Welcome   This is a fair question to ask and hard for anyone outside a professional or yourself to answer  For me  I knew I was an addict when I tried to stop drinking because of the problems it was causing me but found staying stopped to be very difficult  That is basically AA's step One   It turns out that for me I was self medicating  Alcohol was at first the perfect solution to treat my symptoms of social anxiety  feeling "less than"  feeling bored  and always needing some excitement and stimulation  It worked for a while and then just in the style of that movie  Bedazzled  I discovered a whole horrid downside to drinking and drugging that I thought only happened to  other  people   It took a lot of effort on my part to be relieved of my addictions  but today believe I am better off for having gone through that hell  yet I certainly would never recommend addiction as a self improvement tool    I was fortunate that I was able to draw a lot of good out of what was a lot of bad stuff   I hope you hang around here to learn more about your situation  I have been doing online sobriety since the days of dial up modems and bulletin board services  BBS  and I have found nothing better online than right here     Thank you  I will check out these links tomorrow  It's alot later than I thought it was  I fully appreciate the support  I've definitely puked my guts out   but I can't keep doing it just to prove something to that guy's dad Go to Urgent Care for an Ativan script  Just be honest with them about your issues  Dr  Is the way to go   Thank you for these inspiring words  I believe you when you say it does   Dogs Driving  just bought myself the car I've wanted for over 20 years  it's 16 years old and probably a really stupid purchase but I really want it  Guitars  but I need to teach myself to play again  Drawing Photography   Wooo sign me up   Thank you very much   Thank you very much  I will be posting on here  stay tuned      Goal setting is proven to be successful  Though its more than just saying you want to do  something  It's about creating a plan to achieve said goal   Anyways  awesome  stick to it man   Good luck You're fine dude   It was an accident and you had no desire or intention to smoke up   Be more careful next time    Also take notice of your feelings and thoughts around it  see how the brain can play with you in these situations  I would often get something like " Well you basically relapsed you might as well smoke for the rest of the day and quit tomorrow"     stay strong brutha  For the next couple of weeks   r cripplingalcoholism is participating in our yearly population

subreddit   message compose  to  r cripplingalcoholism  if you have any questions or concerns   You remind me of a fellow sobie I know whose father told him similar things  He also said never  trust a man who can't hold his liquor either  Four DUIs later  this person has made a complete about face  has years of sobriety  and now speaks at institutions for people who are trying to get sober to avoid jail  He has once again reattained his stature as an upstanding citizen and is a true gem in the collection of efforts made all over to help others to be spared the suffering he went through to not only get sober  but also enjoy being sober  I downloaded the reddit app just for this  i'll definitely be reading everyone's stories  Thank you for responding   Yay  Fantastic post  Thank you and wishing you another great year  Weed  No it's a major UK thing  My pleasure to help  Yes  the stories here are amazing as are the resources and the sense of fellowship  I wish this place existed when I was first considering sobriety  I hope to see you around     Me too  I was clear headed and enjoying my friends' company instead of in a fog and probably getting annoyed at stuff that doesn't matter   You know what   guess who will wake up with the worst hangover  feeling like the most shitty people on the planet    If they have a drop of conscience in them  they are gonna feel awful  evil and dumb  And probably have to drink all those horrible feelings away  So here's to you starting the new year sober and strong  and to them waking up feeling like horrible human beings     How vocal are you about your sobriety  I find other sober people insufferable when they constantly bring it up  I'm not in the same style of recovery as most of us here though  It puts me around more drinking than I was comfortable with at your number   Oh yeeeaaaaaah  Congratulations on your first soberversary  I am so pleased for you BadToTheTrombone  hugs and best wishes for a fantastic 2017 x Just keeping in mind that my future self will greatly appreciate it I suppose   I know jack shit about it  do you mean I can just show up and they will invite me to play for free   You and me both I did the same thing  except I don't have any friends   I came to a couple hours after midnight and realized it was the new year while taking a piss   Woo   Happy New Year   Cheers  fucker     Congrats  You've earned quite a good amount of valuable sober time and are a great testimony to those kicking around the idea of getting sober   Your words are very lucid and I agree wholeheartedly with the importance of ongoing work  One cool thing about sobriety is that I get to keep as long as I want it  and all I have to do to keep is to make it  1 in my life  I do that by "practicing these principles in all  my  affairs"  12th step paraphrase     I was told if I made sobriety  1  everything that came 2nd would come 1st class  I have not been disappointed  I have seen things come to pass in my sobriety that are nothing short of miraculous   Thanks for your powerful post this New Year's Day  Me too  It's weird   Been planning this day for 2 months  Telling my parents  my girlfriend  and my dog so that everyone holds me to it  Growing a pair and will look stupid if I can't follow through   Godspeed brother  What do you mean own choice   And since rehab what have you done   I'm an alcoholic addict with 7 yrs clean time btw  I felt the way you do for a long time   For me much of it was because I wasn't comfortable in most situations without a drink    Now days I don't care   and no one else seems to either  I  don't even tell folks that I don't drink  It's rarely relevant these days    Try to not let it bother you and don't overthink it   Checking in   Goodluck all  but lets have more than luck beside us  lets have the well  the plan  and the strength to achieve our similar goal   Happy new year everyone   Great work  as always    I know you're hearing a lot of bitching  but I didn't have a single problem taking the survey   Then again  I was sober  so    Checking in   so far so good for today  and i hope its the same for everyone else  goodluck   They don't sound like adults     I do the same    However it is such a sad feeling knowing that those thoughts are only "thoughts"  and not real  It looks super cute   Congratulations to all 13 victors    Special thanks for FBB and 419er  you both have been a motivation for me personally and obviously a true example of success  keep it up    With people who already know you  yes  some will be weirded out to see you go from drinking to not drinking  That's their problem  not yours  In my experience  most of the people who care have a questionable relationship with alcohol themselves    Nowadays  I find that it's so much easier to politely decline with a "No thanks  I'm good" than to explain I don't drink  For whatever reason  some people take my announcing that I don't drink to be a judgment against their partaking  or they might start to worry about whether or not they should drink in front of me  or wonder about what happened that led me to this place today  By not making an announceme that  I avoid all of that  That's why I find it easier to simply decline rather than explain  Maybe give that a try and see how it goes   I was thinking it wasn't effecting me too  After starting nofap pornfree I realized that is not the case  We get so used to those effects of porn on us  we usually don't even realize that it is affecting us  I am not saying this is the case for you  I don't know your situation  But it may be the case  So what you are doing is very nice  Like you said  if you are not addicted then It wouldn't be a problem quitting  so why not try       I wouldn't tell anyone in real life tbh  It is embarrassing  and people think that it is a normal thing to do  I just told my closest 2 friends that i am abstaining from porn and they respect it  but thats it  I didn't say that I am addicted etc  It's those unseen rewards that really bring a smile to the face  Ok I will get ahold of it  Thank you for the suggestion     Enjoy your time with your Gandma sober  man I miss mine   What did I do before  video games   17 year old   now 35  lol   so Great out doors these days  Love it  You make it sound like a cult     I mean  I can't think of any kind of housing that demands its location be a secret   Shit  Thanks for getting it out of your head  That's what smart  healthy  and successful sober people do    Would you believe that I now find myself in situations where  nonalcoholic  people feel awkward for drinking in my presence and sometimes even ask my permission  typically in my own home   So the social discomfort has done a total reversal where now it is those that drink that appear to experience the discomfort  Of course  It is not my intention to make anyone feel uncomfortable doing what they want to do within reason  It is just who I keep company with these days and probably has something to do with how long I've been away from drinking  and being older too  I rarely if ever feel awkward  OK  there was that time when eating dinner at the top of the Eiffel Tower a few years back   If anything  I actually feel respected  sometimes even  dare I say  admired     This is so great  I'm so pleased for you JungFu   Congratulations on this awesome milestone  you look amazing   I've got three lovelys myself and although it's not all rainbows and lollipops  sober parenting rocks   Here's to a fantastic 2017 to you and your family  many hugs x Good to see your back at it buddy  Life can be pretty sweet with no booze in it  No hang overs  no fuckups  no offending people  well   you get smart about it  drive when ever  weight lose  save coin  reliable  Goes on  Welcome back    tomorrow is the one day of the year you can call out from work  regardless of occupation  and no consequences can be leveled upon you   This a joke  Best feeling knowing you'll be fine driving   Checking in  ready to start another month  Lessons learnt mate  Sounds like you know the plan  Hope your feeling well soon  No court sanction or intervention necessary  That's what I mean by own choice   I've been working and hiding out from the general festivities  I'm going to meetings  keeping to a schedule and doing exercise   Congrats on 7 years  That's awesome  Ahh that feeling  Checking in  good luck everyone  I don't plan or wish to smoke  my cravings are almost non existent   I was just scared for my brain chemistry  because my first month of withdrawal

While I didn't see 2016 completely sober I did manage a few stints   Here's to a sober 2017   I will not drink today     Best wishes to all fellow sobernauts  Wow  I've been reading a lot of inspiring stories to get me through the past couple of days  and yours is the one that has hit me the most powerfully  Congratulations on one year and thank you for sharing how much your life has changed  Your

everybody  Quit on the 31st  Walked into a bar late enough  like 9pm  and just couldn't stand what I saw  Went home straight away  never returned   But I might be ahead of you   usually on the Swedish time  currently on the Irish   Awesome work  fucking awesome move and attitude Hero  Thats what you are   Congratulations  Here's to a healthy future   Happy New Year SD   my warmest wishes to all of

this  Hopefully that number goes up this year   Strength  You're worth it  95 days to go  To beat the odds  I will do it  I will do it so friging bad  Thank you for hosting and Happy New Year  What a great start to 2017  I woke up at 6 30am and ran 5k  I am very pleased with myself  Just sat here listening to Bill Burr podcast and about to make an omelette  Have a healthy and prosperous 2017 people  I will not drink today  First sober New year's that I can remember  I will not drink today   If I was a wrestler this would be my slogan   Awesome work mate  Breaking bad habits can be tough  I'm back on the grind of quitting  longest 18 months   slipped into bad habits and it's game over for alcohol  Things that got me by in the past  Gym  cardio  kickboxing  sarspiralla  ginger beer  having a 'tug'  swimming  sauna  pushups challenges   Life can be boring  but just remember why you quit and how fucked up it could be with alcohol   Oh yeah  Of course it'll do the job  but fuck me running off it just doesn't taste the worst  And I'll neck popov   Free booze is free booze though  My experience is my most valuable asset  What is my experience anyways  It is a collection of all my mistakes  With that said  I am a highly experienced person      A sponsor I had a while back  who ended up being like that great Zen master  Yoda type teacher and mentor  used to tell me  "The closest we come to perfection is that we identify our mistakes and we correct them  That's what successful people do " So that is what I have tried to do ever since   With some time  I became quite adept at handling such situations and with a lot of time  I find that most of those awkward situations just go away on their own or don't manifest to begin with  In fact  I'll go as far as to say the tables have largely turned and at most of the social gatherings I attend or host  it is now the drinker that sometimes appears to be in the awkward situation  I'm never judgmental or critical as there's nothing worse than a reformed drinker openly spouting his hatred of alcohol in front of guests  I've experienced a modicum of success in my sober life so I think some of the people I meet make the association of not drinking with success in life  In my case  they would be 100  right       So glad to be sober this morning   Yup  I think I passed out around 9pm  Just woke up  5am here   Made fish and chips  Watching a crime documentary  Drinking Jim Beam  Happy New Year  How does that happen  Just a test  sounds like your passing it   The amount of times I had to walk drunk on new years    but hey  we can all drive now  Pushups  get into'em and blow off some steam  Life is getting pretty sweet at 14 days there mate   oh  i used to do that too   Antibiotics and alcohol   oh dear   Fingers crossed recovery time is a lot faster    New year  clean slate  I intend to finish this year the way I started  I will not drink today  Wow  you runners are nuts  Goals man  impressive  Stick with it man  Those pancakes sound fantastic   Thanks  and happy new year  Ain't it just the best   Chef called me awake at 1530 to remind me that I'm a bit late for nye service   Back home  Alone  And drinking   So edgy and Badass  Congratulations    So proud of you    I've been looking at doing yoga for a while   a little while back I decided on Hatha yoga   I wanted something that would help de stress me and help with anxiety  That's on my to do list now    I will not drink with you today   Did 60 days last year then thought I could be a" social drinker"     Happy New Year  I will not drink today  lol there are some sober people down under    Hello mate  fellow limey here  Good to have you with us  Taking a month off it a good way to reassess your relationship with alcohol and have a think about what it means to you  What's the plan to stay on track  Well done on the 32 days by the way  a sober Christmas is no mean feat   So they finally posted my bloodwork online  They did a lot of shit  more than I'm used to  Stuff like pancreas function  Some specific tests you order for people with a history of alcoholism  and also a couple of tests to make sure the chest pain  which felt like a gorilla sitting on me  wasn't caused by heart issues  Xray was normal  blood showed no signs of a possible stroke or heart attack  Sodium was low  which explains all the muscle aches and cramping I had for the days leading up to this  Looking back  I can say I definitely mistook the tenseness for the early signs of DTs  as I tend to start shaking really bad and all of my muscles get really tense before it gets really bad   I'm sore as hell today  but feel more alive than I have in a long time   One liver count was elevated   38  normal is 8 20  I've seen my bloodwork after being treated for bad DTs  my AST was in the hundreds before  She said based on how much I said I drink  and how much alcohol she could smell on me at the time  that she expected far worse   So yeah     bloodwork  at least  shows I wasn't in anything resembling DTs or severe withdrawal  And I wasn't shaking uncontrollably at any point this time  My hands have been shaky since I got out  but not badly   I'm absolutely going to work on a plan with my doctor to get me on something to help with the cravings  probably naltrexone  which I've had good luck with in the past   get something for anxiety  and start attending AA again  Anxiety is absolutely the main reason I drink these days  and as tolerance builds from drinking every day  it turns into a physical addiction again  I'm also going to look into outpatient rehab again  I've done a 30 day once  and an outpatient 90 day once    I know I'm getting too old to keep going like this  I'm ready to quit for good   tl dr bloodwork  ER doc  and looking back at it today  ER doc is right  it was a severe panic attack   I'm really glad it wasn't DTs  and given how much I had been drinking over the past week  I'm surprised it wasn't  Going to talk to doctor about getting back on naltrexone  hopefully get anxiety meds that aren't SSRIs  preferably not benzos  but I'll do benzos if I have to   I'm not much on pills  but I do have a history of coke and meth addiction in my early 20s  alcoholism since I quit everything except alcohol and very occasional weed   don't even touch caffeine   Drinking these days is for anxiety  not to get drunk  I don't know if you have insurance  but Gabapentin and Lorazepam helped me with my spasms   Hope today is better for you  Congratulations  Loose weight  around 15kg in 12 months  get fit again and attempting vegetarian   but after tonight's dinner  was disappointing  Lol Good to have you here u Adders80  let's do 2017 clear and sober  Wonderful post  Good on you   There are lots of options to get support    12 step and SMART recovery are the options I can suggest checking out  The health system may also have options available to you    For me there was a long journey to recognize that I used against my will  Even longer to realise I'd hurt so many people that cared about me    I'm guessing you've tried to stay stopped previously  I won't drink today  Thanks for everything at the end of last year SD   I look forward to spending 2017 with you too   The sea is 2 minutes from my door  I should swim more  Yo that rhymed as well  it's a sign Two shots within half an hour   Love this   Edit  and your username   Great to have you with us  Maybe its a sign you should drop the dopest rap album of 2017  Good to hear you are going well   It helps to hear from those a little further along    'Never trust a man who doesn't drink'   heard that a few times  being Aussie 'what's wrong with ya'   ah man  same reason I don't do meth  not a fan mate   Saying you have become a 'whole' person is where it all lies    life will always have ups and downs  living sober is about embracing the balance you bring into your life  Embracing those ups and downs  We can't all be happy all of the time  but we can handle what comes our way as well as possible when we are sober   Congratulations  Be alcohol free  upgrade my alfresco area  go to an accountant and get a financial plan made  possible property investment  keep lifting weights  be a good mum  be a good wife  And yours   I often build things up in my head  If I think about something too long ill talk myself out of it  I am glad went to a meeting without thinking about it too long  Good luck  Mine was sleeping   I haven't slept well in 20 years of being a piss head on a daily basis Awesome  It's 2 30 am  I'm in bed after working a 14 hour shift  I'm getting up in 7 hours to run 2 5 miles around a lake and then jump in it     I'm excited  I've never done this before   I vow that 2017 will be full of Never Done Befores     Sounds pretty close to a drunk new year's    Remember that you're doing this for you  And happy new year    Soon  everything about your life WILL be different  Recovery is a complete lifestyle change  x Checking in A Happy new year everyone  With new year comes new opportunities and new chances Let's hold on to those chances and kick porn out of our systems forever   Good luck everyone True  SSRIs are known to be extremely finicky   Frankly  our neuroscience is in its primitive stages   I'm someone who tried three SSRIs with no discernible effect at all  positive or negative   And then the fourth one changed my life     My advice has to be that you shouldn't necessarily expect much from an SSRI  but they're definitely worth a try if your condition warrants it  Ooooo   Look at Mr  Fancypants over here  Able to pass out   Bah  Just don't follow through  I'm 28 and about to go through my second divorce  Whoops  Ughhh  You're back here and that shows a lot x It's so damn hard to be in an environment where people are drinking in the early stages  I thought I could do it   I failed   again   and again   I had to put myself in lock down or avoid situations as best I can for the moment until I get a bit stronger and it makes things even harder when people around you are not supportive at all   "It bloody is to me  I'm done  No more socialising with people who can't respect my boundaries "   well said  Keep fighting  You can do this x  Congrats on 365  Checking in  Good luck everyone  I messed up right at the end of 2016 when my girlfriend took a break  Won't happen in 2017  Welcome  it's good to have you here  I'm 29f  careful with diet and since I stopped drinking I have got into great shape and can eat more of the yummy stuff  This is such a positive change  I suggest reading This Naked Mind free on the side bar  Written by a women  completely mind changing  Definitely re setting your brain for habits like stopping for a bottle on the way home or rewarding yourself with alcohol or consoling yourself when stressed  I found it took about a month for that to start changing but I kept picking up on what my mind was doing so it was helpful  Have a fantastic start to 2017 I don't remember if I took the survey or not  That's cool buddy  everyone has a different experience with it  and I'm glad it helps you  Personally  when I smoke it daily I just get lethargic and down so I'm the opposite really  Plus joints are rolled with tobacco here and that's been my downfall twice already  So I'm giving the triple whammy a try this time    Best of luck to you and wishing you a great 2017  Check in time Stay strong everyone  it's time to go monster hunting   May the odds ever be in your favor   Nice  Drinking isn't going to help bud  well maybe the detox  but realistically it's time to face up to the SHORT term consequences   The Detox  It sucks  drink heaps of water  some sugary drinks  showers  panadole  gatorade  go for a walk and think to yourself what you have to loose  It's only a few days of shit to go through  it DOES end  The shakes will go  the nausea no more  sleep will get better  mood will feel so much better  Still strugglng  see a GP and they can help  But man  how much better of a husband and father will you be   You'll be admired  respected and even envied   Find a job and get my own place I dont like living with people anymore I want my own space Anything of note come out of it  Happy 2017 to you too   I have had many dry Januarys in a row and the key for me was just keeping the focus on the next 24 hours  you know  stay in the moment  My plan  like yours  is to stay sober for good  Nothing wrong with planning  I put it in my digital calendar and then forget about anything I have to do beyond today until that day comes  It actually helps me focus on today   In early sobriety  I was diagnosed with almost everything in the book  including bipolar formerly known as  manic depressive   it seems and was medicated accordingly  In my case  with time  the doctors' diagnoses changed and gradually  I got a clean bill of health  both body and mind  The key for me is that I don't play doctor  If I need to see one  then I do it  that simple  Then I will be a responsible and active patient  including questions  feedback  and 2nd opinions if necessary  My health is the LAST thing that I will skimp on costs with   Yep agree I've had this reaction but I just say I'm so happy to not be drinking and I'm so much happier being alcohol free  That makes it a positive and I've found when I say it like that the reaction is much better  And how can you argue with someone being happy     Yay   Happy for you a big NDV I'm with you too  sign me up please  thanks    What an achievement  Well done     This    I will not drink today  Does that mean we get to blow up a moon sized space station  I wanna use the force  D Comfy pj's   bliss good job HappyPillmore    Congratulations all of you   Can't wait to see my name on the list in 2017   2018  Checking in   Not much to report at the moment I cant answer for you but I will say it sounds like you might be picking up on something early which is fantastic  There's a book free from the side bar called This Naked Mind  I think it might really help you  it helped me  All the best  Hate it when my phone goes flat out   owned the park  Lol   This is why we don't drink  what a cool night  Sign me up  please and thank you Not drinking is working out pretty well for me  so I'm going to keep up with that    I'm going to work on figuring out what I want to do job wise  I like my job enough  but I think this year may be bringing changes whether I like it or not  Healthy eating and working out are high on the list too   Checking in  thus far everything is normal  I feel the pain your having right now  This sucks  Take some time to yourself to do the things you enjoy that aren't drinking  Like go for a  walk in nature or something    I could help   Good on you   Honestly I was feeling so strong  Until the pressure was on and then I was afraid I'd offend the host  How stupid is that  My sobriety is important to me BUT I'm a people pleaser codependent and always put myself last  Not again  My New Years resolution is to take better care of my needs REGARDLESS of how others feel  without hurting people of course   I am slightly miffed that SO threw me under the bus with the driving thing as I felt sabotaged BUT in the end the responsibility is mine alone  X Excellent distinction  once it's inside me I lose control of it  so best keep it outside   I would reply 'well I like me better when I'm sober'  Sorry you had to hear that  it must have been very hurtful  I think sometimes when we stop the remaining drinkers believe then that their own drinking will be called into question  I have been guilty on nights out wishing one non drinker would be drinking too because as they are sober they will remember everything  I have said and done  Seems stupid now but yes  I was projecting that they might notice what a heavy drinker I really was   I'm on a different sober forum for years and while I was single myself as I met my partner during a sober period  I know many marriages from others on there have hit hard times when one stops  It brings a clarity with it from our side too and relationship problems can suddenly come to the fore  Awesome news  I'm 4 weeks deep and it's good to see some light at end of tunnel    P s how do you get the number of days next to your name  Thanks   You put yourself and your sobriety first and that is awesome  A lot of the time people aren't really having as much fun as it looks on social media  I know I was so much happier at home sober than bringing in the new year in the city because every time I drank it was like rolling the dice  Would this night be ok or would I black out and cause myself drama  I would rather be a nana in bed at 9 30pm than roll that dice   Thanks Sophiestar79   Life feels different in 2017  Good  I think   Yeah  It happens to me periodically  but it's usually followed by periods of more intense dieting self hatred   Sign me up       I'm really not announcing it  and maybe this is reflective of the people in my life  but I tend to get asked what my favorite drink is  or what I'm drinking this weekend  or it gets strongly suggested to me to drink  "No  but thanks" works for the last one unless they push  and it's my go to  Maybe alcohol is just that pervasive in American culture  I will not drink today  Did not drink this Christmas or NYE thanks to this sub   Congrats twin year bro sister   It's great feeling this way  Hold your horses Lee  thanks to the leap year I've still got 13 hours to go     D   Thank you  Thank you  If ever there's motivation to quit that might be it  Sounds frustrating and also sad for you  I come from the complete opposite with straight parents and grandparents  never been drunk  Not sure what happened with me    happy to not drink with you today  HNY HP  Sounds rough but it also sounds like you're learning from it    I find driving is a great excuse when I'm not sure of how things might turn out  so maybe you could drive more often  and even dress it up as a benefit for your SO   Great job  and I'm glad you had a good time  I feel really optimistic about the new year also  peace and happiness to you too  Sounds like he's projecting his own insecurities on you  I've had that many times with work friends  I went to a work party one year when I stopped drinking for some time  the 'cool' guy later after drinking 8 of his 10 pack cans of Jim Beam said to me 'How did you do it  I hate this and want to quit too'   People love to see others fail  makes them feel better    Keep at it  Go for it  It's not stupid at all  I don't think the host was being very respectful to be honest  No is no    It's easy to say in hindsight   I'm a people please myself and it's something I'm working on as my health  sobriety depends on handling situations just like this  It's fucking hard  From it though it sounds like you've learnt more about yourself and what doesn't work  you can take that away from it x If you can look forward and be kind to yourself  Its the start of a new year  A fresh start    I wont drink with you today x That's rough  two really awful infections  Sorry you're going through this  Might lag to get your immunity levels checked  Hope you're feeling much better soon Bro  people would do this shit when I drank  And people would do this when I quit    Guess what  They weren't my friends   That's half the advice I'm ganna give   The other half is some people just don't know how to deal with you being sober  If they are your friend  worth keeping  they may just need time to adjust to the new you  your new lifestyle  It sounds like he was trying to be considerate but just fucked up  So it's good you told him how you feel  He know how you feel  Give him a day to sit on it  Bring it up later  Or maybe go out to a smaller setting with alcohol and show him you don't need alcohol  New Years parties tend to be pretty off the hook  I wouldn't want to go out with my best friend to some New Years party    Not everyone is like me  but as an adult  i hate Halloween now because it was a great holiday to go out and drink  New Years is much the same now  I spend it with my family instead of friends   Stop smoking  I stupidly started again after 11 months off them and the booze  With one came the other  I was running half marathons a year ago  would like to get back to that if my bad back would permit me to     On that note  do my physio exercises every day    Cut back on meat  I've been trying a vegetarian diet and while it's been ok so far  I'm not putting any pressure on myself to keep it up  cutting back long term would suffice  You're lucky no one cared  at a party the other night I had people questioning me on my drinking choices and others questioning me on theirs    I'm sorry you're hurting    My wife wasn't too thrilled about my alcoholism and said something similar when I first bought it up      I continued drinking for 7 more years    In hindsight  I had bought it up at a bad time and in a bad context    I also had not explained to her how bad it was getting     When I finally broached the subject again  I came clean with her about how much I was drinking  the fact that I could not stop  and that I was feeling suicidal       It was still a bit of a shock for her as I had hidden my alcoholism well    But she came around quickly and is very supportive now       All the best to you   Hey there HP   Happy New Year to you my friend  many hugs x You start by getting on the horse and focus on the day at hand and continue one day at a time  I'm having a giggle   ice box   shoe box   I'm sure they look similar if you were drunk      Who know what else you might find and where  Happy New Year     I will not drink today  Thank you  This probably isn't what you were thinking but putting shoes in the freezers gets rid of shoe odor  the cold kills the bacteria   Your description of anxiety  piecing together the black out and racing heart is such a good description I 100  know this feeling  Welcome  It's a great feeling to know you will never have to feel that horrible hangover   black out   alcohol induced anxiety ever again  Sometimes we need things to happen for us to realise things need to change  All the best  I won't drink with you today Congrats Josephine  it's crazy what a difference a year can make  Happy 2017  Me too  good luck to us both  My girlfriend does the same thing   I'm glad you are getting  counseling  work closely with her him   With respect to your question of whether you 'passed the point of return'  I really don't think there is such a place time   We always have it within us to turn around   To do good   To loved    To be loved   Stay strong  checking the cock monkey in  ready to live life in 2017  best luck all Good for you      The bad feelings will pass    I honestly can't remember more than a handful of NYE's in my 46 years    I was always smashed      And the ones I do remember we're because something bad happened     You really didn't miss much     Way to go      I caved in and had 4 drinks on new years eve over a period of 7 hours  The whole time i didn't enjoy it and even poured the last one out  Cliche  but i'm done with booze new years day  it's all out of the house  start a new job tomorrow and i'm excited  There's only a few things in life 'you just know'  this is one of them   I've requested to have my badge commenced today  Wooohooooooooooo  Hang in  only one slip with a lot of triggers present  No hate the self  hate the addiction  congrats on taking the challenge Congrats man I play to have a year just like you   So far so good went into the new year didn't drink and am not hungover I feel amazing for the first new year in almost a decade  Best of luck bro   Congrats  it's nice reading that  Congratulations to all of you   Congrats all  nearly slipped but managed to stay off the porn machine  I masturbated about three time  twice last week  Hopefully  this won't lead to a relapse  One day at a time  Does does your boyfriend know about your recovery   If he doesn't  clue him in  A good partner should always make you feel like the sexiest person on earth  especially when you're naked  Sign me up  Sign me up  With you all too guys   this shit has ruled my life for the last 12 years  A week strong atm  good luck to all    first month is the shittest    No porn   Reading your post triggered me to PJO  Pancakes  Jam  Orgasm       Sell them on ebay for slightly less than their value 1 No problem  You see  everyone is different  Even when we are addicted  no two people are addicted in the same way or for the same reasons  If I had to try and pinpoint it  I would say my addiction stems from a real world lack of confidence in my social skills and my image  I have massive anxiety working with people or being in a classroom  etc  Those issues are very difficult to fix  and being in my mid 20's doesn't really help  So what helps me feel better  Gaming  Load up any Blizzard game and enter the world of make believe and all your problems temporarily go away  until you log off  Then reality hits  which is scary  so it's time to run right back to video games because these feelings suck and we don't want to deal with them right now   It's pretty much escapism 101  I usually can't even sleep anymore without watching Twitch  This is because when you lay down and try to sleep  your mind becomes clear and you think about real life  If your intentions are to avoid the negative feelings associated with your real world issues  then you essentially need to be drugged out all the time  through gaming  in order to get through even a simple task like sleeping  otherwise you will have insomnia    Some people are alcoholics  and some people are drug addicts  we happen to be game addicts  They are all very similar  If you solved your real issues  I'm confident gaming wouldn't have the same effect on you as it does now  Australia is pretty bad to mate  It's culture pretty much and some people as you said don't know any better  In the past when I quit i did announce it  was awkward as fuck every single time  So I changed my tune to giving my liver a break for a while  seems to work as 'these' people would often say 'haha  you gotta do that at times' or whatever and let it go  The fact that you say you do it out of boredom suggests that you need something else to do during times of boredom   Is that the pushups   Is it going for a drive   It might help to have a list of things that you will do any time boredom  and its accompanying urges  might set in     Good luck  It takes a while for people to get used to the sudden change in your regular behaviour  At least they thought about your situation and decided to be supportive  even if they got it wrong  They didn't make fun of you and pressure you into drinking  You are lucky to have such friends  No man is an island  You are in the victim stage of addiction depression it is the stage where you feel sorry for yourself  These are all my issues  how can I ever deal with them  At this point you can't go any lower without them putting you in the ground  Every day you told yourself not today  was a day closer to where you are now  Everyone on this board has done it  Most people in this world have done it  You're not special  Understand that this isn't unique to you   The escorts probably did it too  I wouldn't worry about them  They also have their own problems  maybe they were victims of themselves  of their situation  maybe they were saving up for a Holden  Who knows  Everyone deals with their issues differently and rarely do people respond to an extended hand to help them with their cool emotional problems   Sure  some women may judge you for the escorts  but they will understand that it happened in a low part of your life  They've done something in their past that helped them deal with the dark times  If they haven't they're either lying or they're so boring you don't want them anyway    Everyone has had a suicidal thought  Everyone  This is also not unique to you   What do you do now  You get help  either go to a doctor explain you're depressed and you might want to go the medical route with antidepressants or get yourself to a therapist  or someone to talk to you about this  professional would be better  probably     We can help keep you on track  But we aren't people in your life  I'm in NSW  so probably closer geographically to you than most on this subreddit  But what are we going to do for you  You're asking for help  make this your first step to actually doing something that helps you  Tomorrow is Monday this time next week would be your completion of a week  Or We will see you again January 1st 2018   Sorry to hear that  I know all to well the feeling of relapse   That you went 40 days tells me that you can go forever   But it does always start with day 1 and continues one day at a time from then   Focus on the day at hand and acknowledge today is not the day     You've got this  Way to go    You've got this  and enjoy the pancakes  Day 2 again  This is my time now  I sure hope so  It's been a rubbish last 3 years of addiction  Peace  Good going  The enhanced perception of the aroma of booze is a thing for me too  My wife will occasionally  like maybe three times a year  have a vodka or three and I can smell it when I walk in the door as I get home from work  Keep it going man    Not drinking today happy new year SD  Get right back on the horse   You've got this  Yeeehaaa  Happy new year  Good choice  I found last night tough and found myself having feelings of regret about staying in  However  NYE last year was the moment I decided I seriously had to change my relationship with alcohol at the very least  and abstain totally ideally  So the very fact that a year on from that moment I chose  despite my great desire to go out  to stay in and stay sober is evidence of how much I have grown in 2016   thanks to all of you    I will not drink today and I'm very  very happy about that   Happy new year  Stay strong  focus on today   Can you commit to staying  free today   Try taking this one day at a time   You've got this  I hate those comments   like alcohol made me a better person  It's bullshit and I have refused to accept those comments and generally say something along the lines of 'No alcohol did not make me more fun because it wasn't me   Hang in there not everyone gets it  I won't be drinking tonight  I have so many triggers  but beer may be the biggest of them  GL  Do you need to tell your girlfriend because you've spoken of this in the past and this is part of an agreement you made   If so  I commend you on your honesty   You had made it 2 months which says you have it in you to keep going   To never stop   One day at a time  sir   one day at a time  I'm in  Time to make a change  One day at a time  you've got this  Yay  congrats      I got through my first day myself with surprisingly little issue  I was even offered a free bottle of wine  and graciously turned it down   Go us   D Happy New Year  Good luck  you've got this  Music  I used to breathe music and worked as a sound engineer  Alcohol almost killed my love of music  it came to a point when for a few years I barely listened to anything  That love came back big time when I stopped drinking  what a waste  Checking in  so true  it's the only time I see family and being the drunkard  I get my name thrown around whenever there is alcohol involved   one day I'll be a hermit and die alone Congrats on the 42 days   You've shown you've got it in you to beat those urges   So stay strong  you've got this  I'm sorry you're suffering     It's tough in the early days but it gets so much easier      Wishing you all the best    Gaming has consumed me to the point where I no longer do it as a social hobby with some friends  but I instead use it as a way to run from every single problem that arises in my life to the point where I become completely dependent on the feeling of gaming in order to get me through the day  It's no different than being an alcoholic or a drug addict   I played Overwatch for about 14 hours a day   The motivation  I want to live a normal life again  Awesome  Congratulations on a year  and happy 2017  Maybe it's because of the new year  but at 6 months I feel ready for a new beginning  It's inspiring to see how happy you are now despite not everything being perfect  Thanks for sharing  and thanks for the Gonzo flash from the past  Glad you're here   Your support is welcomed and be sure we offer it in return   Welcome and good luck  This is exactly how I felt this NYE  It sucks and i'm STILL not happy about it but I know that I made the right decision    AND because I made the right decision that was also the more difficult decision I feel like a real adult  Look at all this willpower I have  mere mortals  I'm proud of myself despite how much FOMO I'm experiencing  the FOMO will fade but I'm quite sure the pride will have a lasting effect on my opinion of myself and what I'm capable of    Congratulations on flexing your willpower muscle and staying strong   What a beautiful FACE in your star    Congratulations  on not drinking last night  and 1 year  Serious advice  Maybe give up gum as well  Just a thought though   I agree with Lamp's comment   You've got what it takes   One day at a time  It's good that you recognise vulnerable times  like being tired  so learn from this and keep going  I went out and had fun  Went home after midnight because the drunks were getting sloppy and annoying   Hey  me too    Good luck  Direbrain  and  u coldbeers Thank you  I think 6 months is what it took me to realize I was over recovering and it was time to make some new moves  I wasn't worried anymore  Congrats on your 6 months  I really don't miss embarrassing stuff Ive done drunk  And belive me I cant remember most of them but I do have a suitcase full of those scenes  Welcome and I wont drink with you today  I not only already pee n someones bed while wasted but woke up in my exs pee  Well I cant unpee what Ive pee on  But sure can prevent myself of not doing again  Been lurking for a few weeks  realised I have a problem with alcohol that's been with me since my teens  about 25 years ago  This is my first comment and day one of stopping drinking  I will not drink with you all today  What do you mean by feeling like garbage  Is it the cravings or something else  Sign me up    I remember this day last year because it was the day I tried to quit drinking  I quit for 30 days and then started again in February and quit for good in July  I'm looking forward to celebrating a year of sobriety this year  I'm staying sober today   Sign me up    Sign me up We got this  2 days in   Must be honost  doesn't feel good atm  but I know it will get better in a few days  And here we are on January 1   Day one of the year   I'm looking at my badge that has '28' on it   That's nice  I'm working on it   I look at those whose badges read 280  and that's nice  too  they're working on it   Similarly  I'm seeing people with badges that say "1"  They  too are working on it   But for each of us  it's not the past that dictates our future success   Sure  a successful past may lead to confidence in what we do today and in the future   But ultimately  it's what we do today  what we do now  that defines us moving forward   So  let's take a look whatever our badge numbers  large or small  tell us   But that's not where our success lies   It's with what we do in the future   But that future begins now   It begins today   And you know what   I can tackle that   Not today   Happy 2017  Awesome  congrats on a year  Checking in  F   yeah      Happy first day of 2017 to all SD   First day of new years that I wake up sober n full of energy in seventeen years  Time to catch up    checking in  Checking in  Not drinking w you all today   Checking in  Happy new year  Checking in  This is my first ever challenge  Here's to a strong 2017  Happy to share that I also had a lovely time NOT drinking at a NYE party  Better time in fact that I would have had if I was drinking  Clear headed  able to converse without slurring and not being the drunk chick of my past sells  was fabulous    I was just scared and mad at my gf that I delayed my path to homeostasis   Also  when I was in a room where people smoked the spliff  I lit up a cigarette and held it in front of my nose  Made it    Will not drink today  Try giving them a call  410 663 1922    I'm sure whoever is handling the hotline tonight will be able to help you  As it is almost 7 AM where you are  there will be meetings starting at any time now    Good luck and I hope you find some inner peace   I'm upvoting this as hard as I fucking can  Thank you    You know it   Happy New Year    Not Drinking today I'm the same way  I love staying in hotels  It's like an adventure    I always watch dateline too lol   Thank you   Thanks  I don't crave a drink at all  but I wasn't prepared how much this physically hurts  Hopefully it goes away soon I have some friends that even if i pushed away for a these two years or a year want to see me still contact me  I told my closest one my problems because I couldn't take it anymore  He was very supportive  Should I burden them  I feel like I want to be honest and not hide anymore  I've been hiding my whole life and that hasn't worked out for me  I'm thinking of just telling my closest ones I think I've always wanted too but couldn't and held back   Also is the victim stage a bad thing  I think I understand I have to now do something about it  I just feel a little hopeless still  Thanks for your help   Sounds like you know what you need to do  Get yourself a big bottle of water  some gatorade  some panadole  two minute noodles until you see your GP to get through the detox  When I was hung over going through that cycle I would watch youtube learning vids  DYI  shit i'm into and vlogs    that shit really helped me get through the first few days in the past  What's awesome about your post is  you know what you need to do  10 years of it  i did it for 17    sucks ass and you're lucky to be thinking so straight  Set some life goals and how you're going to get it done  Check out some vids on youtube for anxiety to help you  I found some to be helpful for my anxiety  'socially awkward' anxiety for me can be intense  but working on it    You got this  no more hang overs  take back your life  Check in here every day  vent  read and share   You got this  It's going to hurt but you can do it  just for today   Drinking won't help at all Checking in  this also is my first ever challenge so let's make this year a success    I'm spending about  90 per week for two eighths or one quarter  That's more than half my rent like what have i been thinking    Awesome and inspiring  Exactly this   I can drink but I don't want to   Not even a sip   I will not drink today  Happy New Year everyone Good morning  Happy New Year and I will not drink today  Update   I got busy  kissed my kids  worked out and feel much better   I am taking "mistake boredom for serenity" for future reference and  am smashing ginger ale like its going out of fashion but a good sarspiralla is tough to get in the UK   SD is a good place to be    Happy Birthday mate  Awesome work   hey never alone on the internet  Hang on  It won't always be this way     Have I passed the point of no return for me   Yes you're fucked  Sorry man   I'm kidding  As you are learning right now  recovery is a right bitch  We've all thought this at one point or another  and we all think our situation is uniquely different from others such that we'll be the first ones to never recover at all   There is no "point of no return" to be honest  Besides death anyway  Unless you're dead there is always a window of opportunity open to you to get past this   even if you can't always see that window    Recovery is multifaceted journey that will constantly challenge you  So if you've fallen from grace  reframe it as a necessary experience in your catalogue of experiences  Don't beat yourself up over your situation or every relapse  I mean  I know you will naturally  but try to minimise it  it's part of the addiction cycle

getting sober is one thing  keeping it up can be frigging hard  Nicely done   Happy New Year   Sounds like you want a change in your life   2017 is a great year for change  The other day I got up

great people at SD  could not have done it without YOU     The plan sounds awesome  Can't beat that feeling  Stick around  You can do this    I will not drink today   Happy to end 2016 and start 2017 sober  First few days are the hardest  IMO  Do whatever it takes to make it through  because you will crave  I'm proud of you for taking this first step   I'm not drinking with you today   Never propose coming out of a 15 year drinking binge  I'm nearing the end of that mistake  Seriously  get your shit together enough to not do that  You'll save yourself so many troubles  Thanks    I really  really  appreciate your reply    Checking in    still going strong  Awesome job guys  Way to do it   Let's go   all your problems temporarily go away  until you log off    Yes  so until my IRL offline problems are solved  I'll stop gaming   maybe I'll play again watch videos later when things are better   but you're right as of now it's just another  feel good  drug to replace the worries and problems I have     Thanks once again Checking in    not much to report  Good luck everyone  Indeed  it's an awesome holiday    And it was a race relations forum after the whole Jena 6 thing  A decade later it's mostly forgotten  but at the time it was a huge deal  https   en wikipedia org wiki Jena Six I definitely gave in to the sugar urge  Whew  Remember  in most countries  a proposal is not a legal issue marriage is  Much simpler and easier to walk away from a proposal than marriage    If you've got a taste for proposing  propose something else  Purpose you go pearl diving in the south

up not hungover this morning  and it feels great  I will definitely not be drinking today  day 5   Huh  did that yesterday  I've literally proposed three times in the past two weeks  And I'm not too visibly drunk apparantly  so I have to explain that shit away after   Hey man  sounds like a good conversation to have  Had one similiar with my wife  it's on my posts 'Binge Drinker'   So the afternoons are your worst  plan to do something else  go to the gym  swim  pushups  walk the dog  visit someone  work on a project  something different to break the time period of habit    Mind to bottle connection  think about what it has done to you and makes you feel  what it's taking away from you  it thinks your a pussy and is the boss   own it and pour it out in the sink  be the boss  Your mood will get better  maybe loose a couple kg  save some money  be reliable  a better husband  no more regrets   Uh  I've lived in confidential housing plenty of times  It's for safety reasons  I'm being intentionally vague because it's really not business that all of reddit needs to get nosy about    Just be glad you've never had to be in this situation    Great job coming back here   Happy New Year everybody  7 days in  Another goal hit    My sleep is starting to improve and I'm feeling real emotions again  I teared up at a movie last night  Good times    Here's to a sober 2017  I dont know why the fuck you are not proud of your 28  I'm loving me 21  My last record was 5 and it was done on vacation   with people in the house you know   28 rocks dude  I do this all the time     Drunk Jax wants to get married   have your babies and buy a house    Sober Jax just may think your kind of cute  Congrats on two weeks   I'm with you   as long as I don't take that first drink  I stay in control  It's wonderful that your husband is supportive    Smell of wine   oh my  yes it is strong  I have family visiting  about a month  they are great  and my brother likes to have a glass of red wine with dinner  I cannot believe how strong and unpleasant I find the smell  Thankfully  wine was never my alcohol of choice  so having it in the house is not a problem    Happy travels and happy new year  Yep I know that feeling  own space is so important  Some good goals there  go smash em  I went to bed at ten    And life is much better than good  We believe in you  Considering he was just at the ER    I don't think he needs to be told this  If they were going to rx him something  they would have then   sign me up  Resisted the urge to buy a new pack before the year ended last night  I'm totally done with them  My biggest struggle will be that most of my good friends and pretty much all of my coworkers are smokers so It'll be tough to resist  even tougher to get down off my high horse when I look back at what I've achieved in 2017  I will not drink today  Happy new years to all of you  I will not drink today  Welcome  The sidebar is full of helpful interesting reads  Honestly  this may sound silly and or may not work for you  but I have found that embracing the choice to not drink  today  has made sobriety a bit more manageable  That and reading here daily and making a plan of things I will do or drink instead of drink alcohol    I will not drink alcohol with you today  Instead it will be coffee  tea  and a bit of fizzy water   They do  but today it's only the new year in America  It's next week in the UK  they're on a different calendar   all the extra letters in words like colour and aluminium delay things a bit      Kinda like how Chinese new year isn't in American January either    Happy birthday and happy 36 days  Thanks for your response  Much appreciated  Not sure what you mean by 'side bar'   Keen to find and read This Naked Mind  Thanks again  I refuse to accept a beverage of any alcoholic strength or substance on this day  a day of new beginnings  Yuhuu  300 participants  Let's go guys  First night in over a month I did not PMO and I feel great already     Exactly   I just have to stay away from it next time  I'm sorry the end of the night was not celebratory    Welcome to the sub   Happy new year  It was a heavy trigger   luckily I have deleted all my games  permanent  so I wouldn't fall back to binge gaming again  checking in   lets go I'm in   Checking in Thanks  I was clean for most of 2016 but good to try and do a full year officially  In my opinion anyone who says that does not want their own drinking challenged   I know when I was drinking if I told my sober friend that it would have been exactly for that reason   I'm sorry to hear your husband is like that   My wife was not 100  on board the first week or two until we talked   And I mean talked   I told her I was not just slowing down  I was done    I explained the hidden caches  the secret extra drinking  the lying about how much  the bad decisions it had led me to   Then she got it and while she may still have a glass of wine she is very sensitive to my feelings and if I'm having a bad day she'll pass on drinking     So at for me  if my wife was drinking heavily I would not have made it this far   You spend way too much time with a spouse partner for that not to matter   Talking it thru in painful detail helped me   Good luck  I won't drink with you today  Happy new year  Woot  Way to ring in the new year Happy NY    I will not drink today   You've got this  Congratulations guys  Agreed  fellow awesome person  True   it's like if you've quit smoking but still smoke occasionally there's a big risk that you will relapse and start smoking again  Hey  I'm in  Sounds like you can moderate it so you're not nearly addicted and 3 hours a day isn't even a lot   checking in You made a strong decision coming back   I will not drink with you today  Sign me up please  Happy to be here on the first day of 2017 not drinking with all of you fine folks    u iDoneDo thanks for hosting the DCI this week and getting 2017 off to a strong start  Nice post  Happy for you and your kids  I know I'm late but I'd like to sign up please  Not drinking today  Not being alone one this journey has been a huge part of staying sober and building a life where sobriety just makes the most sense        Is La Croix the official beverage of choice  Many  many sobernauts swear by it  It probably should be the official beverage as much as it is talked about here   Terrific post  Congrats on your sober journey around the sun  Well said  Congrats on the year  Checking in  Thank you so much  Your response was helpful and supportive  and truly helped me when I was feeling alone and frustrated  I've definitely cooled off and think I'm in a better place emotionally  to handle this  I really appreciate your advice about how to frame the discussion so it's less about attacking him and more about how it affects me  Subscribed to the alanon subreddit as well  Thanks and happy new year    The victim stage of addiction is simply put the point at which you tell yourself I'm the worst  I can't do this  I don't want to go on  You basically think of yourself as a victim of yourself and your addiction  You likely blame others too  If you have a gf wife  you might tell yourself  she won't do this for me  she doesn't understand  I need this  It is also the stage which your addictions thrive  The drug that makes you claw at your skin  That porno telling you I will make you feel better  You are most susceptible to your impulses  The victim stage is only bad if you live in it  Which many do for years   You should tell people you trust  But remember if they make fun of you or judge you  they're only human  Some aren't going to believe it can even be addictive  Sex porn  especially porn  can be seen as a fake copout addiction    I know the feeling of denial and feeling like I'm hiding and being scared others will find out  Freaking out that I forget to clear my browsing history    Remember though addiction isn't cured  it is forgotten  The further you get away from it the less of a victim of addiction you are feel  You stop being an addict  But it is a lifetime of vigilance  you can start being an addict again with a single click  People on here and in life can go one year  two years  ten years and have a moment of weakness and binge  Basically be back to where they started    Have you thought of looking for sex porn addicts meetings support groups around Victoria  If you're looking for non medical  professional assistance    That's so kind of your husband to 'give' you the month of January   So then you can 'take' the months of February  March etc etc       People who love drinking don't like someone sober being around because it makes them feel uncomfortable  5 days sober after starting a Day 0 thread   I am feeling fanfuckingtastic   Best decision I've ever made  Thanks  you're definitely right  I don't think what I have to say will even make much of a difference  honestly  but I think it's important that I express where I'm at  Maybe some part of it will resonate  I'll have to look into local alanon meeting options for myself as well  Thanks for the thoughtful and kind response  I really appreciate your advice  Happy new year   I'm having very much the same thoughts  Just chiming in   The holidays seem to be a rough time  Congrats on not getting laid off  Sorry to hear about the 2 seizures though  that sucks a lot  Be careful bud  I hope it doesn't happen again  Just curious though is there any indication or warning for the seizure or do you just wake up out of it  I've had some nasty shakes sweating fear after bingeing and possibility of seizure is always in the back of my mind   I would spend around  30 a day  That gets you a good eighth in Maine  Funny enough  this state just legalized it and now I'm quitting  It's a funny thing about craving   I always said I didn't crave alcohol and "I could quit anytime "  Yet somehow at 6 pm every day a wine glass magically leapt from the cupboard to the counter and filled itself with wine   So while I said I didn't crave it  for over 10 years I never skipped it   I might skip a meal if feeling sickly  or talking to the family if I had a headache  but skip that glass and its 10 friends   Nope   What helped me at first other than my therapist was reading  posting and commenting like crazy here  reading This Naked Mind  and not saying no to ANY impulse other than drinking   Want to sleep at 8  Did it   Eat ice cream for dinner  Did it     You can do it   It sounds like you're being honest with yourself  that was my first step   Life gets so  so  so much better  fast   I will not drink with you today  I completely understand   I am so very angry at my alcoholic husband and what his addiction has done to our family  I hate it   I hate it   I hate it   I tried Alanon but I don't think I'll go back   The meeting I attended was full of very nice people who just kept going on about how you have to "fake it until you make it" regarding living with an alcoholic   In my opinion  that's what led to the disaster that is my life   Faking that everything is okay   Faking that he is not black out drunk   Faking that we are a happy family   Faking that he is not ignoring the children   Faking that he is a supportive partner   Maybe I misinterpreted the meeting   maybe I am totally off base  but I didn't like it   But   I understand your anger and if you just want to chat  you can PM me   I wish I could offer more   I do want to add that I am not criticizing Alanon   I absolutely know that it is very valuable and helpful to a heck of a lot of people   It just wasn't for me  Agreed  I've only finished day 1 and I'm already a miserable git  Me Nice  good suggestions  I love podcasts  will check them out   I am not drinking today  Same  Congrats Thank you for posting this  It gives me hope  Would look great  Sign me up please  Fantastic celebration list  Our NYE is always a happy day because we celebrate the year  my husband's birthday  and our wedding anniversary   There wasn't ice cream  but we did have cake   scratch angle food cake with whipped cream and a blueberry pure   so delicious  Try and view this "voice" as a the irritating lying ghost of your former addiction  And know and believe 100  that if you have one cigarette it will bring that addiction back some power  before you know it the asshole is back  This is more for the cravings and when you get passed one by someone  But do be aware that this is why you picked it back up before   Checking in  Happy and healthy wishes to you  I was alone and sober for NYE for the first time in decades  I was lonely and depressed  But I woke up sober and feel great about  We are close in our sober time and I struggled this weekend too  I was alone  it was a holiday and I had 3 days off  Prime drinking time  I'm glad you did not drink and I will not drink with you today  Happy New Year  It's In the info section for this sub it should be there sorry I'm not sure how to post a link directly but if you go to thisnakedmind com you should be able to download it for free at the moment   Happy New Year  Not drinking today  Will push through   I am not to sure but It might have something to do with how your lungs clean themselves after a month or so the coughing got pretty bad for me last time I quit  maybe do some googling on that  I guess I've been honest with myself for a long while now  It has literally been years since I admitted to myself that I don't have any control over alcohol  I guess I just need to be more honest with others around me   It feels so good to talk openly about what I'm thinking  I really appreciate the reply   this sub is  awesome   I will not drink with you too    I'm with you brother   Checking in  I'm also on day 1  Last night I took all my paraphernalia and threw it out  It really hurt because it cost me a lot of money but continuing to smoke weed everyday will cost me way more money in the long run    Like you said  I'm tired of being numb all the time  I also feel like I'm never truly happy anymore  I just live toke to toke  I need to get back my natural happiness because it shouldn't depend on a plant  Happy New Year  I did not give in to drinking last night and actually got to spend most of the evening at home reading a good book  And today  on a day of new beginnings  I will continue to choose not to drink   I got no texts either  Also recently ended a relationship  NYE just kind of amplified my feeling alone  I am trying to view this as a time to work on myself  get stronger in sobriety  increase my social contacts  work on my sprituality  focus on my health and mental health  Seems like the perfect time as I have zero distractions  Wishing you the best  Welcome  it's good to have you here  I can really relate to what you're saying  I am   was the same  It will be nice to bring in the new year clear headed with no memory blanks or regrets  This Naked Mind changed my mindset and life  it's a great place to start  I won't drink with you today Great Video I watched that myself just absolutely the most helpful clear explanation I have ever seen about quitting  just prepping my last attempt  will be successful     To all of you here at SD  I wish you all the best in the coming year  I hope  for each and every one of you  that this will be your most productive and healthy year to date  I'm not drinking with you on this glorious first day of 2017  Yes we can do this   My first NYE sober after 17 years  Feels amazing to be able to fully enjoy this day  Lets keep this goodwork    in Not today     I'm glad you are here  While the badge may be back at one  you most certainly are not  I find it helpful to amend each of my thoughts about how I messed up  my self talk is toxic  with something along the lines of     If I could have made a different choice  I would have  What is important is how I will prepare to make a different choice next time    Then I make a list of behaviors to choose from next time I find myself in a similar situation    I will not drink with you today   Breathe  distract yourself  do something nice for yourself  Hug your family  Cry  It does get better  Going to the Dr or ER may be an option as well to help with withdrawal  Last year was my most successful year  as far as sobriety goes  2017 will be even better  But for now  I'm just going to focus on today  and not drink   Wisconsin  the Restaurant I go to is in Sister Bay specifically  Welcome back  Nope  I wouldn't know anything about actual sex  But I do know swedish pancakes  I went out to a street party last night  We ate and danced and I didn't drink  Someone insistently gave me a cup with champagne in it "for the toast"  but I just poured it in someone else's cup  I laughed and jokes and just generally had a really great time  I fricking love sobriety   That's awesome  Glad you are here  I'm with you  Messed up last night  Back to it

New Year  filled with new possibilities from good choices  I will not drink with all of you today   You are doing a great job  I believe in you Like others here  I got that too  in the earliest days

back at you  Lee  Not today   and thank you all for being here  There were some inappropriately drunk people at our party for a few minutes last night  My daughter commented on it and how it made her

of days  Best of luck I hope to a lot of motivation form all the Resolution Quitters being a step in front of me  Dont fall for the substitutes they are a filthy scam  It is like swapping rum for vodka to quit you alcohol addiction   Hey I can totally relate  I dumped my buds down the toilet and was all I could think was the money going down the drain  But like you said  in the long run  it's an investment   Also can relate to living toke to toke  No way to live    Good luck and Happy New Year  Gonna pick some up at the store today xD Sign me up   I'm in   One day at a time  one month at a time  Let's make this 2017 something we will never forget  That's rough  does your SO know about you not drinking  Do they support you in your decision  I find it's good to say a positive reason for not drinking  I say "I realised I'm happier when I'm not drinking " and have found that works really well as my reason  Isn't it silly that we have to have a reason NOT to put poison in our bodies  I think it helps to have an escape plan  like if it's not going well from the beginning having my car there to leave and leave by myself  Another thing is when people still pressure me I tell them I have a drinking problem  It stops the pressure immediately  Good on you for coming back here straight away  sometimes a slip reminds us how unenjoyable drinking is an strengthens us  Let's not drink together today    Well I cant unpee what Ive pee on    Haha wise words to live by    Sign me up please    I'm tired of breaking my mutual promise with my partner to stop watching porn  I want to do this for myself and for him  but I need a way to further hold myself accountable  I believe this'll help big time  Thanks for your service   Night bagel made me lol  Thanks for the share   Checking in  ready to rid this terrible habit from my life  Just take it one day at a time  Day one  I am concerned as I think both at the same time might be a much bigger challange  To kill those two birds with one stone you will need a very large stone   I will not drink today  He doesn't drink and constantly digs about my drinking  When I stop he complains I'm "different"  I literally can't win  I actually told the host I have a problem and am going to AA  He laughed and passed me wine  Ugh  The wife then said "I don't trust people who don't drink" WTF    Welp you're already better at it then me  I started using cocaine with the ole Saying "if I'm buying it  I'm finishing it tonight" so now I could never let it sit in a drawer while I tried not to use it  of just be blowing through it  I feel ya on the whole not having a safe place to discuss it  But if youre able to have it and not do it  youre doing great  Happy New Year  I fell asleep reading at 10 PM  didn't even see it happen  That's common for me  however  Anyway  I will not drink with you today  Thank you for being here  SD  May you have a fantastic day  You got this  Keep coming back here and checking in  Thanks scotty everytime i do this i get a bit more determined to do something about it but everytime i think im getting round it after a few weeks i slip back to drinking i survived a severe brain injury and got myself walking and talking again but this anxiety fight dwarves it I won't drink with any of you today  What kind of shoes   Nice job  hope you keep winning in 2017   I plan to win with you  First non hungover New Years Day in 15 years  dating back to high school   No amount of guilt can change the past  And no amount of anxiety can change the future  Take it one day at a time  Focus on other things besides abstaining  Take on some hobbies  spend time with others and strengthen relationships  etc  You got this  don't let a minor thing effect the progress you made  We share a birthday   exactly  Happy 36 to us  2017 will be my first full year clear of mind  I'll not drink with you today sobernauts    I was just explaining this to my husband yesterday  how drugs and alcohol initially filled a void but eventually it took more than it gave  and made the void bigger in the end   Keep it up  Today can be the end of your misery and the start of your wonderfull life  There is never a point of no return  unless you kill someone and get life in jail or something or kill yourself  that's the end   No matter what problems you have now  YOU CAN OVERCOME THEM  You take one problem at the time on  and solve it   Your biggest problem right now  you are a porn addict  Everyone here struggles with the same problem  We are here for you   When you quit porn  you'll slowly become better  But it's not easy  it takes dedication  Hell  I've only been doing this for 8 days and every day I struggle to not relapse  People report benefits  I don't see them yet  But I trust it will happen  And I know for myself that I'm doing the right thing   So the question is not "have I gone over the point of no return "  but rather "How much effort am I willing to spend to get the life I want " You

together  I have heard similar and those people are generally wanting a drinking buddy  so they don't have to take a good hard look in the mirror   I have found that I need people in my life that are supportive of my sobriety  It makes it all work easier  Happy New Year Guys  Another bloody reset for me  but at least I didn't drink last night  so no hangover today   Today I will so absolutely be NOT drinking with you all  Have a good day everyone  x Same here    I was so nervous  I thought we'd just pop in for a couple hours and then bail    we wound up staying for six hours  had a ton of fun with my friends as they got drunk  took care of my kids so my wife could socialize with her friends  The funniest part was I had concocted cranberry juice and soda water as my "drink" for the night  people just assumed I was drinking the "adult" punch  no pressure to explain that I wasn't drinking and all of that  Starting off the new year with a bit of a cold  Definitely not drinking today  Have a great new year all  Stay strong  Just remember if you  weren't  sober  that would be just one more thing in your life you wished was different  You're on the right track  The hosts sound like absolute assholes  This whole situation is making me mad for you  I'm sorry I'm not sure what to say because I'm trying to speak from the "I"     I would not be happy with my SO    What can you do in

22   me too and why was it always 3 00  it's like universal  Day 2  again  here  and happy to join you in not drinking today  x Thank you  And congratulations on day 37    It feels good to finally admit that I had a problem and feels even better to be doing something about it    My housemates had a party last night and it was so nice to be able to clean up all the mess this morning before any of them had even stirred  I'm not usually the most considerate roommate   I feel improved already   My mom had an experience like that when she was a kid but she won't talk about it  We've tried everything  Counseling  rehab  in patient therapy  The only time she brings it up is when she's drunk around me    Taking her to therapy is an excellent option  See if the therapist will allow you to sit in on one of the first sessions so you can tell your mom why you're so worried  The therapist may also have family counseling options available   I have been in your shoes and it's an uncomfortable place to be  My understanding is  with couples therapy and much communication  some people are able to carry on being sober with a spouse who drinks  I personally could not    In October of this year I moved out of my marital home and in December my divorce was finalized  He is still my best friend but I am an alcoholic in recovery  and he's an alcoholic in denial   The decision was difficult but necessary  for me  I had to decide to put sobriety before each and every thing in my life  because if I had gone back to drinking  I would have lost everything anyway   As an alcoholic I am a great actor  I can put on a good face and I can even fool those around me sometimes when I am drinking  But they don't know how deeply miserable and out of control I feel when I am drinking  I don't know about the cravings and the obsession and the guilt remorse and shame  So even if others think they like me better when I drink  I DON'T  like myself when I drink  And ultimately  that is what matters  I tried chocolate peppermint tea for NYE  Delish  There is no luck buddy  only choices  it gets so good the choice will be clear but not easy  wishing you the best man   I will not drink today  Yes  That's great   My kind off New year's eve   A couple of weeks ago my husband and I were going through an extremely rough patch  Like to the point he left and I was left alone with only my thoughts and I think the best decision I ever made was not drinking during that time  It would have made me feel so much worse and made me do or say things I regret   I know how hard break ups are  They are all consuming  especially if you are the one who has been broken up with   Please take care of yourself during this rough time  I will not be drinking with you today     I like to think that my newfound sobriety beginning March of last year was lead in practice for a much better year this year  and truly there are amazing differences in me  this  morning versus the morning of 01 01 2016     Raises coffee cup high  Here's to hope and change we all on SD can believe in  Happy New Year  us all   Virtual clinks  I'm with you  I was surrounded by close friends and family that were drinking quite a bit  Not only did they not care  they fully supported me throughout the night  I had a great time and feel great the day after   which hasn't happened in over a decade  The brain is plastic  meaning we can change it  It is never to late to recreate ourselves  you just need to take it one day at a time  The good thing about hitting rock bottom is you are basically hitting a point that you know you have a problem and you despise the problem  Now you need a strategy to beat it   My current strategy is to only make it through today  I don't care about tomorrow  next week  streaks  etc  I just need to survive today  We are excellent procrastinators so when I have the urge to watch I just procrastinate from watching it till the urge subsides  We only have so much willpower so I'm making sure to use it for this addiction  I want to improve other areas of my life  but first I want to get this under control before I use my willpower for other things   You are not beyond getting healed  I have read success stories from people on way worse conditions than you that have beat this  We have the power to overcome this  the only thing that sucks is this shit will be in the back of our minds for the rest of our lives  We just have to get to a point where those urges don't do anything to us    Don't give up buddy  Good morning  SD  Waking up rested on New Years Day is never gonna grow old  I will not drink today  Wishing you all a happy and sober 2017  Hey kool  Congratulations  Very true Day 3 for me  This sub has been crucial to me these past 72 hours  I check in here every time the the struggle overwhelms  So pleased to have found it   My friends who were fully supportive of my recovery  help me find other ways to connect with them  He is where my real friends  the ones who cared about me beyond the Barfly that sat beside them  So  we went to movies  and restaurants  and had game night  and found other ways to spend time together and have fun away from alcohol   The people who only had a bottle in common with me  the people I went to the bar and sat with us I got drunk and I thought we're such good friends   those people faded away  When times got rough and life handed me lemons  they were busy putting lemons in their vodka while I stayed sober   I also found it useful to get involved in the recovery community  and through meetings and Alcoholics Anonymous  I've developed a brand new network of friends  I learned how to have fun without alcohol  it took a while but it was worth it   "If you want to know who your real friends are  get sober " Welcome back QB   As far as I'm concerned  you never left   Practice makes perfect   Happy New Years Dude  One day at a time  Welcome  I will not drink with you today  I flew across the country yesterday and now I'm jet lagged  It feels kind of like a hangover  Possibilitarian has a sober birthday today  Thank you  runnermansud  You are to blame for my success this time around  Thanks for the recommendation to download the 30 Day book  It's helped me immensely   Going for a run soon to listen to day 8    Anyway  congrats on your sober NYE  I did something similar with my 9 year old son  only root beer floats  and we didn't quite make it anywhere near midnight    Anyway  congratulations  May you have a most wonderfully  fulfilling  hangover free day     Perfect  Congratulations  Week one was an absolute blur of emotions  Yep  I'm awesome  so I won't drink today with you also      Happy New Year  I won't drink with you today  Nice  isn't it  Thank you  Happy New Year  Same boat for me  I was at two weeks then drank on Christmas and then drank a couple of days ago  Badge reset  I'm ready   well badge hasn't been reset  but I requested it to be     You got this  Happy New Year  See you here tomorrow  Strong work on 2 years  Congratulations   Hey Mom  Happy New Year  I did it    Can't say I was in the best mood all evening  but I didn't drink so I'm in a good mood now    I will not drink today  And to you  too  I may stay in my pjs all day today  Nothing like being sober and comfy  Happy New Year  Good morning and happy New year  one and all  I will not drink today no matter what gets thrown my way  Happy New Year  See you here tomorrow  Me too  I managed a few stints in 2016  I'll not drink with you today  and yeah  here's to a sober 2017  x About  5 to  7 a day  But between buying vapes and accessories all the time it works out to much more than that per day  Thank you  Happy New Year  Welcome  Good luck    Happy New Year  shine  I will not drink today   Whenever you feel urge remind yourself how you feel now  It helps a lot to prevent further relapses  Ha  Thank you  It's not as thick as it looks  it's actually pretty fine  I just have a LOT of it  But thanks    You are an alcoholic  The inability to control ones drinking is the description of an alcoholic  I am a binge type alcoholic meaning once I start I cannot stop  I was not physically dependant on alcohol and didn't need an assisted detox  binge drinking is psychological  Just because you don't drink every day or you don't drink in the mornings doesn't mean you do not have a problem and doesn't make us better than alcoholics that do  Our problems just manifests in different ways and is actually the gateway to this type of drinking   The scary thing is most people who drink can't control it  Keep on Truckin'  Exactly this    And   if you were drunk the sadness and crying would be cranked up to 11    I got no texts and have been questioning how many of my friends were really drinking buddies  Let's get through this together  and come out stronger and with more friends   Hang in there  Annie  Happy New Year to all the SD community    Just for today let us all NOT drink together     Checking in  getting 2017 started off right  Craving today   but not drinking with you fine folks Thanks  Tracey  I'll check them out       I was told to I needed to stop  letting my control issues interfere with my treatment when I was inpatient  so I was hesitant to bring up the diagnosis with treatment team at home because I didn't want them to think my ED was in control again and I was being non compliant  I did speak with my therapist about it and explained my thoughts and feelings  We're working through it  It still bothers me  but not nearly as much as it did before   Right  She kissed me  I didn't push anything  I'm typically more aggressive sexually but bc of what she said previously I questioned it and the response was ambiguous based on the history of our communication  What I am dealing with is a dry drunk  It's manipulation I'm thinking  I hope you can too  Hang in there  x Ok   lets not drink today  I'm going out tonight on the town still as I'm on holiday and need to make it up to my other half after ruining NYE  Let's all check in tomorrow and say how we've done   I guess we all need a bit of a plan though   I will not drink today   Thanks SD  I'm here  ready to do this  I might enjoy it more   you never know   No better time than the first day of a new year  Good luck  x Congrats on a year sober   so happy for you  The drinking age in England is 18 which means most kids start drinking at 15  Scary stuff  Happy New Year Lee  Don't try and quit forever   Just try and quit for a day  Then  quit for another day   If you get high or drunk  start over if you want   There is no dead line to this and looking at like you have to quit forever today is too big  it sets you up for failure   Gotta take it one little bit at a time   If a day at a time is too big  do it hour by hour   When you are ready to quit  you'll know because you'll want to quit and it won't work until you are ready to quit    Above all  be kind to yourself and to don't put too much preasure on yourself to succeed   Easy does it   No rush  you have the rest of your life to get this right  Today is a new day   I am not drinking today  Girl  believe me    I am not pressuring her  As a woman myself I am listening   One day at a time  Focus on making it through today and overtime that counter will grow  Soot paying attention to streaks and abstaining  Instead focus on becoming the greatest version of yourself  This addiction is no joke as we all know  So we must take it seriously  Don't give up  There are many people who have very many different opinions on this  I personally have eliminated alcohol in all forms from my life  That includes mouthwash  Nyquil with alcohol  etc     As for cooking with alcohol  there are many alternatives  If you cooked professionally you know you can certainly use stocks or other liquids instead of alcohol   For me personally  here is my thought on it  why do we cook with alcohol  For the flavor  I'm an alcoholic  the last thing I need is the flavor of alcohol  It doesn't matter what the alcohol by volume proof amount is after the product is cooked  a mouthful of wine flavor reminds me of the real thing  It is a choice I have made in support of my sobriety    Some people aren't quite as stringent about it and they have no problem  Others find that it is a slippery slope  Just like recovery in general  there is no one correct answer  You can do it  Three days ago I was you  Today I feel my best self in years  Best of luck  I'm here for you   I will not drink today  I'll take a coffee hangover over a booze hangover any day of the week and twice on Sunday    Me too  High five  Yes  this times a million  My image of drinking in my mind and the reality of it could not be more different  When I think about drinking it's in a cosy pub by a log fire chatting with a good friend while slowly sipping a glass of wine  It's never happened  Reality  Drinking two bottles of wine a night and practically gulping down the first while hiding empties from my wife  Next morning I'm shaking and sweating while desperately not trying to be sick   That old image in my mind needs to go  You're back here  that's what matters now  Keep at it  I will not drink today  It's amazing to think about where my head was a year ago versus today  I'm excited to see what 2017 has in store  Happy New Year    No one else "cared"  I have usually found this to be the case  I was lucky to get this lesson on night 2  and it was a huge confidence builder reinforcing that I was pursuing sobriety for me    Have a great 2107  It's a great feeling any day but it's especially nice on the first day of the new year  Congrats  I will not drink with you today as well    Just possession thankfully  I guess I'm kind of lucky because it's my first offense  and my lawyer said that I'll probably just be on probation for 6 months and if I do everything right than I won't have the conviction on my record  It's definitely a way more expensive process than I thought   The day after I hit 5 months sober  my spouse at the time was diagnosed with aggressive cancer  By keeping in touch with other people in recovery  and actively using a support system built of friends  family  and professionals  I survived it and stayed sober  Other challenges have come along in the years and months since then   and it has most certainly never been easy  But I know I need to stay sober no matter what  and a drink isn't going to help any challenge I am facing  You certainly should be proud of yourself  It's amazing how our lives consisted on drinking and when we can drink  It's a merry go round I needed off  Congratulations on looking deep and wanting off too  Sometimes looking at are selves is the hardest first thing to do during recovery  Good Luck you got this   Not drinking today   Nice  Congrats on your year and lovely transformation  inside to out  https   youtu be nabO UXb6MM  Elliott Smith   Fond Farewell   "Pitch burning on a shining sheet The only maker that youd wanna meet"  So many relatable lines in the song Feeling great today   Made it through party weekend  Watching SO with a massive headache today makes me feel great about my work this weekend  Next big test will be getting through a big presentation at work on Wednesday  Lots of anxiety building up about it  How you doing shonky  I will not drink today  I spent all of 2016 sober  and my plan is to be able to say the same thing about 2017 a year from now  But I will always take it one day at a time   Congrats  Thanks for your honesty  it's not all roses    you're an inspiration to me  Will not drink today   Happy New Year everyone  I just turned down a line of blow for the first time in years Happy New Year  Welcome  I can share with you what I've learned from managing my diet now that I've eliminated booze from the equation  The missing intake of all the calories and sugar from alcohol is obviously big  BUT  in my humble opinion it's the sober food decisions you'll make that makes the difference  For example  you are way less likely to order a burger and fries on a Saturday night at a restaurant when you're sober  On the flip side drunk me was always like fuck it  another slice please  After a year I was down over 40 pounds  It was the easiest weight I've ever lost  Im a life long weight fluctuator but staying sober has made it SO much easier to keep the weight off    As for tips I'd say to remember this one  One day at a time  Sounds like a cliche AA thing right  That's what I thought at first too  However it really works  If you think about not drinking again forever it can be very overwhelming  But not drinking just for today is much easier  I'm not going to drink with you today   Congrats on  7  you shit show     100 days today  Got a good night's sleep and was thrilled to go to bed sober  I will not drink today  Today is one of those days when I realize just how thankful I am to wake up sober and without a hangover  I'll carry this thankfulness with me through today and not drink  At least get a stripper than can lick her own balls  I will not drink today  no matter what happens  Happy New Year Everyone and Best Wishes for 2017 on a Not Drinking Today New Years Day   Been there done that  At my girlfriends and my apartment on the futon  Many times  So shameful  BUT  that's all over now and forever  I won't drink with you today  I'm no drug and alcohol counselor  but I have a feeling if you are this concerned about becoming an alcoholic based upon that amount frequency of getting drunk  and you realize the negatives it has caused you  you likely would not allow yourself to blindly progress into severe alcoholism  You seem very aware of the nature of your relationship with it  which is leaps and bounds past where I was at way back when my problem was a 1 2 day per month binge to get drunk  I didn't fully realize I had an issue until I was drinking nearly every day  That said  what you describe is exactly how I started down the road to daily hard drinking  many years later  Force yourself to stay aware that it is not necessarily a "harmless" path  even if it is a completely socially acceptable level of drinking in your circle of friends and or family  Good luck  I'm with you  let's do it   Kind of like my top comment  Who even says "Oh my shit"  I kinda remember drinking election night  Feeling fresh too  and yes it does feel bloomin' awesome   Happy New Year to you x   Hope you stick around Yoga  As Cheese says  it's nice here  You are among friends  x Yeah  I am going to hit a beach meeting and then the Alcathon at the club in Englewood  Florida   Seems that will be a reasonable way to start a year  Tired of the random bruises  Not remembering how they got there or why  Did I fall  Maybe  When I was detoxing I lost my sense of balance so badly I couldn't even stand at the toilet straight enough to piss  I'd fall backwards into the closet door  Never want to experience that again  Keep it up chief   It can creep up out of nowhere  Remember that those beautiful memories under starry skies were you and the people and nature  The cigarettes just happened to be there  I wish you strength   you can keep building beautiful moments without them  I won't drink today  I survived last night and went to bed sober  I'm doing that again tonight  Happy New Year  I will not drink with you today  Happy New Year to all of you amazing  inspiring people  I won't drink today either     This sub is definitely awesome   It gave me my life back    Maybe stop worrying about "stopping for all time" and focus just on this day  or this hour  "All time" is a bit much for anyone to comprehend  especially a scared part of you  Wishing you the best  Shit yeah  Keep it the f up  Incredible story  Thanks so much for sharing  You look great  it's always most noticeable in the eyes  there's so much life there now   I love that you mentioned getting your endorphin from the gym  I haven't had to convince myself to workout since quitting because that natural good feeling is such a stress reducer    Congrats and Happy New Year  I did it  I masturbated without porn at 7am because I know I wouldn't fall asleep for another 10 hours  just like the previous 10 hours  Awesome   Have a warm and cozy day  I'm so glad you made that decision   Even though I have over two months sober now  I have the same 24 hours to get thru today that you do   We're going to do it together  and be better for it tomorrow   I won't drink with you today  I'll join you in that  Harry  x Welcome and good luck in January and going forward   My resolution   Time to put down the cigs    sigh Congrats  I'm on day 39 today and agree with the fact that life is much better without it  I feel so much better than I did a couple months ago as well  Happy new year mate  It is very simple  Just take it one day at a time  Focus less on abstaining and more on improving yourself  The more time spent on other things the less time you have for porn  Good luck  Happy new year  everyone  No drinking for me today  this week  this month OR this year  Hope 2017 is the best year yet for you all  Can't wait  Wow  January 1st and I'm not hung over  I will not drink with you today  I will not drink today  I remember every detail  hubs gave me a kiss at midnight  we stayed in   I got up early  gave mom a shower and got her cleaned up  then did a a short yoga practice  I feel awesome      I was 21  and it was normal to drink like that  Right      and then at 30  because I'm still young  right      and then at 35  because I'm not as bad as my friends  right   You totally made the right call   Congratulations on 23 days  That's amazing  I love the idea of dong things I've never done before in 2017  I may have to steal that  Happy New Year  I had almost the exact same situation happen with friends  and most shockingly at the time  my ex husband  It was during one of my many short term attempts at sobriety over the years  Looking back it makes me realize how many of my friends were just "good time" bar friends and not real relationships and friendships  As far as my ex husband goes  he had his own very deep rooted alcoholism to deal with that he never wanted to  and through the grapevine as I hear  still never has   The hardest thing is to feel like you are making a change that you so desperately want to make for your self  and the people around you don't want to support  or make jabs  or flat out say things like they like you better you are more fun when you are drinking  All I can say is try and be strong and don't buckle to the pressure or let the comments get in your head  You have to do what you know will make you happiest and feel the best  I forgot about this post  this is actually worthy of a post in and of itself if you think about it     Happy KRATOM FREE New Year  That sounds like an amazing weekend  This was my first year too since about the same age  Last year I decided I wouldn't go out to a party and instead drank alone for the evening and slept all through Jan 1  Today is an awesome change    Congrats and happy new year  Day five was the hardest for me  Keep up the good fight  Oh how I don't miss having to send those texts  or apologize for stuff I don't remember   Congratulations on 3 months  Split from my partner 3 years ago on the 4th of Jan  I know that pain  we were together 7 years and have a son  It really hurt  drinking didn't help the hurt go away  Only in sobriety have I learnt to deal with stuff that previously I would have hidden under a cloak of drunkenness    I am so glad for you  that you have not picked up a drink  I will join you in not drinking today  together we are stronger  many hugs x  Yup  Glad you have the strength to make it 51 days  I relapsed two times after joining this sub  I hope this time I won't touch the booze for good  Your words helped Thank You

worth it   Good luck   happy  kratom free  2017   Yes  I've had those memories pop up on the Facebook that don't even involve a party and I think  "Hmmm  I wonder     Was I half drunk or was the anxiety spiking with a hang over    yuck "  It could have been neither  but the question is always there   Time to make new memories   Best wishes with your new memories and the 23 days   I'll happily not drink with you today    Slept in today  but not due to a hangover  Happy New Year's everyone and I will not drink today  I will not drink today no matter what happens  You might really enjoy the

for so long  I'm amazed at your strength and ability to carry on  You might think at times you're weak  but that just isn't so  Even in the darkest of times you're clinging desperately to life all whilst it's doing its best to shake you off  You are ridiculously brave and strong  It might not mean much  but I believe in you  And I'm so so proud of you for fighting  If you ever need anyone to talk to  I'm always around  Please don't hesitate to reach out  I hope 2017 is as amazing as you are  It was not a mistake  you're correct   Also there isn't really anything for you to agree or

what I'm grateful for   And no drinking  no matter what  you good dude  don't stress  just slip that under the rug and keep on chuggin  props for not falling back into it too heavy  happy new years   I have a suggestion regarding the title   instead of "victor" perhaps the term "hero" would fit better   since  "Victor"  a person who defeats an enemy or opponent in a battle  game  or other competition  Example  "congratulations to the victors"  The people beat the challenge  and technically the ones who failed  but that is a bit of a negative spin  Since we are more like a band of brothers  and sisters  fighting a war against evil   And a hero is defined as   1  a person noted for courageous acts or nobility of character  He became a local hero when he saved the drowning child  2  a person who  in the opinion of others  has special achievements  abilities  or personal qualities and is regarded as a role model or ideal   The people that beat the challenge should be regarded as role models and persons who have achieved something we all aspire to   So I would propose  "CONGRATULATIONS TO THE   HEROES   OF THE STAY CLEAN 2016 YEAR LONG CHALLENGE "  and december challenge     You guys are real role models and heroes for having completed this challenge Thank you  I made it  Have a headache from crying but feel better   Happy New Year my friend  Thank you  I will check that channel out today  Happy New Year  That's awesome  I actually went to a convention last night and sat in 4 meetings  My social anxiety made it tough after a full day so I ended up going home at 10 before the dance started  I feel lame for leaving so early but hey  I didn't drink   Happy Birthday    I raise my LaCroix to you  Happy 2017  No problem    I am  The anxiety is down quite a bit  Still shaky and a bit disoriented but starting to get there    For victims of violence and crime  Not exactly witness protection  although there are women here going into witsec   Count me in and SIGN ME UPPPPP I was finding empties hidden everywhere  luck  Thanks  Happy New Years QB  You're almost at half a year  And for those thinking of relapsing trust me when I say you're not missing anything   I will not drink today   Happy new year  I won't drink today  thanks y'all  Yeah I read somewhere that if you are not into going to the meetings  which I'm not  you can recondition your mind yourself  You have to treat your alcoholic brain as a separate to your sober brain  And remember that your sober brain is always in control as long as you don't have a drink  and learning to tell your alcoholic brain no  eventually it gets smaller and smaller until it is hardly heard  it sounds daft but has pretty much worked for me   so far   what a great story   Congrats  Sign me up  Alcoholism is a progressive disease and if you are an alcoholic it WILL get worse  you will drink more  and more often  possibly becoming a daily drinker  As a person who drank too much I looked at others and said "at least i'm not as bad as THAT person  he's really got a problem there"    I went to A A  because I knew I had a problem with alcohol and after listening to other people describe the progression and their problems I was able to see that although not a daily drinker and even able to not drink for periods of time   I AM an alcoholic  I am grateful that I was able to accept the truth and then start doing what I had to do to live with my alcoholism  Many people come to meetings  hear exactly what I heard  feel as I felt  but because of fear or denial go back to drinking and try to control it and some take many years and a viscious beating from their addictions before they are ready to accept help  It is a choice each one of us has to make on our own  nobody else can make it for me  A A  members know this mental trap well because everybody has had to get past it to stay sober and there is lots of help and encouragement for new people coming in  If you think you have a problem with alcohol  and if somewhere  in the back of your mind a quiet little voice says "you might be an alcoholic" then do yourself a favour  spend an hour and go to an open meeting of A A  and listen to the experience  strength and hope being shared there and If you find yourself saying "I'm just like them    I've felt just like that  Oh my god  I thought I was the only one " then admitting you are an alcoholic is not so bad because you are not alone and there is a solution  And if you are not an alcoholic then you had a lousy free coffee and met some weird people you don't relate to at all and you can say " at least i'm not as bad as THOSE people  from the sounds of it  they really shouldn't drink"      Yeah I'm pretty sure I got married last night   I vaguely remember anything but it sounds like I had a great time   And I guess there was a boy but I lost him   along with one sock and my shoes   So I just walked home with one sock and someone's slippers Haha  Are they  your  shoes  though  Even at 4months your glow was incredible  Congrats   What people post on social media  is often a fake  'best representation' of themselves and what they are doing YOU have done it  last night you did it and you should be proud of yourself  being sober is worth it    It does get better  Take care  I won't drink with you today   Sign me up lets do this  Listen a lot  Take the good  leave the bad   Start some new friendships  get a sponsor   And go to different meetings   some are better than others    Also   detox can be deadly  See a doctor and be honest in your drinking   Brand new to this been looking for a while here it goes   I will not drink today  how do I get a badge    It feels great to actually see a new years as an adult and not be wasted  In our entire adult lives we have not been sober on new years  Crazy huh  Yo  Swedish pancakes are super simple to make on your own though  and try eating them with vanilla ice cream and Strawberry jam  there ain't nothing better   Source  am Swedish   That's nice to hear  thanks  I intend to make this a lasting change and will be sticking around   x I will not drink today It's awesome isn't it  About to head out with the family to one of our favorite parks for a picnic  Had I drank I would be on the couch right now feeling miserable and maybe even sneaking in more alcohol to "cure" the hangover   Congratulations all  Congratulations    It's a wonderful feeling to not have it on the list of things you want to improve Thanks  nice to get your reply  Looking forward to being part of this community   Happy New Year

need it  I think the same thing  One month done  I will not drink today    Hey I'm just catching up on last nights posts and saw yours  How are you doing today  Any better  I spent the night crying til I fell asleep  I wanted to drink so badly  I don't know why  Cause I'm alone I guess  The Husband could not have picked a worse time to be gone    I will be ok  No matter how fucking cold it is outside  I am taking my new pedometer for a brisk walk  Happy New Year  Woah  I'm not sure how your marriage is otherwise but I would take  that as a red flag  My partner lightly drinks but drinks a lot less since I've been attempting to stop and has been super supportive  If you can't have your significant other  who you live with and spend the most time with in your life be you rock  who will

I'll do the Humpty Dance with you  yeAH DRUGS were a boomerang that came back around and cut me the shreds   Glad to be free   and maybe even sneaking in more alcohol to "cure" the hangover     Oh boy can I relate to this  One of the many illogical excuses I gave myself to continue on my path of self destruction  Enjoy your hangovers free picnic  Seems like an example of sour grapes  your goal is right but your means of achieving it are wrong   I still go out with friends  but not to bars or anyplace where drinking is the main event  We do dinners  brunches  coffee dates  etc  Last night I was out and about at places where drinking wasn't the only "thing" to do  For me  it's important to still have a social life with the people that respect my choices and boundaries  I am lucky to have friends that drink normally  Last night they had a glass of wine with dinner and half a glass of champagne at midnight  What   I was happy to sober  they didn't care and no one got sloppy  Happy New Year   Made it     I've been miserable drunk  and I've been miserable sober   I remember a lot of shitty New Year's in my 15 years of alcoholism   I don't think I ever had a date for one  and I've spent many alone   For me  all sobriety offers is a chance  one of two paths   I know where the alcoholic one leads  I've been down it so many times   I haven't been down this one   I don't know if it will lead to happiness  being with someone I love  the magic kiss on New Year's we were all promised   I think there's a possibility it might   I know the other one doesn't   That one ends in misery   All I know about this path is I don't know where it goes   I wish you much happiness in the future   I have a feeling you'll find it  I will not drink today  no matter what happens  30 35 hours is nothing compared to some people here  me   I put in 120 hours over 2 weeks  55 of which were in dota 2  I don't do anything else with my life and that's why I decided to stop  Welcome back  I've recently had a reset too  I'm glad I'm back with you because sober feels so good   I bought some shitty looking wing tips at a thrift store for  30   The plan is to try to restore them or strip them and dye them blue     Last night I was trying to figure out what there are   The markings are all pretty much illegible     Turns out their an old shoe called British Walkers   I can't tell when they stopped making shoes because there is a new company by the same name    Here's the before and after so far with a little bit of cleaning on the left shoe   http   imgur com SkmqrjJ I'm where you were   It looks like a long way from here   Good luck with the nightmares lol  happy new year  Get out of your comfort zone you been in for so long  I know the feeling  If you come home  sit on the couch and normally start with a couple of beers  Than dont sit on the couch  help the wife to cook  play with the kids  clean up the garden  just set your mind for something else  I really needed to find another "addiction" and ended up in the gym on a daily basis  That worked for me for some time sorry if that was the impression given   Ahhhh  I see   my second click was on http   www baltimoreaa org

my yam bag against her ass cheeks for her to have had that kind of time    Thanks OP P   You've got this  I find if I get a craving and can distract myself for twenty minutes or so  that it passes   Sometimes I have to commit to not drinking for just 30 more minutes to work my way to another day   Also  check out r stopdrinking and if anybody tells you anything today  it should be this   You will never again have to feel the way you do right now  All  The  Time   I know     It's actually quite awesome that they called you  You must be an amazing aunt  Nicely done    I love your name  Glad to have you here   Welcome    Dry december completed  I will not drink with you today on the first of the year   I told my parents last night as well  Good luck to you  waking up this morning without my morning smoke was tough  but I'm ready for the battle  Happy Sober New Year  I look forward to congratulating you at your six month mark which is right around the corner  I will not drink today with you  We can do this  if you can make it 50 days  you can make it 5000 days   Welcome  We're glad your here too  Happy New Year  whyquit com had been very useful for me for quitting smoking What a great post  Sobriety does give us and them wonderful gifts of being loving humans  I won't drink with you today   I went to a friend's house for a party and left my kids home with my husband who all fell asleep at 8  I got home about 2  I was able to stop a couple from drunk driving with their kids in the car   I drove them home instead  I got home and curled up in bed with my son  I had promised him I would have a sleep over with him  and noticed when I got in bed the room was not spinning and I didn't have to get up all throughout the night to throw up or have explosive stomach issues   Best of all I was able to wake up with my kids and make them breakfast with no nausea or headache and am not irritable  We are watching Harry Potter as a family   It's so different from my nights of drinking  It was odd watching all my friends getting drunk throughout the night but The drunker everyone became the more grateful I was to not be fucked up  Plus there is a freedom in knowing I can do or say anything and no one will remember anything tomorrow   I still am told a lot how I didn't really have a problem  asked why did I stop  am told I didnt drink anywhere near as much as everyone else so I could not have had issues etc   but I would just shrug and not give a fuck   How great is that   You are the cool aunt  nice moniker  Awesome  Sounds like a perfect day   Congratulations on one week  I found that one to be the hardest   Recently I saw the following retort on here  or something to this effect   "We like you better when you drink " "I like you better when I drink  too " Whether or not someone actually wants to say it to your close family friends  it makes me laugh to imagine   That sucks about your husband and friend  It seems to me that 1  they enjoy drinking with you and are worried about losing that  I was one of those people who felt like I bonded better with people when we were drinking  I'm sure I was wrong  but that was a belief I really had   2  they want to make you feel bad insecure  the implication of their comments being that that they don't like you now and you could lose them  so that you'll drink with them  and or 3  they don't like what your stopping drinking says  in their minds  about their own drinking    To answer your question   I haven't yet had that experience with other people  What I can say is that when I was online dating while still drinking  and I saw that someone said they didn't drink  I was like  "NOOOOO " Because I wanted to keep Getting Drunk as one of my main extracurricular activities  and they didn't fit into that interest of mine  So my aversion to dating a non drinker was really about wanting to keep drinking a focal point of my life  It was about me  not about them   However  even if your husband's and friend's behaviors are rooted in their own feelings and are not about you  it's still a dick move to say those things   Pretty gnarly NYE  emotionally speaking  Stayed sober  but now I have a cold  Most definitely not drinking  Happy 2017 everyone  Ah  but you were strong on the inside  too  Great job  Happy New Year  In celebration of 2017  I will remain sober today    You can do it       Congratulations on winning yesterday's fight  Happy New Year  Literally the first thing I thought about when I woke up  So glad to be sober  iDoneDo thank you for hosting  My second day sober  I will not drink with you all today  Thanks  Thank you  Hey startwalking  I'm with you at 55 days  SD is my go to friend when I need an understanding confidant  Congratulations and Happy New Year  sign me up  I do it all the time  no worries   bud  I just did it yesterday   to my gf  That girl doesn't know it yet  but she is so gonna marry me   Dunno if it's a drunk thing  or if I'm just a hopeless romantic   But ya  when I get super slammed  all I think about is getting married  I have always wanted to be  and had a few close calls  but I could never afford the ring ceremony   Welcome  This is

the inspiring post  After 16 years I too saw the light and have accepted that drinking is no longer for me in any way  That one mindset change has taken sobriety from a chore to a delight  I wish you

That's amazing  You really could've saved a bunch of lives there by offering to drive  How sad that some people will endager their kids lives    alcohol is such a poison  How inspiring  You rock  How do I get the star and days by my name    What causes seizures is it not having enough alcohol in your system just makes your stomach spaz out or what  Happy New Year Ripster  I've been watching your

horses back much longer  Good luck to you as well  LET'S DO THIS     Fucken'a  Brink  Organisms and getting Fucken up is what life is all about   And ya  restaurant work is very conductive to both  Sorry you're hurting  I am  too  after my spine surgery  but meh  Finally found an rx that helps and mixes well with booze   But it sounds like you're doing it right  Just cum and drink through the pain  I am right there with you  One love  Your post sums up my thoughts perfectly   Have a great new year  I'm not drinking today  no matter what happens   Checking in  Good luck to everyone  Congrats and Happy New Year  With your 90   51 days  you were sober for  at least  39  of 2016  Not too shabby  Focus on having healthy relationships with my family members  namely my mother  Get back to doing yoga daily and making it a point to find something to be thankful for in each and every day   Wow   That is great   Congrats on one year    Sign me up  I must have signed up for the January instead of the year long by mistake  Regardless  I'm here  Can vouch for Galapentin  That's what I'm taking after my spine surgery for nerve pain  It mixes well with booze  too  I went vegan on New Years day 7 years ago and lost 30 pounds in the first 60 days  Never looked back  I'll tell you  the best thing that happened when my husband ran away for someone else on the 1st day of my sobriety is  I have been able to handle it with more self respect   greater strength than if I'd been drinking  I was able to see things clearly much faster  no drunken texts  emails or embarrassing calls to recover from  and somewhere along the way  I regained my sense of self worth  I'll not drink with you on that     I'm not drinking today  That's sounds like fun  and I'm so  so glad about the book but of course you're to credit for your success  Happy New Year my friend   You can do this  Keep remembering  nothing gets better with booze  It is like sticking your head in the sand  sooner or later you have to come out for air  you might as well smell the roses  Now THATS a party  Sounds great and Happy New Year  Look in the sidebar on the right to request a badge  Welcome    Sign me up

Let's continue and make 2017 even better   Checking in     I love your optimism but that is quite a goal to set  let's go for 60 first  A manageable goal  small steps   I will not drink with you today  "That kid that was drunk in New Orleans was from seemingly another lifetime  I can't help him avoid the trap he's about to fall into  I can only work on today "   YES  I relate so much  I'm going to

pretty much what I did  didn't sleep for 90 hours after the sub was finished  but I got the fuck through it   I was just shy of ten years near constant heroin use  Plus crack  cocaine  alcohol etc  Proper self medicater   When you're going through hell  keep going  Fight them on the fucking beaches  I wish you all the best my friend  Get a support network  Feels awesome  Everyone in my GF's family was drinking  I was even given booze as a present  I'm happy to say I didn't drink  And if I had  my GF's family would probably hope to never see me again  NYE seems like the super bowl of sobriety  I play a game called "drink"  The rules are simple    When I open the bottle  I drink it    Whoever drinks wins  "Just for today  I will not drink  I will    	 Nourish myself with reading  meditation and food 	 Slow down during my day and keep things simple   Greet every person with the kindness of a long lost friend" Organisms  Ahaha   Yes  life is about organisms   I will not drink today   It is very great and thanks for the comments stoptrickie  They do think I'm pretty cool    weird      I've been told by my SO that I am "no fun" anymore and I need "to just relax" and "have a little balance" in my life  Blah blah blah  I guess I've heard it all at this point  It's frustrating not having any support but if I put myself in her shoes  she's lost her drinking buddy  her partner in crime  So I get it    Hope you can stay strong in your resolve to not drink  If you can make it through these early hurdles it does get easier   fantastic  boyfriend's in bed with a hangover and I am sitting on the chaise near a window enjoying a cup of coffee in my new Cat Lady mug from a friend     here's to us In  Not drinking today  In  Not drinking today  You are a kick ass aunt   So glad you could get them home safely    No drinks today   Hang in there  Ha  sup fash  Ya  I actually had a really good year  Some sulky shit happened as well  but that's part for the CA course  All in all  2016 brought me an awesome gf  roomatell   and a  cheap place to live  I really can't hate    Glad everyone enjoyed my stories   Love you all you drunks around here  Hey man  if it helps    I'm only about 12 hrs ahead  Oxy here    never experimented with H Fent but I cant say I wouldnt have    I keep trying to repeat to myself that with each passing moment  not only are you that farther from the beast but you're also never going to have to worry about those first days ever again if you choose  I had some significant clean time before this last rodeo that ended up being months long  I'm so sick of the cycle    despite it sucking out of the gate  it's something that we can choose to never do again  feel me  If you can white knuckle without the subs  that sounds like the move    Best of luck  we are in this mess side by side  PM me anytime  Time to tackle the next year of our life  And THAT is what I'd call a Happy New Year   Nice  Well done  I know to a normal person it doesn't seem like a long time but to an addict a day is a long time   I'll be on a month at 7pm   For the next couple of weeks   r cripplingalcoholism is participating in our yearly population survey

a cathedral yesterday evening   was pretty damn good and a great way to avoid alcohol for a handful of hours   Last thing  kids wanted to stay up until midnight  wife and I didn't   but wife wanted a glass of wine   Asked if it would bug me and assured me she wouldn't drink if it bothered me at all   I said I didn't care   and I really didn't   until we were both in bed watching Bob's Burgers and I could smell the Chianti   damn   I actually wanted a taste  but I ignored it and sipped my green tea instead   Wife never has much to drink so it was a 1 2 glass at most and gone in a few minutes   But it was probably the most tempted I've been since I quit   just for the smell and taste   not b c I wanted a buzz or anything   Anyhow  all done with 2016   Not my worst year but in the running   Here's to making 2017 my best year yet  and with a strong sober start like I've never known in my adult life   I can't fail with this kind of momentum and support from SD to keep going   I will not drink today   Add me as well please and thank you  Thanks  and I will join you in saying F' 2016 and not drinking today  Sign me up please  My first sponsor was literally the first guy i met in AA   I kept seeing him at meetings and after a couple of weeks when i realized i needed a sponsor to make this work i asked him   He said of course   It felt weird asking because i made it out in my head to be a bigger deal than it really was   I felt like i was asking somebody to go out on a date or get married or something   That got me all nervous  But really it was no big deal  It was super important for me to get a sponsor  i probably wouldn't be sober today without one to help me through the steps  but asking someone isn't that big a deal   You can always change sponsors if things aren't working out   If you think the sponsor isn't right for you  ask around for other people's opinions   And of course you can start out with a temporary sponsor just to get you moving in the right direction   Ha  indeed I am ready to fly happily through '17  Lots of happy flying  I'm doing very well  thanks  Look at you the STAR of CA and Fash the STARLETTE of Opis  I finished 8th  Im in AWE of you two  This counts for a shot and a shot cheers  But Eighth  PLEASE Im gonna quit my job devote my whole days to these two places we shall see next year  hahaha Im coming for you  u FashionablyFake and you  u Lemarchand Buhahahaha I did basically the same thing  Got drunk early with my brother  just around the house  Played some video games  but meh  it's just New Years  and we're getting too old for this shit  I am totes fine with staying in and not getting arrested   lolz  Good luck and Happy New Year   I'm grateful today  I know EXACTLY what you are talking about   You did the right thing   You put yourself and your sobriety first  which is what we all should be doing   Please don't beat yourself up over it      Once I start drinking I want more and more and more  That's the big one for me  and what made me decide to quit altogether  One drink is no fun for me  so moderation is pointless  I've tried it  it never worked long term  when I drink I want to get drunk   Sucks to hear this about your friends  I have decided that I will have to find new friends to do new things with  I will keep in touch with existing friends  but we rarely did things together that didn't involve getting drunk   good for you for making it through it  I know what you mean  I'm a huge people pleaser so I would have thought the exact same way    that it was on me to make sure everyone else had fun at any cost  you did it  But that should be dopedope dope haha I will also be reading This Naked Mind this year  I hope it gives me some new perspective  I also find myself searching for reasons to drink by the evening time  My goal is to have a plan and stay busy so there is no flexibility  I will not drink with you today  Thanks for being there   Happy  sober New Year  Thanks everyone  And good luck to us all  You have advanced to LEVEL 2 of the Drinking Game   i e  you win  haha    Congratulations guys   Hey there  congratulations on your progress  Your eyes look bright and full of life    And I'm glad someone had a good 2016  It's always nice to hear good news  Ironically it was all the bad stuff that happened in my life this year that drove me to accept responsibility for myself and sober the fuck up  I'm hoping treatment will give me the insight needed to depend on myself to stay clean  Obviously doing it for another person isn't enough  There's too many variables involved  People are flaky and can't give you the necessary support 24 7  Checking in on my 5th day  The first day of 2017  Feeling a bit better this AM  Glad day 4 is in the past    I won't drink with you today   Thanks for the kind words  and I'm glad it made sense  They went so far as to offer us to stay the night  just being good hosts mind you   it was a total green light situation   I won't put myself in that situation again  I trusted myself and also my SO but I've learned that it's best to just not go  I'm very disappointed  I don't judge people for drinking so why am I judged for NOT drinking  It's craziness x I waited a little while  I listened carefully until I heard people share who had the kind of life I wanted  The person needed to be someone with years of recovery and active in the program  Of course  they had to have worked the steps  I think it was less urgent that I get a sponsor because my therapist was a recovering woman  so she answered a lot of my questions about AA  It took courage to ask someone to be my sponsor and not everyone I asked said "yes"  I just asked if they would help me work the steps  That's what I did    Happy New Year to you  too  Kudos for five days  It's a small thing  but I'm really happy that my 2 week badge lined up perfectly with New Years morning  I can't express how much this sub has helped me  You guys are the real mvps   3 I won't drink today no matter what happens good or bad  Thank you for the check in    Thanks slednek    A great start to the New Year  I'm  8 and I gave birth in February  You should see me on a regular year  2017 is already better yay  Greetings sensei  Can I be your sobriety padawan  Thank you  it feels like such a relief to have people relate   Level 2 involves opening the next bottle  Love your work mate  how much do you find the yoga helps with your anxiety  Thanks  Yoga is my anchor  Though I never did it under the influence  I'm looking forward to doing yoga with a clearer head and with alcohol fully out of my system  Cheers  Lemon  Sounds like a good night  You know I can never forgive you for actually living in NYC  but  meh  we all have our faults  you classy  Yankee bast ardent   Boutique to hit the liquor myself  Will match your scotch with a shot of 10 30 am vodka  Mad loves Happy New Year  I will not drink today  Yeah its like     woo     I'm the floatiest turd  Just kidding I fucking love this shitty cesspool I have a head cold  but  that's it  No hangover  no foggy memory  Waking up Christmas Eve  Christmas morning  and now New Year's Day  and all the days in between  without drinking the night before has been awesome  Happy New Year  Taking any sort of anti depressant  anti anxiety medication while being an active alcoholic is the same thing as taking medication for high cholesterol while eating a super sized burger and fries for every meal   Maybe the medication helps ward off worse symptoms for awhile  but it can't make you better   Still  by all means see a psychiatrist   They can be very helpful    RIGHT HERE  AND IT WAS HARD AS FUCK Don't scare me like that     Good for you  bring it on  You are not alone  When there is a family history of alcohol abuse it puts us at risk for alcoholism  I didn't want to accept that I had a problem either  but the evidence was just like yours  When I learned more about alcoholism  it helped me understand it  Reading  Under the Influence  by Ketchum and Milam had a major impact    It never gets better  only worse  You are not crazy   This is great  You can do this  one day at a time     Thanks so much and happy new year to you too  39    I didn't even consider it could've been that long  Thanks and Happy New Year  Chatting is a solid game  I play it every day  myself Okay will do and thanks   Wanted to keep it easy to track  Thanks  My drinking isn't bad enough to require medical intervention  I'm actually 4 days sober right now  Not cold sweats or headaches or anything like that   Thanks so much  I saw your day 4 post and almost didn't post mine because of the similarity  Thanks for the kind words and encouragement   I really do feel pretty good  but the energy is still missing  Taking lots of vitamins in an attempt to flood my body was something good for a change     Here's a video that sums up my feelings about opiates at the moment   https   www youtube com watch v 5FjWe31S 0g Sign me up  Sounds like a plan  Thanks so much  I'll chat your arse off  comrade  With you  I mean  that may sound like a joke  but that is seriously how I live my life  lolz  Good to see you on Not sure I know what a padawan is  but I understand sensei  I am just another drunken idiot who has figured out that my life is better without me intentionally altering my ability to think clearly  which is something I struggle with anyway   I learn from everyone  it is the best gift  Bottle of what exactly  Dear competitor  I'm motivated by all of the stories I've read here so I'm happy to have found a group like this  I will not drink today   happy 2017    Good luck u Direbrian  We're doing it  I will not drink with you today  profj77  I'm the weird aunt     pretty cool  Just glad to be an aunt    Much appreciated  Wishing you luck in return  It's all progress mate  consider it one cone in 6 days  bet that's a big improvement over how much you used to use right   Regarding your withdrawl symptoms I think only one cone shouldn't cause it to come back and I'd try not to focus on worrying about that too much  the anxiety itself can cause physical symptoms    You've got this and I'm proud of the progress you've made so far  We're all in this together to try and better ourselves  Woops  was a typo  but ya  that too For the next couple of weeks   r cripplingalcoholism

lucky to be mature enough to identify it now rather than later  I don't want to have to be driven to sobriety by waking up from a blackout with irreversible consequences  Thank you  I've been watching this subreddit for a while now and I feel motivated by reading all of the stories of success and support from others  Woke up early to go skiing this morning  Wouldn't have done that if I had drank last night  Happy New Years  Thank you so much  We'll do this together  Thank you   Good luck   Thank you  While hitting your bottom must have been heart wrenching you had the resolve to make the most of it   I salute you and your courage over the last year to take control of your life and to be there for both your Family and your own new path   I have had some spare time the last year    No worries  It's an uphill battle  Helluva New Year to ya  731 is kick ass  indeed  Thanks to people like you with a respectable amount of sobriety I feel empowered  Thank you  So I am married to an alcoholic  still drinking  not seeking help  in denial of his alcoholism   We have been married for over 3 and a half years  I only really found out about the nature of his drinking after a year and a half of marriage  We have a house together and have been together for 11 years    To be honest with you  if I knew what I know now back before we got married I wouldn't do it  I would've run  I feel so trapped at times because the idea of getting a divorce is just so huge   lawyers  splitting assets  getting our house ready to sell  selling our house  dividing the profits from the sale  having no where to go after we sold  struggling to buy a house in my state solo  having to tell all my family and friends  changing my name on all my documents  starting the dating life at nearly 30  etc    I cry all the time and worry about the future  I still love him but not sure if it's enough and I don't want to live my life like this forever  I want a family and a good relationship all the times not just at sober times    I'm sick of the lying and hiding of his drinking  finding bottles EVERYWHERE  being on completing different sleeping schedules  the moodiness that comes from his drinking  never abusive just sometimes cranky and rude   and the fact that sometimes I feel as if I hate him  At the moment he's going through a real rough patch at work  brought on by his drinking  and I feel as if I can't put my foot down until it's settled    Anyway sorry for the rambling long mess and to turn this into about me  my first comment on this sub reddit  and just needed to vent rant  but your post stuck with me and I basically felt like I was talking to myself from the past and what I would want to say    I wish you all the best that you can do the right thing for you and your circumstances  Thanks   January 30 is one year  On January 1st  I didn't have the slightest desire to stop but my general health have me a warning sign  This is amazing  great job all of you   I'm sure that this took a lot of effort  keep up the good work     Thank you so much   If I come to visit NYC   maybe in six nine months   will Lem let me sleep on the dirty kitchen floor  You're doing it wrong  We can get cheaper   1  Cheapest tequila you can find  2  T  J 'so margaritas mix   Done   It ain't good  but it gets the job done  You could consider asking someone to be a temporary sposor   That way you would have the support until you found someone who you wanted to be permanent  I'm confused   You seem to be saying that SSRIs are placebos that work "sometimes"   As in not just a placebo effect  they are actually medicinal   Though if that were true  they obviously wouldn't be placebos  Early in the morning  It's 1030  lem  p  Your night sounds far more impressive than mine    Crazy bitch wouldn't shut up  the one I mentioned the other day    Apparently now she's claiming to be in witness protection amongst other things like an "internal affairs investigation"  and I'm not entirely convinced she's not just repeating terms she heard in a episode of Law and Order   it rained  I avoided people  I heard fireworks all night but nothing worth going out for here in the middle of nowhere   Good luck   not today   Okay  I'm in  Your typos this morning are on point   A tiny piece will hardly have any THC in it so I wouldn't worry about that in regards to your homeostasis  and it wasn't intentional consumption so you're sticking strong which is great    Probably a bigger effect on your homeostasis is the second hand weed smoke  but it definitely depends on how hazy the room gets  IE hotboxing a room vs smelling a bit of a joint smoked outside  Which situation are you in  In time you'll find  as will others  that you are more witty and fun sober     Oftentimes someone else's reaction to our new sobriety is a defensive one that has more to do with their internal conflicts and justifications than anything to do with you    It's from Star Wars  A Jedi in training  Organisms are  literally  life  though    Orgasms are just life  metaphorically   Usually vodka but the store here seems to always be out  So rum   It sounds like you belong  Glad you came out of lurkdom  Stay in touch   Aren't new obsessions just fantastic    You love it     You watch fire works    You put it to bed   You don't even rape    But when IT really NEEDS you   you aren't there    So it LEAVES you    Even after you buy  12 Ramen     moved to tears   beautiful  thank you Alcohol increases anxiety  Seeing a doctor might be a good idea  I did     JustCAThings I will not drink today  Good morning  sobernauts   I received an envelope in the mail yesterday which I sat on the arm of my couch   The first thing I did this morning  after putting coffee in the press  was to gratefully open this wonderful card from u ninjilla that contained my   1 year chip     Heading into Year 2 and I will not drink today  I had the same fear   I thought stress and anxiety would destroy me  that getting drunk was all that kept that at bay    Funny thing is that after a couple of weeks  most of the stress and anxiety seemed to disappear   I still have stress and anxiety  but I realize now that the alcohol made it worse  not better   Hang in there  you can do this  I will not drink with you today     foreveralone 1 5 Millilitres  Are we in the chemistry lab measuring drinks with pipettes   Wow  thanks  but I am no Jedi  I don't even HAVE a Light Saber    In Sobriety  we are both just as far from a drink  We have today  Make the most of it  hit a meeting and hang out with some sober friends   If you do  you have improved your chances of going to sleep sober today  Checking in  Good luck everybody     Nice  Way to be able to be there for them    why would you have a lawyer for your first offence with weed   is it seen as a big offence in America  Checking in  Good luck everybody     Envious and proud my friend  How are you feeling  I'm on day 5 right now  It's funny how 2 weeks can fly by when your brain isn't focused on healing but I would kill to be at 13 instead of 5    Keep going   It's wonderful  I went to a close friends house last night to pop fireworks with the kids and hang out  She had her sister and other good friend  all of their spouses and like 2 children for every adult there ha   I expected them to drink  This can get to be a very rowdy crowd   At some point I just mildly asked "yall are not drinking tonight " And she said "no  we decided to make this about the kids tonight"   I was dumbfounded  When I was drinking   I could have neverrrrrrrr done that    I'm happy to be hangover free this morning though      That's why I'm trying this  I can't keep drinking to numb myself to the problems of the world  You're a good egg  that's such a nice thing to do     I would rather see someone do that ANY day than have them reluctantly get in some 'tipsy' driver's car  Im a great believer in luck  and I find the harder I work the more I have of it    Whether you consider the Thomas Jefferson  ascribed  or Peter Thiel version of the quote  it tends to be true    My Day 1 was Jan 1  2016  I white knuckled much of January  but it was through techniques I learned here that I was able to turn my sober January into a one day at a time approach  These include     Daily affirmation  "I will not drink today"  One day at a time    I deserve this for me  be kind to myself  feel some emotion    Messaging the nefarious nature of alcohol to myself  the alcohol marketing doesn't care about me  they just want to sell another bottle    See the little results  celebrate them  Do a touchdown dance     Dry people  dry places    Not wanting another Day 1 or to reset  FTZ  I wish you luck  but I also hope you'll embrace some of the strategies to make your own luck  These are some of the things that worked for me  finding what works for you to trick that evil lizard brain into a docile reptile will help immensely  As a very senior executive I used to work for was fond of saying  "Hope is not a strategy"   Best wishes in 2017  They get angry because they put up with our shit for so long  I can understand him  Maybe having a little talk with him could help  I can relate  Since I stopped drinking  I still stay up way too late on the regular  for no good reason  So I'm still frequently exhausted due to my own bad nonsense choices  but at least I'm not hungover from alcohol  feels a lot better that sleep deprived  and  hungover   Gonna keep trying  till I beat this burden    I will not drink today   pretty good  gota be honest it's festive period so i've had a few drinks here and there  sleep's still really all over the place  appetite come back with a vengence as has sex drive  a chance would be a fine thing    all in all i'm happy  not NA clean but this is what I want need  AFAIK  I'm always re evaluating though    Your EYES though  This is the number 1 change I am seeing in all these wonderful pictures  Your eyes literally look bigger  Less bags  You de aged  Placebos do work  as you've noted it's called the placebo effect    Active placebos are even more effective  as they have side effects that help convince people that they're working    Like how soap makes suds or dandruff shampoo tingles    The suds and tingling effect do absolutely nothing except make people believe they're working    Actual medicine  as you put it  has to have a success rate greater than placebos in a trial    SSRIs simply do not meet this criteria    It's not my opinion  it's just what meta analysis of the trials tells us  thanks  yeah it's a lifetime  may as well be    congrats on a month  Haha  have a good morning buzz going  didn't even realize that was a typo  lolz  But ya  sure  I will stand by it Thank you x  How many times do I have to disgust and alienate people before I realise that I need to sort myself out     Zero    The change starts today  if you want it to  You can do it  Same here  kinda    Myself and my girlfriend had a night of watching Harry Potter and making gourmet cheeseburgers    Was tempted to have a whisky at midnight but fought the urge  because I knew that would turn into me drinking until 6am    Went to sleep about 1am after watching some drunks fight on my road  Had an epic lie in until 12 30pm  Now I've overslept and feel hungover   The reason I'm a raging alcoholic is because I'm anxious  It's my way of self medicating  Perhaps if I was taking something for my anxiety I could cut back on my boozing  I want to see a psychiatrist  but idk what they even ask you  or what to even talk about   Happy New York to you  Lemmy  Looking forward to the continuing saga   If you're questioning something in your behaviour  then you definitely have a problem  You may not have a life wrecking addiction  but it's usually only a matter of time if the problem isn't addressed   I'm glad you're here  You have come to a really good  supportive place  Great job  And Happy New Year  One thing that helped me is for BOTH of us to be blindfolded  It makes it really intimate because you are navigating and responding by touch  and at least for me I worried so much less about what I looked like  Part of this is that it will just be HARD  but the only way things get more comfortable is by practice  It will also get easier as you become more comfortable with your body in general  You might also try to focus on emotional intimacy with your partner   anything that will help you to trust that your partner loves and wants to be with YOU  regardless of what your body looks like  Sorry you are struggling with this    I will not drink today  Not drinking last night was no big deal  thankfully  I was asked why I wasn't drinking  but my response about why was accepted readily  Phew  Welcome Direbrian  I will not drink with you today  Today is an important day for us all  I believe setting intentions can drastically change our lives and out looks    Today I start taking care of myself for the better  Food becomes fuel  Alcohol is out of the question for me   I will not drink with you all today  Alright I'll bring a spare bivvie bag  Look at you being all global oriented with your metric references  How much is 3ml  I thought there was like 40ml in a shot  Checking in Thanks  I will not drink today  no matter what happens  unfortunately  in a lot of states  yes  The 2nd one  one spliff in a room  but as soon as I realised the "danger" I started smoking cigarette after cigarette and holding it under my nose the whole time until they were done and then left   couldn't leave earlier  Also I dodn't sit in the middle but on the end of the couch   Also   for that little piece in my tobacco  I searched through my whole tobacco to check and found nothing  So in the terms of size  if there was even a bit  it was the size of a piece  of dust  It's all good    Orgasms create organisms so it's all connected anyway   Same here  It's a wonderful feeling  "When was the last time you drank and had that warm image  Prob ten years ago  the real image is me not enjoying a drink  but of one of obsession  as soon as it enters past my lips it turns to obsession  in how much and how quick I can drink  I don't feel warm  I feel cold  makes me feel cloudy  moody  unsociable  and then there is the morning after  the disappointment  the headache  the blackout  the shakes  the intense anxiety  the sweating  and most of all the guilt and fear  "  Exactly  I kept trying to chase the amazing  freeing  happy feeling I had early on in my drinking  I know it was an illusion  but it felt great  Honestly  if I had continued to feel like that  I don't think I could have quit  I would probably rather have drank myself to death  But the thing is  it's not that way anymore  It sucks  It's dark  It hasn't been that way for a long time  Years  maybe a decade  It just didn't occur to me that  sobriety  of all things was the answer  I had a compulsion to keep trying drinking  to get it to work again  I will not drink today  Happy New Year  everyone   I was celebrating New Years Day with my girlfriend sober too     That wasn't even a game  just like a practice scrimmage with a junior team  Heck  Arsenal CP even looks like a better matched game  I admire your resolve  How did your friend respond to you pulling her aside  Fantastic  watched LOTR with a few cuppa  stay lit lads  It took me a while and a wife  who can drink normally  to support my decision    Have a great 17  This sub has been a daily stop since the beginning   I also got through part of the holiday season without drinking  as my badge will tell you  I stopped right before Christmas   Here's to a sober 2017  Thats crazy  I was caught here in the UK with a 20 bag and we get a caution for the first offence  if its cannabis and providing it's personal so under like an oz  then if you get caught again your ordered to pay a fine of around 80 then if your caught a 3rd time you go to court and get given some stupid community service  Good luck anyhow bro Welcome aboard  I will not drink with you today   That is a great story  It is amazing how freeing it is to not worry if you can drive or not  I could not begin to tell you how many times the SO was cooking while we were drunk and I would say do not cut your finger or I will have to call an ambulance because I can not drive  Or just simple things like oh we are out of this or that I will just run to the store  Good on you for feeling the power of not drinking  Yeah that's the thing  I've started lying about drinking  I'm seeing someone that barely drinks  which Is great for me  and the other day I thought about hiding my half gone wine bottle  He's never said anything about my drinking   however I obviously am insecure about it  That's not ok   I'm right there with you  As soon as I have the first one  I want another one  and then probably another one  As is often said on this sub  all you have to do is avoid one drink  the first one  Got really drunk last night  So sad right now  I will not drink today  Eh  ring and ceremony aren't really necessary  I got married in front of a judge without buying anything other than the certificate  Wife wears a ring her mother gave her  and I don't even have a wedding band     Who's spreading cheer this new year   Jax is   "But I can't say it because once I admit to it it means that I can never drink again and that is a scary prospect for me " That was how I felt  too  I know it's really hard  especially when everyone around you drinks  You're ahead of the game in recognizing that it's an issue  All I can say is I wish that I'd quit at age 22  I think the best thing about not drinking  for me  has been being able to  live  without constantly thinking about how and when I was going to get to drink again  Even when I wasn't drunk  I was obsessed with drinking at a later time  and it stopped me from really experiencing things  Hey man  could you please tell me what were your reasons for kicking LSD  I'm really interested  because I was considering trying it  but maybe I shouldn't because recently I came to a conclusion that weed causes me some weird derealization depersonalization that really messes with me  so perhaps I should avoid LSD until I'm in a place where I'm more stable and content   Sorry dude  just really interested  please reply either here or pm me if you can  thanks  I'm predicting good things for drunks this upcoming year   I expect this to be the year of "what the fuck" as outrage and disbelief will be useless in trying to comprehend the mindset that will explain the many actions of Prez Carrot and his rapacious companions       Given their antics  every drunk will have the ready excuse   I may be a falling down  useless drunk  but at least I'm not doing       let your imaginations wander        It allows one's drunken lazy ass to be seen as a minor transgression in comparison and provides a quick secondary target that your accuser can direct their disgust and venom against     But if it isn't my kitchen floor  wtf did I have to clean up the broken bong   How much is this TJ  Trader Joe's   mix    I don't buy mixes anymore cause  besides typically drinking my booze straight  they're a waste of money    Simple syrup is made from just disolving a cup of sugar in a cup of water and heating it till it's disolved  only costs what the sugar does    And the mexican mart by me sells 15 limes for  1  or there's always the store brand lime juice for  2  Who's spreading the realism    Jax is  If you don't mind me saying  It kind of seems like you are trying to find the next best thing after you quit something  And that's not a dig at you because I am he same way   When t comes down to it  You got to just go through it without anything for a while  Or you will always be searching for the next best thing   And you will feel kind of crazy like that for a while and it sucks  I'm over 60 days and I'm still moody and get hopeless    but I keep pushing  Because I don't want to be miserable anymore because of substances  I don't want to get fired from anymore jobs  I don't want to be unreliable  I want to be a good person  a good friend  and a hard worker again   sign me up I definitely wouldn't worry about that miniscule bit you smoked then  But if you're worried about any THC consumption being around second hand smoke does expose you to some  no where near as much as actually smoking but a little  Smoking the cigarettes will cover the smell but it will still be in the air    At the end of the day is it enough exposure to worry about  Probably not  but you do seem very vigilant about not having any THC at all  Maybe try and leave the room if people are smoking  Or get them to smoke outside  Try and find a method that will work for you  my anxiety is so much more manageable now  i know it is scary  but i promise it helps so much in every aspect of your life to be sober   Good luck mate       My advice  Just for a bit distance from your pals who are also smokers in the first week or two and don't tell anyone about your decision to quit  i found it easier myself to not share it with anyone until I had a good grasp on it     Best of luck     Craved a drink last night  but made the pledge  woke up sober  7th day today  And I will not drink today  Sex  Yeah that's when I first started thinking 'ehhhh this isn't normal'  when I would dispose of my bottles separately from my normal trash  when nobody could see   Or like  when I would say 'oh no  not drinking tonight'  and then sneak a bottle of wine in   Took me a while to realise that whilst the behaviour was brought on by external factors in my life  it wasn't normal and needed fixing  Lol  oh shit  meant to write ounces    My brain is still recovering from yesterday    I did not drive my own ass home  so I'm still feeling like a winner  even if I can't write properly anymore  omg  hangxiety is the best word ever  thank you for that    happy new year  I fucked that up  edited it now   There 45ml in an US shot I believe     It's day 7 for me and last night was rough as my wife went out  I'm still in that phase where  i think my body expects me to be hungover  so I woke up feeling shitty  By the time I reached the bottom of my stairs  my brain kicked in   "wait  your sober    awesome " It's President Cheeto to you  Mr  Canuck    Christ  I feel like time is slipping away until he nukes us    She wanted to see the ball drop  Eight hours penned into a literal cage   Yeah  no  We drink  Doesn't work that way    Psst  come here  Let's hit the roof  Be pissy  just trust me    I'm awe struck Dev Kit  It's why I came home  Etch A Sketch'd anything I've experienced with "what's her lips "  This will either be the best thing ever or the new end of everything   Did you have a good NY  I ended up staying in    Gotta keep my desperation in check    Time for a rub   tug   For the next

Welcome  Bast ardent   I'll allow it   Hey man  just lurking through this sub and I saw this and I felt the need to comment  I don't know what state you're in  and everyone has different laws  but when I got in trouble I don't think you need a lawyer  You just go in front of the judge  and in m state the first offense was 6 months probation  just don't get in trouble with the law at all   and drug classes  It was all around  700  Best of luck with everything  Like 1030 ain't early for the unemployed drunks   Thanks   No worries  where I would be going there is no bail     I will not drink

will not drink today  sign me up I reset my badge at least twice last year  Always lots of support here on SD  I will not drink with you today  C'mon Jax  Lem turns his shit up to 11 and you'll swoon

day in patient detox and 6 months of residential rehab to kick them  been off them for about 18 months    I checked out that website and unfortunately it seems to mainly mainly a USA thing  there's only a handful of meetings in England  none of which are near me  It sounds good though    Today's been hard  I feel like the mental side is really kicking in now  got up and drank some coffee and my head was filled with about 9 months of kratom fuelled regret    Forced myself to get on my bike and somehow cycled 20 miles  feel better for it now but it was hard work  my heads full of what ifs and could have beens    I feel like I've duped loads of people  all this time I've been using I've been making out like I was clean  I justified it to myself at the time because it wasn't valium  but it's still not right I feel  sign me up I realized I had a drinking problem around aged 24  I was married to my FIRST husband who had a similar mind set as yours  Id gently prod about quitting drinking and he'd start whining that we wouldn't be able to go play pool together and have a good time anymore  In the same breath hed bitch about my daily beer drinking habits and ask me to just quit THAT instead  This went on quite often  Long story short  I'm 34 now and didn't quit drinking until last may  I'm however married to a man that was "only" a best friend now  We split up because I realized he actually wasn't supportive of a damn thing I wanted to do   I wish I would have quit sooner      2017  Now With Less Rape     Haha it's okay  p I was just imagining this drink being mixed in a spoon

bed sober tonight   I will not drink today  I intend to keep it up  creativity been huge for me over the last year or so  don't know where I'd be without it  Thank you  Thank you Ripster  You'll be with us soon enough    Checking in  Not drinking for at least the next 24 hours  so until 8 12 a m  on January 2  2017  That's why your so fucking weary of me  Today was pretty bad  my heads been non

communicating and see what happens  In the meantime  I won't drink with you today  it's a great feeling  congrats  I just went over to my parents    It was fun  I mean for me anyways  but I'm kind of getting old and boring    They took everyone to see Rogue One  which I was kinda getting worried I'd never see in the theatre  bought a few fireworks  which I burned myself lighting  and we had galubkis for dinner    Then it was just drinking and listening to music till I blacked out     Happy New Year Lee  Hey man I know that feeling  Why don't you try and accept that you don't have the motivation to do anything but don't smoke that bowl  Just do something mind numbing like watch TV or whatever you normally do high  Eventually that motivation will come back but it takes time  I will not drink with you today  Reddit  Yes    which is why you use beer and not liquor   p I will not drink with you today  Reddit  Congratulations on your 365   I just hit mine this morning as well  Seems like such a short time  but also seems like a long time as well  In the beginning I didn't think it'd be possible  but as time went on I was surprised how simple it's become  Just seems like another thing I do  or don't do  rather   Way to go  and I hope you continue  one day at a time   I was not scheduled to work today but my ass was still up way too goddamn early  '   Hey    I just creeped your shit congratulations on the 7 days     Thanks for hosting  Happy to not drink with you today  Happy to not drink with the rest of you today too  Peace  i've read similar things about the relationship between gut flora and the brain   you are what you eat  and what you don't excrete   It was hard but I'm so happy I split with my alcoholic ex  Ever thought of doing that   I'm still angry  though   Good for you    I was thinking about it yesterday how bad I had gotten before I quit drinking  How I was not ever really sober but maybe   If my BAC lowered when I was sleeping  Then I'd wake and immediately add fuel back to my blood  I don't think I was really sober that often towards the end at all    Man it feels great to feel great today  I will not drink with you all  As the turns world   I won't drink today  it really is a happy new year  Not yet  I'm not sure anyone wants to take me on    Weary    Send nudes   This helps a ton  I'm constantly questioning my choice to go sober  "It just pot" I keep hearing in my head  It's long weekend days like this when I cave  but I'm going to hold on  Thanks Reddit  I am not scheduled to work either  Congrats to you   My last cig was 10 30 and I haven't had a single puff since  As you know it just keeps getting easier  I can't wait to hit a full year in 2017  I kind of wanted to get pulled over driving home at 3am lol  It's an awesome app and totally helped me pull through  Whenever you feel tempted open the app and remind yourself why you're quitting and give yourself a pat on the back for how far you've come  The first month will be difficult but I PROMISE it gets easier and easier  The cravings only last minutes and then they're gone   Also one other thing that helped me was carbonated water like San Pellegrino     sounds weird I know  But the carbonation gives a bit of a burning sensation when you drink it and for me was somehow satisfying  Hope this helps   I tried it  and it was a poor substitute for me  I found it wasn't satisfying  even on high nicotine  I used it more compulsively than cigarettes  Eventually the thing started malfunctioning and I just went back to smoking    Health effects haven't been studied much yet  but inhaling synthetic oil vapor deep into your lungs can't be good for you  I know a couple people who've had popcorn lung from it  Most people I know who vape still continue to smoke    The only thing that worked for me was joining a support group  I looked up nicotine anonymous which really helped  Something like that could help you too maybe   Dang  Very inspiring  Happy new year  You're all like      " OH   let's not talk to this narc anymore "   But I'm here   and you know I'm here    Don't that just make your skin fucking crawl  Too late to sign up  Would like to be on the list some salt in some step to make it right   Yeah I completely understand  You're doing well  keep it up  Each day that passes I slowly feel better and better  The resetting definitely takes some time  Checking in  Yes  I'm definitely just looking at the short term  You'll find a lot to think about and keep you busy in treatment  You'll also find the support you need    Right now I'm just trying to help you find a few things to keep you occupied and motivated  You just need to make it to treatment  For now  I survived the Eve  and will continue to not drink today Huge congratulations  I hope you're just beaming at waking up fresh to a new year    My own story is a bit different but I really identify with how severe and awful it sounds like it got for you    With you sober today New York sounds cool  but as a European  we often hear about how it is a cesspool of crime and urine smell    So which is it  I thought NY was pretty safe these days  is that true  My manager called me because a coworker called in    I did not answer  They do not pay me enough to walk all the way there and back on my day off with 10 minutes notice   Really hoping this year will be the year I can finally make it and become "clean"   Best of luck to all of you  As a lurker on Reddit for years I finally created an account to post here  I woke up sober and I won't drink today  Starting the New Year off right  I will not drink today  Did it  Congrats to everyone else  Holy Cow  you look great  we can do it    Very very safe these days    It's kind of a police state if you can fall into the warmth of M16's in the port authority   That's not a bad idea  although I gotta watch my salt intake so I don't add salt to hardly anything these days  If you're only having sex with her when she's sober  you're not enabling her  But there might be other concerns besides that  like how she feels about it and how you feel about it   maybe having a sexual relationship would hurt you more if she relapsed again   Sober only sex can be a great reward to someone who's struggling to choose between using and sobriety  But obviously her personal feelings on the matter trump the reward  as do yours   So it's really up to the both of you  Best of luck   3  Haha  working with a new tablet here and some good drugs  CUT ME SOME SLACK  LEMME  GEEZER  LOLZ  Hey  welcome  We are so glad to have you  I don't think I would have made it this far without this sub   I won't drink with you today  Happy new year    I also found New Years to be challenging and mildly depressing  And I spent it completely alone also    If you look down toward the bottom of the sidebar there is a sober IRC Chatroom  a lot of people were on over New Years helping each other out  Feel free to drop in some time     Happy 2017  Nah  I got Dewars for breakfast  First time in LONG time    My skin crawls over a "certain" narc  but not you   I will not drink today   So    here goes nothing  I guess   How about here goes everything  instead  and jump in whole heartedly  You have made the first and most important step already  you made a decision that stopping drinking will improve your life  Not drinking with you today    Hear hear   I'm not sure what my going rate is "to walk "  Way more than anyone would pay   That sounds like a great night  I avoid movie theaters  Too expensive for something I'll either fall asleep during or just completely forget in the end    Let's do this  Yes  you're right   what a great feeling not to have to worry about the simple things  like running up to the store   Thanks Guitarist  That brings back memories    I used to have a really cool custom made glass spoon back when I was doing that    SO was always bitching that I was ruining our metal spoons so I had my glassblower friend make me one  The last line made me giggle a little  Good for you  I'm hoping to gain the same inspiration from sub     I shall fear no longer   My family have been pretty incredible unsupportive about me getting sober  At a certain point you are getting sober for you and not them  just keep sober and let the results speak for themselves   HAPPY SOBER NEW YEAR to all my fellows at SD  I made it   I'm starting this new year with over six months of sobriety and that is the better surplus I've gotten in the last years   I won't drink with you today to give a good start to this 2017  Thank you so much  This is so incredibly helpful for me  I've never dealt with something like this  and I really appreciate the insight  The codependency thing definitely resonates  so I will definitely read that book  Yes  they were wise to call and I was glad to be there   Absolutely better than the 'tipsy' or smashed driver     Thanks CountryStyle    New Year's Eve is a bit different but I've found in general most people don't care  and those that do generally have an underlying reason for it  Again  NYE is a special case  but I tend to say I'm driving or talk about vague health reasons   I will not drink alcohol today      mhmmm   and that's why you won't talk to me    Jax is dangerous      Oh  I miss understood  Carry on  TJ'so is just cheap margarita mix  down south  Definitely not from trader Joes    But ya  I normally roll with straight vodka or maybe some bright and early  sorta kinda of  lolz I love this thread  I also woke up with a smile  not a drop of alcohol last night and I feel fabulous today   So happy there are tears in my eyes   A lot of people fail to realize that a million dollar view often requires distance from what you want to look at       I lived in one hovel with a huge unobstructed view of the complete downtown Van with ocean  stadiums  buildings   Another illegal loft place far enough where the Toronto skyline was framed every evening       My current bolthole piece of crap provides snow covered mountains seen by simply glancing up from my computer       Good christ   there is actually fucking snow still on the ground   a new year's miracle   Snow rarely lasts any length here  and winter is officially over by mid January in this part of the city        Who knows how it will play out  You might not have been an adult when Reagan came to power  but trust me  people were equally as freaked out by his arrival      It wasn't a complete accident that period saw some of the largest anti nuke demonstrations ever   No one was quite sure what he was going to do  perhaps he would get confused and think he was playing a movie when ordering a launch  or it was his role to lead everyone to Jesus        To be fair  just because we survived one doesn't mean we will necessarily survive his 2nd coming  The one thing I've never experienced are the sweats in the am  I will only sweat profusely if I'm taking a sober day and it only happens when I'm sleeping    It sucks  Wet bedsheets aren't fun  Nice to have you  I won't drink with you today   Thanks for the support  I'm feeling the same way  Wait  are you saying I reset it or not  I'm not sure I follow   Edit  I guess you mean resetting our brains take some time x  We separated this fall and he moved in with his parents for several months   It was blissful here with my kids   We were so peaceful and happy   Then he moved back in under the guise of wanting things to work out   He is living in the spare bedroom and still drinking and taking pills   He is meaner than a mad snake and we are all living under enormous stress   It is very very bad here   And according to him  it's all my fault   I can't communicate with him because he is always  ALWAYS wasted   Always   And he lies about it constantly even with the empties  cans and pill bottles  lying around   He lies   He qualifies   He blames   And I am angry  Thank you  I'm not terribly enthusiastic right now  which is probably due to being hungover  hopefully for the last time   But I know things will change as I re learn to live my life without alcohol     Congratulations  You guys rock  Although I didn't make it all the way through 2016  being a part of this challenge was a tremendous source of motivation to me in my journey towards being porn free  It's great to see people on here kicking some serious porn free ass  You all are an inspiration  Looking forward to 2017  Thanks for the suggestion  but I think that "victor" is correct   I did defeat an enemy in 2016  My enemy is not the others on the list  they are my friends and bothers and sisters  not my enemies   and not the challenge itself   My enemy is the part of me that loves porn and drugs and other forms of escape   I don't think this entailed heroism  just tenacity and planning and thought   And let me tell you  if I can do it everyone here can do it  I was an angry BO  daily drunk for over 2 years  I gave up on apologizing or giving a shit for a bit  I still have all of my friends  I call that    magic   How to make a Margarita  https   m youtube com watch v ulnDMwd80SU  Back at have  boss    Yup  there is a good amount of studies out there  During the time that I was using  I always stayed "regular"  Since stopping I only had 1 SERIOUSLY rough morning of BMs  Other than that    just a typical morning shit  I know that's probably TMI  Hey  if it might be able to help someone endure    that's enough for me    I'm really particular about what goes into my body food supplement wise   I guess I put those fucking opiates in there too  I can really attest to the vitamins probiotic help on the physical aspect of withdrawal  The mental game is a little different but like you said    you are what you eat  It definitely can't slow down the healing process by trying to eat supplement in a healthy way   atcha What a great way to start the New Year  Solid post my man  Kudos on your 3 days  LOVE THIS    I was a new years resolutioner back in 2014 and got to 19 months before I decided that the proper  urban mom thing to do was to have that one glass of wine per week after the 1st trimester just to "stick it to the puritanical man " I  too  was back to drinking regularly pretty quickly after my second daughter was born  with "dark beer" being the proper thing to load up on  for the milk  of course   I got back on the wagon 86 days ago and can empirically confirm that the grass is SO much greener on the sober side  The person who commented on your Imgur  what a bunch of asses  over there  btw   and said "not an easy road to walk"  I was like "oh  how wrong you are    " Once you know how awesome sober life is  the struggle goes away  at least it does for me   so I always kind of roll my eyes at the "oh  what a painful  horrible  terrible thing you've had to do" type posts    Git after it in 2017  girl    Checking in   Oh good lord    Sorry  I'm all infatuated and shit   Yeah  but public transit here is shit so that would be my option today  No one was awake to give me a ride at 9   I don't mind doing it occasionally  like yesterday afternoon    But there and back again today  Nope  y'all aren't paying me enough   I was stuck on the HP thing for a few years   now identify with a spirit of the universe   I haven't formulated it perfectly and have a hard time putting it into words but when I speak to my HP I feel I'm speaking to that spirit   I didn't believe in it for a while but did it out of desperation and the truth is that's when I started seeing results     I guess I've come to find out  for me  that taking the actions of the program  even when I don't believe in them  has worked   And I'm completely over trying to explain that to myself because I can make no sense of it  Oh wow  how fancy    I used bottle caps a lot  lol  Disposable and easier to explain than carrying around a spoon   i plan on throwing some light exercise and alot of stretching into my morning routine  That and drinking a good amount of water should be a great way to get my body ready for the day  rather than fapping and dumping caffeine into my body as I would usually do with any amount of free time in the morning  Congratulations on not trying to "squeeze" one in though  Heh just tape it together  I doubt anyone will notice  What an inspirational person  Thank you  I love the quote  Congratulations on your progress  so far   Came of age with Reagan    Saw HW Bush speak at the mall I worked in    Agreed  history may repeat itself   but the populace just gets dumber    Really  Dev Kit    I just wish these kids would get off my lawn     Who am I kidding   I'm deep in no lawn NYC and couch surfing   Cheers from my 2nd Scotch Thank you    I know  it isn't really until hindsight kicks in  and mine is still relatively infant  yet still potent  that you realise how little time was spent sober  Or for at least any great length of time    Maybe it would only be one drink  so I was still in some sense of the word 'sober' but that one drink was enough for my romanticising of alcohol to be ignited  To be awakened and hungry for more    In the morning when I woke up and in the hours up until I next had a drink I never appreciated just   being    I would close my eyes on the tube and try get 15 minutes respite because I felt so groggy instead of reading like I used to    I'd not take note of anything that was around me  Not appreciate where I was and the fact I was alive    I'd ignore phone calls from my mum in my 'hungover' days and bail on plans I'd made with friends  silencing their calls when they came in and not listening to their voicemails asking where I was  I'd eventually reply saying I was ill or too tired from work  But I wasn't too tired or to ill to still drink at home alone that night was I    How is that a life I was proud of  And I was proud   I'd be proud to quote how long it had been since I'd last worked a shift and not had a drink  What a fool   Thank you for your comment and well done on such a long time   Checking in  I'm so hung over from New Year's Eve  I completely agree  movies are too expensive for me   And usually garbage    I hardly ever go  but they were treating and it was Star Wars  so I wasn't about to say no    Left to my own devices I would have just stayed at home drinking  watching my poor sick woman play Final Fantasy XV  So I wouldn't carry you to work and home on my back   But I  might  eat the corn out of your shit    Congratulations brothers  And happy new year  Onward to 2017  Know that you shouldn't blame yourselves for your dad's behavior here  Know that  especially assuming you're young  he should be trying to protect you and listen to your honesty rather than shunning it  But also know that he's human and ashamed of her behavior  and ashamed of his ability to prevent it  If he were more mature he would behave differently  but that's his limit  It's not right or fair  and it's not healthy for you and your sister  If you're mad at him  you don't have to forgive him  but remembering to see what's going on can help you empathize with both him and yourself  Yourself most importantly  you don't deserve this   If you're up to it  maybe you could ask him if the four  or at least three  of you can go to therapy together  Any therapist might help  but one who knows about  CRAFT  https   en wikipedia org wiki Community reinforcement approach and family training  or has a generally more modern view of addiction will be better  Love and luck to all of you  Congratulations   I'm on 7 and am normalizing as well     shattered with resin everywhere     What does 2017 hold   BONG SHOPPING  Great work  guys  Congrats  Haha  I hear you    I made and ate SO MUCH FOOD last night  No regrets though  Never got a hangover from too much to eat    The bruises  I was constantly being asked  "what did you DO " Never had a clue    Meth can sort of vaguely look like salt  Rim the glass with that instead      shittyLPTs What is it they say    the more often you try  the more likely you are to succeed  Something like that  So great job trying again  I'm on my second reset  and while I'd like be perfect  I'd rather be sober  I will not drink with you today  And Happy New Year to you  Checking in  not gonna be about that porn life this year  Checking in on day 1  Happy new year     I made it   Sat 3 feet from a guy toking on a one hitter  too   Didn't even drink all that much  just enough to celebrate the coming of the new year and that was it    My go to lately has been "I'm just happier and healthier without it" which is utterly true and if they continue to press I ask why they're looking for something negative which pushes it back on to them to defend THEIR behavior as opposed to you defending yours  Checking in  Let's go 2017   D Your skin will heal in time  but that kid will always be an asshole  Hahaha      Smile Lemmy   I'm playing    But answer a Pm once in awhile   cunt   Woo  It's what I was looking forward to as I fell asleep last night     Hair of the dog for me  some black tea to fight off the caffeine hangover  I'm three weeks in and feel pretty good  Nice to wake up this way  Was a pretty cool and productive last few days  totally agree  i was like clockwork as well during using days  since stopping subs I had one day of like brown steam  since we're already beyond the TMI point  but otherwise I'm good   don't have money for probiotics at moment though  flat broke    Angry   no  I find being drunk makes me a far more efficient  friendly and entertaining person  Some of the best decisions I ever made were when smashed to oblivion  The solution to your problem is quite clear   'Don't be a Dick'  We have to make mistakes to make progress  But coming on here and justifying your mistake isn't the right mindset to be in  What makes it hard to just do the same thing 11 days from now again   Best of luck to you   stay strong  and realize if you have an addition  there is no middle ground  That's not how it works  There's another sub for that if you want to be a casual smoker  How oddly specific        porn is  just a time suck   Yes it is   And that's a negative consequence of your porn use  because time is our most valuable resource   Addiction is defined as increasing a behavior over time in the face of negative consequences  and not being able to moderate or quit when you want to      Here are some tips for you   https   www reddit com r pornfree comments 2mfxyi concrete tips for staying away from porn    Not really a step by step guide to quitting   if you want that  look into the 12 step programs or other resources listed at the bottom of that page     I believe it  and I'm starting to believe that BSO is a must have  Lol the imgur comments are silly  I realize I take that risk just being a woman and posting so I don't sweat it  Par for the course  It's great to hear you're back st it  My fear is I get comfortable   I feel like I have a "handle" on things and that the proper thing for me to do is to start drinking again   as to show everyone that I'm "normal" like them  My hope is of my lizard brain ever kicks in I'll have the strength to get back on the horse like you've done  Congrats to you and happy New Years to you and your family   r redditorsinrecovery The health effects of vaping haven't been studied long enough but the medical community generally thinks it's about 90  safer than smoking  Obviously inhaling vapor isn't "good" for you but it is undoubtedly better than inhaling carcinogens    Vaping also eliminates addictive  non nicotine  chemicals that are present in cigarettes  like acetaldehyde  Not to mention breaking up some of the mental rituals associated with smoking  for example fondness for a certain brand   Vaping really helped me quit in the early going  Even the first few weeks there's no way I vaped as much as I had smoked and over time I just gradually tapered down to the point where now I only really do it while drinking  If I had to quit it forever tomorrow I easily could  I never bring the vape or gum to work and it's just sort of there as an option if I need it   There's really no reason to avoid NRT if that's going to be the difference between quitting vs not quitting cigarettes   Thanks a bunch and the very same right back at you on 4  Feeling good  right now at least    Bravo for 901 days   u mnhoops                        Thanks for your helpful  inspirational post  It gives hope and guidance to others   I will not drink poison today I was in a casino and there was the smell of weed everywhere  I went home  thought "man  I'd love to smoke right now"  and very easily could have  Didn't cave though   so glad    I've been on fire lately with my side projects  Making some great progress  and to me this new year is just another day on the grind  A lot of people are taking today off  I'm getting right to work  hungover or not   I still get the old image from time to time  usually passes in a minute or so  it's like watching Harry Potter the first film where it's all warm and magical  but in reality it developed into the last few films where it's all dark and twisted   She was fine after that  I was just trying to avoid telling everyone I'm an alcoholic so it was embarrassing for me to have to say I can't handle a sip  She was a little embarrassed but very understanding   Congrats on your year    Sober wishes for your new year as well  We got dis  Living the life    The spoon broke but I still have a glass pill smoosher somewhere  and a little bubbler that he made me     We used to hit up the local headshops and try to sell his stuff so we could buy meth    We made a good team    He had a ton of connections  and I kept him from doing stupid shit    Unfortunately he passed last year    I meant to go to the funeral but got drunk instead    Edit  How do you not burn the fuck out of your fingers with a bottle cap  I have the same sleep appetite issues   Eating very small meals  even if it's just a couple of bites every now and then  helps a lot   Things that are easy on the stomach  broth soups  help a lot   Warm water with lemon first thing in the morning helps   Avoiding coffee helps  this one also helps for sleep    As far as sleeping  for me it helps if I go to sleep as soon as I'm tired  even if it's early   Staying off my phone helps me fall asleep faster  also reading at night     Hope some of these help you     Bravo f  or your sobriety  Hope your new year is sober and happy  Aw    been there     Sorry it's late but sign me up    Like  I know that's philosophically true  but  meh  I just want to be married for some reason  I want the ceremony and shit  I'very had plenty of gf'so  I want the short hand  I want to say this one is my wife   My parents wear 2 brass rings  And they make money now  and I don't know  I just want that  I want a wife    I know it doesn't really mean anything  But Ive always been so broke  I could never actually do it  But if I can  I really want to  Thank you  It was so nice to feel like I got "myself" back  Congrats on your day 1  Keep it going  And I even envy you for your unpleasant side effects   Quitting Kratom after 6 long years was sooo hard for me    Good for you  To a sober 2017 one day at a time  No traffic  no headache  no nausea  grabbed breakfast and watching a movie relaxing  It's a great feeling being sober this morning  Fuck that  tape shopping  Consider it a puzzle to reassemble  Congrats on all the progress and thanks for the encouragement inspiration  It was exactly what I needed right now  Happy 2017  Yessss    so many bad things before my decision to quit  My last event was just a catalyst  Best wishes for your journey  I'm inordinately happy to have made the list  Really shouldn't be this happy about fake internet points but the people in this community make them actually worth something  Yeeeeee let's do it   I will join everyone here in not drinking today  I have a thing for corn  Sue me   I don't get sick that frequently  and when I do  it doesn't hit me very hard  Of course  I've also been picking since I was 5  so maybe my immune system has just compensated  Thank you for your feedback   However I want to clarify that this post was 1  not about justifying myself  it was about not considering every step back a failure  and hopefully stop someone who might have been through the same thing from beating themselves up  because that doesn't help  and 2  not about being a casual smoker  but rather reiterating that quitting does not happen for everyone in one straight line   I quit smoking cigarettes four years ago  but it did not happen in one go   It took a lot of phases and stages to get to where I am now  which has been completely  cigarette  smoke free for four years     Happy new year   I feel ya  they are a grip for sure  What have you been doing so far in recovery now that you're almost at the 2 week mark  Hell ya  Porn is fucked up    enough is enough  right    Keep up the good work  you got this   I posted about  a similar situation  Very close friend last night was pressing me to have a drink  I finally asked to talk to her privately and told her that I have a problem with drinking and I'm trying to stop and that her behavior is making it very hard for me  She understood and stopped and the rest of the night was fine  It's shocking how many people will push others to drink so they won't feel bad about themselves  I'm pretty sure I did it myself   Anyway  good job on staying strong  And congrats on the pregnancy haha   Rebellions are built on hope   Cassian Andor   Seriously though  hope is a powerful tool  Best wishes   Well done  I've not smoked since the 30th of September 2016  60 days was HUGE for me  I was like "whoa I can do this      " Congrats to you keep going  Now that She's gone and I'm focused on Her  I smile a lot more    Now if I could bust a nut    Interesting  It never occurred to me like that   Long gone by now my friend    Hated that bong anyway   Use the force      I'm an atheist and my higher power keeps evolving   It started as and still is GOD  group of drunks    My constant contact with a higher power was just going to meetings  working the steps  talking to other alcoholics etc  Its a little more than that now because I'm trying to get more spiritual and serene   Its almost like the force from Star Wars   Peace  the universe  good vibes  i don't know    it's hard to explain   Meth has been so shitty since ephedrine was banned in the US    The stuff these days we'd call sleeper dope  cause you can actually sleep after doing it    Although I'd like to think those days are behind me    Haven't shot up in years  Ugh I don't know if I could've made it the first 6 8 months without those endorphins  And I hate working out  but love how I feel after  When I start to feel tired or stressed these days I ask myself "are you exercising and eating properly " Chances are if that answer is no  that is the precise remedy to my ails   How long had you quit before the relapse  And how much do you feel it set you back   Congrats on keeping it up  23 days is awesome  Nice  well way to go   There was corn in my salad yesterday   Bro  you got this  Congrats to you  Spurs are certainly in form at the moment  Congratulations  and enjoy Sissoko   heh    I'm bothered with Brighton still pinching our tails  but pretty much certain we'll be back next year  Rafa is a fucking good manager   reassembled a whole squad while making a profit  slashing the wage bill and reigniting the Geordie passion  Yeah in my state at least  My friend got caught with 10gs in a different state and if was just a civil offence  I got caught with 2gs and I have to go to court  I have a friend who spent a few days in jail for an eighth but it was his 2nd or 3rd offense I think   Silly goose  this fucks up my sexuality so badly    Stupid emotions   Watch out  I once used this excuse back in 2013 during a three week stint not drinking and actually WAS pregnant      Good for you for staying sober  Sorry you had to deal with the awkwardness of that  Yeesh  Thank you and happy 2017 to you   Oh you get used to it  I guess  But thanks man  Staying strong   It is a new life  Thank you  It was such a success  I'm so proud of myself  It's a scary thing because I have to remember I'm still broken  but I did it and things went better than I could have hoped  Good way to think about it  I'm a New Year quitter and it does sound daunting  Thanks I personally lurked on this forum and picked up some ideas that I thought would work for me  I put together a rough plan  which I describe in my  "Sunday Solution" post   https   www reddit com r stopdrinking comments 3vn5g7 sunday solutions my plan and path from day 1 to    I found it useful to keep myself occupied  lots of gaming  TV  netflix  and stocked up on sparkling water  just drinking that whenever I got an urge  I set myself goals   30 days  60  90  etc  It took me time to adjust to living and coping sober  and slowly I dug myself out of some of the holes I'd dug myself into      I fail to see how    But okay   I mean that's like my go to porn sub right there  I certainly can't sleep on it but I'm a horrific insomniac as it is  I can't really fuck with stimulants anymore    I swung in the other direction but I haven't shot up in ages either   Get your number badge right  here  https   www reddit com r stopsmoking comments mwwyz now introducing selfserve badges    I am making my decision to NOT drink today  Happy 2017  SD  Once upon a time  maybe    I have a pretty dim view of marriage these days   I'm just happier and healthier without it  This is true for me too  without going into the negative consequences of my drinking  the positive benefits of my not drinking are great reasons in themselves   "wing bar" I love it  Happy new year everyone  You are all amazing  I will not drink with you today  It's true  I stepped on the scale this morning  and in comparison to other food alcohol binges  I was definitely down  Not as much water retention  Woah man u liked your story until what u said at the end Congrats to you on 34 years   You're  my  inspiration  Baffling  isn't it  I hated the consequences of drinking but there was some disconnect where everyday i would start drinking again thinking the results would be different  Insanity  It turns out the only way for me to not have the negative effects of alcohol is for me to not take the first drink  Yeah the effects of nicotine can mildly treat ADHD  Yeh  figured it out x   Thanks a lot and good luck  Fuck it then  Never liked bongs  may as well sniff glue straight from the jar  Very uncivilized    I still am told a lot how I didn't really have a problem  I deal with this a lot too   Because I did not hit "rock bottom" or seek professional help  I must not have had a drinking problem   My conclusion here is only one person should determine whether I have a problem  or the degree of the problem  and that person is me   It seems you've identified a source of negativity in your life and taken steps to remove it   Continue to do what you feel is best for you and your family  What a weird night  Thx SD for the support  I will not drink again today so I can count 100 days tomorrow  For me I had to build a FUN sober life   I did that by making new friends   mostly through AA  connected with a hobby I had always wanted to do but was too drunk and disconnected to try in the past  use physical activity to increase my endorphins and most importantly I had to build up my support network   I went to counseling and meetings   I have to have a fun sober life   but it isn't going to show up at my door   I have to look for it and create it   I wish you luck   I will not drink with you today   Thank you for this  I'm not the OP but I found this comment to be tremendously helpful  I've been struggling with my ED for several years now and also experience many of the same consequences you listed  It's a long and difficult journey to trek through  but your comment helps to remind not only of the painful complications of continuing the ED but also of the beautiful hopes of recovery  I wish you  and everyone else in this thread  the best of luck in beating all of this  I love it when the numbers "add up"       What worked for me is not holding in my anger    It would just build up and then all come out at once when I'm drunk    Let it out in small bits as it happens    Be more of an asshole sober  in order to be less of an uber cunt while drunk  Sign me up please  might as well try  I got bullied about my not drinking by a family member at my first social outing   3 months sober at that point  and I got accused of being pregnant  relentlessly  I got through it  by just saying I'm just not drinking and left it at that  A month later I decided that I would remain sober  and said family member came to accept my choice and accept that I wouldn't be a drinking buddy anymore    My answer varies depending on the circumstance  but most of the time I don't have to justify my not drinking   I just say I'm not drinking and choose a soft drink  When I do offer an explanation  if I don't want to go into it  I'll just say I'm happier and healthier without alcohol  It's real rare that anyone hassles me for a reason  and if they do  I suspect there's something up with their own relationship with alcohol  Today is my first day as well  I'm not only going to stop drinking i think im gonna learn a new language  Congratulations  I'm really happy for you   I'm also in my early 30s and am really looking forward to enjoying my 30s sober     It sounds like you have some hard work ahead of you but have the support and fortitude to make it   I look forward to hearing more from you  I will not drink today  no drinking over Xmas thanx to Sd  Cheers people keep well  How so  "Alcohol as a medicine" is a reference for self medicating  I'm curious why you find that so stupid and idiotic  in your words   Where are these 'twat bags'   I'd like to buy one providing you can keep them in a pocket  Shit  I creeped on your history too    I wouldn't try to quit two things at one time  You have glue  Albert Einstein  'My sense of god is my sense of wonder about the universe '  I always just supplement the word  universe  whenever I hear god or higher power  I'm with you  see you in 4 6 hours   runnersmansud Suggested 30 Day Sobriety Solution to me on Xmas day after I did something stupid  again  and so after many attempts to quit using willpower alone  I took his suggestion and started that very day  It's been pretty great for me  I have NOTHING to do with this book or their proceeds  but it's working  And I might suggest giving it a shot  I did the audio book    Anyway  I won't drink with you today  You got this   That's why you're the narc  Great story to read this morning  thank you for sharing it  Congratulations on everything you accomplished in 2016   and all the best to you in 2017   Thanks  Hey just do the next right thing  If that is crying uncontrollably for an hour that's ok  If the next right thing is getting a glass of water  that's great too  The next right thing doesn't have to be complicated or cosmic  Just love on yourself  and take it easy  This too will pass  Sending my love your way  Family passing is never easy   Thank you so much  That's incredible  Good luck to you on both fronts  Others have suggested The Naked Mind as well  I haven't downloaded that just yet  but 30 Day Sobriety Solution seems to be doing the trick for now  It's hard to explain what makes it different  but it is different  Somehow  Anyway  enough  I'm rambling  Glad you're here   Hey hey   now     We don't use that word    I prefer " emotional infatuatior " Thank you  Fuck that  I have standards  Absolutely  Thank you  I'm only 5 days sober  but I made it through last night without a drink  Congrats everyone        No more socialising with people who can't respect my boundaries  Like your SO    You gotta explain to him why you don't drink  Why you can't  And explain again  Some people don't understand addiction but it'll be important that he does for him to be supportive  Fair enough      I'm aiming to be a victor of 2017  D Wow  What an inspiring post  I will not drink with you today   I kinda figured you had a little when your roomie was holding    You did have some awfully long posts for a couple days    Not judging  I would have done it    I have horrible insomnia too    Probably why I like alcohol so much    Blacking out is just about the only way I can keep normal hours    I'm feeling depressed and angry a lot of the time  and alcohol is just making me volatile  You are now on the path to being clear headed and mindful   Alcohol only exacerbated my anger and depression issues as well   Buckle in  as the first few months can often be a roller coaster of emotions  at least it was for me     It is well worth the ride      every single regret I have centres on alcohol  Sounds like you've identified a source of negativity in your life   Your decision to be honest with your wife will likely strengthen your relationship and open up the communication channels  which is usually a good thing   I was never honest and open with my wife about alcohol problems and now I'm divorced   Probably not coincidental  As Annie Grace's father said  "It's not doing me any favors " Nope  don't need it today  Happy 2017   I have the world's slowest metabolism  thanks  gastroparesis  so no big deal if you miss a flight     Wow  I am super impressed that you talked to your friend like that  That's really brave  and probably exactly what needed to be done to stop the badgering  Some people just don't understand the seriousness of our decision  Well  with a name like Chimichangas  Keto might be a struggle for you   May I recommend  these   http   www poormansatkins com blog low carb chimichanga recipe      Wow the transformation is incredible  I hope to be you one year from now  Day 9 v2  welcome new sober people  You will soon discover how great it feels to wake up in your own bed without a hangover  it's awesome  I will not drink with you today  That is magic  can I have your friends  Zip lock freezer bags    Keeps a prostitutes junk VERY FRESH until you're ready to blow another load    Pro tip   Wrap her head in aluminum foil  The lips get all puffy once the head is removed and you put it into a zip lock    Just trust me    You dont need to heat powder   That's not how it works when you're blacked out  I am not in control  I can't just do that  No worries at all   I appreciate any comments   I definitely have not forgotten why I wanted to quit in the first place   I went into it without a real plan other than to take it one minute  hour and day at a time  and for me going 11 days was a real win   I wasn't prepared for last night because I did not expect this girl to have any weed haha   I wrestled with whether to consider today a new day one or not before I posted this and realized that it really didn't even matter    Going from smoking from the time I woke up till the time I went to bed  to sharing a spontaneous j with a friend is progress for me     I can't predict the future any better than anyone else here  but what I can do is control the way I react to things like setbacks and perceived failures    I'm three weeks in a feel pretty good  Wallet isn't drained  brain much clearer  and motivation high  But I've slipped plenty myself  One has to dust themselves off and get back in the game  Check Good message man  You know what's up  and best of luck with the college semester approaching   Hope I can make it  It's my first football weekend without a drink  I'm a nervous wreck  Hopefully my team does well and I don't think about the drink  Please keep me in your thoughts  Thank You That's what you did  How bad were you when you were bad  How do you let out your anger  I'm not an angry person at all  I don't know how to let out my anger  I feel like I don't have any  but I feel like that's because I let it all out when I'm drunk  Day 3  Feeling a lot better finally  I will not drink with you today    This is all incredibly helpful  Thank you so much for sharing your experience and advice  I'm with you in that the luck I believe in is the fortunateness to have found a supportive group that shares a similar belief system and encouragement that I have   Thank you for your help  That's so awesome  What great news on New Year's Day  Congratulations  Sober on   If     You aren't THAT new   Thank you for the encouraging words  I'm going the same road and sometimes it feels like I leave people behind  but then there's people like you who do the same and   kinda validate my reality  So  thank you  Your resolve's an inspiration in my life    And to the OP  stay strong  use effective boundaries and become better day by day   This Naked Mind was a true "game changer" for me   Also read Stop Drinking Now which was also very good  Said every alcoholic ever  yet we really don't  Do we  My mouth is  watering    Two weeks  I haven't been this hungover in years  I woke up and immediately wanted relief and thoughr about kratom  I won't do it  but I thought seriously about it the first time   I am going to hibernate today  This subreddit is for those concerned about others drinking  which it sounds like you may fit  However it sounds like you want to stop drinking yourself so head over to the stopdrinking subreddit  Sorry I don't know how to link   It's why I now refer to Brenda as my former "Emotional Support Pig"   In  Nah man  I get it  I've just never been one for stuff like big weddings and such  It's only a fluke that I got married to begin with as I never had a desire for a family  kids  and all that    If she's the one though  you can always get married on the cheap side  Then have a bigger ceremony later on  You can have a pretty badass wedding for relatively little money  and if you got two people putting money towards it  it's easier  Of the few weddings I went to  the best was the smallest one  Handful of people in a park with a rented pavilion    Fuck  now I've got the feels  The couple that got married were a shitshow  and the marriage didn't last  but the chick I went with was seriously the most awesome girl  I basically cast her aside  because i knew she'd need a better man than I could be at the time   Perfect timing   Just finished watching Red Dragon   Fuck it   off to buy some spirits now  Beer simply isn't cutting it  Don't let that ego disease thought keep you out   There are always people who are willing to sponsor or willing to guide you towards one   The disease of addiction is based on total self centeredness  which comes in  those  thoughts   "no one wants to be my sponsor"  It wants us to fee separate  different and alone    Which is why the value of meetings comes from identification  hope  and sharing   Just go ask someone who seems like they have good recovery and are involved in the program  Don't listen  watch  You'll see it more than you'll hear it   Keep at it  the love in the rooms is there for you  What did you learn  There has to be some value in that  If your hubby does not drink  you may want to remove the alcohol from your home  It would probably help during times of impulsive temptations  User name checks out   All I'm trying to say here is  it's ok to have set backs   It's ok to slip up   And it's ok to be ok with all of that   So many times I've gone a couple of days  smoked  then figured to hell with it all  I already failed  I might as well give up   My point here is to rid myself of that line of thinking    You're still learning Niki  you can cut yourself some slack here   In trying and relapsing throughout last year  I found that there were moments of panic craving that would come out of nowhere   Sometimes I'd head to the store for a bottle  I noticed that by the time I got in my car and drove the 5 10 min to the store  the feeling had mostly past   So that's how I learned that those feelings will pass   in usually no more than 20 minutes for me   I came to see having them as the dues I needed to pay to get the proverbial monkey off my back   it was almost satisfying to  pay the price    I know I could not have alcohol in my house   it would just make it  too easy  to pick up again  If I were you then I would get rid of the other 20 suboxone   When I say get rid  I mean  destroy them   If you don't need them anymore then you don't need them   For me personally  when I held onto things like that it was because I was telling myself that I couldn't dispose of them just in case I "needed them "  As in  just in case I relapsed because I still had it in my mind that was a potential option   Anyway  you are doing a good job   I am proud of you for making it this far   Keep going   You will only feel better and better  Yeah  this is really what happened to me    Our couples counselor the other day asked me what got me to drink again  I went down this path of "oh  we were really worried about this or that and work was really stressful   " and then I cut myself off and was like  "Wait  No  That's a lie  It wasn't that at all  It's just that I thought I could handle it again  I was sure I had it beat " And  you know  with the extrinsic motivation of being pregnant  I was fine  it's once the baby was born that there were more work arounds that I was able to get a steady buzz every night  My second time around rock bottom wasn't want most people would consider bad  it's just that  in comparison to how great sobriety was  I knew I was selling myself short  Booze and mamas is a topic I could go on and on about     This is lovely  Thank you for sharing  Me too  Actually I just really wasn't sleeping  lol  It was insanely frustrating me because I could not manage to drink myself into oblivion and she was annoying the fuck out of me  much like the bitch who took her place is doing right fucking now     Like holy fuck  people NEVER SHUT UP and I'm not exactly subtle that I am not in the mood to talk about their stupid bullshit on my fucking day off  That's why I'm in bed attempting to avoid people  ffs    That's not to say I'm completely innocent    But last week  nah   Thank you   This really helped me  was very tempted to smoke during NYE party but then I just remembered your post  about the fact that it's never just one  so I resisted     Happy New Year   Tuna   You've been missed man  Fucking outstanding to play wth you here again    Happy New Year brother   I am not the person you just replied to but please do post   It is always easy for me to find reasons not to when I know that I really should   if not to help myself  to possibly help someone else  And the real junkie in the house rolls up   3  Checking in  trying to string together a good streak  that's good to hear  I know I am repeating myself here  but if you're serious about getting better and need medical help  don't worry about the money  There are people out there whose job it is to help you get the help you need and how to get it paid for  and getting that help now is a lot better than dealing with a catastrophic health problem  AA is a good place to start  and a good tool for staying sober  but sometimes you need some good old fashioned western medicine  Love this story  I can't think of a more perfect NYE  sober   present   and quite possibly saving lives   Well done  Happy 2017  Yes   let's make it the best  I will not drink with you today   My best friend drunkenly said "but you're so much fun when you drink " and my  now ex  boyfriend implied that he liked me more when I was drinking    so I made it a point to prove my best friend wrong and I dumped the scrub of a boyfruend  So now I'm way more fun than ever before without the anger of alcohol and the dead weight of a scrub             Yea that mental side is hard and it's most likely gonna be like that for about 4 5 days  but just hang in there  you are doing great by bicycling 20 miles You have taken the most important step which is to put that shit down and decide to be sober  The good thing is that your daily dose wasn't very high like many other people I've met that take up to 30 grams a day  it shouldn't be too long for you to feel level headed  Keep exercising  I found these non habit forming herbs and teas to be helpful  valerian root  helps with anxiety and sleep   yerba mate tea  great for depression   and coffee helped me get through the blues  If you can't find yerba mate  tea  green tea is another fantastic option  it has loads of L theanine and caffeine that help with the mental side  I drank loads of yerba mate  and green tea to get through the withdrawals  maybe around 4   5 cups a day and valerian root and melatonin at night to help with sleep   I know how you feel about feeling like you had been fooling everyone because you were using kratom  You know  the way I see it  kratom is a very powerful and useful tool for coming off other drugs and for me it was a godsend in the beginning because benzos left me with an insane amount of anxiety when I stopped using   I felt as if I was broken somehow   Was I a fraud for using kratom  I don't think so  I needed to readapt to my surroundings after fighting Benzo addiction and I feel like taking kratom was a good step in the right direction  It is hard  to readapt to life post benzos  My addiction lasted well over 10 years of Xanax and Valium abuse  and to me it was a necessity to fight Benzo cravings which are fuckin mental   Now that I'm clear headed  I feel like a stronger human being  and I just begin everyday setting the intentions of staying sober and healthy  I avoid people that use  that was the hardest part and that's where recovery groups help sooooooo much     Just stay strong  you are already a strong being for leaving those insidious benzos in your past and in my experience  kratom's withdrawals aren't as bad as those of benzos  but everyone is different   Push yourself to be social while withdrawing because it helps you not think of "the what ifs" and you will see how occupying your mind eases those thoughts out of your head  Also  I can't emphasize how much meditation helps in this process  it will make you feel in control of your mind and body once again   Best wishes mate   Where in England are you  I love England  I'm obsessed with all things British  I'm in Austin  Texas and this place sucks  Checking in  Good luck  everyone   Same  I was really tempted to smoke last night as just "one last cig" before the new year  but I had already made it so far and didn't want to throw away the work i had already put in  Just got a jump start and feel great  Happy new year   There is no mention of that being in the original post   someone gets drunk a couple of times and thinks" wow  this is my medication and what does everything think about that"  I took that as an idiotic question from a stupid individual  satisfied  I meant when  Obviously    Just like you know if I tried to come there my ass would end up on a STL bus station floor again   Hot showers feel great while still going through the motions of detoxing   I showered as many times a day as I could while I detoxed   I preferred to bathe but there were no bath tubs at the rehab that I was a patient at nor would I have wanted to get a bath in a tub that is probably oozing with the end result of 30 men just getting clean and their hormones back if you catch my drift   Keep going man   You're doing great  I saw a quitting post a while back from someone and there was a comment about getting a group going to try and keep tabs on our progress  I never saw any good options of how to stay in touch  Last night was my last round as well and going to need the same moral support some of you will  Any ideas  Good luck everyone  happy 2017  You did well  OP  It does sound like you handled it the right way  When the time comes  you can apologize to her again about hurting her feelings  Makes sure that when you do  though  it's for her feelings  not for you telling her what upset yours  You're entitled to your feelings  and you didn't do anything irrational here  I promise  As someone else said  there's a difference between aggressive and assertive  Being assertive is actually a really valuable skill  and it's important for your mental health   Yup I drank a coffee at like 7 pm and stayed up until close to two  Sure beats an alcohol hang over    Sign me up please  Looking to an improved 2017 Schooling people everywhere  Well this is enlightening   Excellent news       Hold my beer  What could possible go wrong  Not today Sounds like lots of good insight to your past and a great plan for your future  I've been noticing that quite a few of you with big numbers next to your stars on SD are members of AA  It works if you work it   and it sounds like you're working it      yeah  I was handed some sort of Mexican "energy drink"    it's like a green tea soda drink    effing delicious but I was up until 4am feeling great hahahah so now I'm like too much sleep in the wrong part of the day hungover      ugh   I'll take it  25 year old buddies   I made it through last night  Onward to a sober 2017  I will not drink today  Sneezing and not sleeping were always the worst two things I experienced when detoxing   Eventually  after using long enough  constant vomiting dry heaving was thrown into that mix to create a trifecta of "I hate my life" symptoms   In the first 1 1 5 weeks of my recovery I didn't sleep more than 1 5 hours which happened one night while sitting up in a chair   Beyond that  I didn't sleep for so long that my eyes went cross eyed and my vision blurred to the extent that I couldn't tell who a person was without them telling me even though they were 3 feet in front of me   I didn't die though and neither will you   It is miserable but the reward is tremendous   Good luck man   Happy near year  good luck As someone who just bought their last dub  I feel you  I honestly have been trying to quit because I spend all the money from my  8 05 job on weed  and I realized being high all the time is too expensive for the amount of work I put in to get my money  And music is honestly my absolute favorite thing to listen to while high since everything feels so incredible  That gets a big WTF     About a two weeks into my sobriety  my wife  a 99 8  non drinker  says to me  "I'd like for you to be able to moderate someday"  She gets it now  and kept me on the wagon xmas day when I almost cracked open a bottle of pricey red wine that had been gifted to me by someone who didn't know I had 350  sober days   Stay strong  I've not yet wished I'd drank the day before  Stay strong and remember why we are not drinking  You can do it    I was uncomfortable being around people drinking at one point  but it got a LOT easier for me  I hope today can be full of love and hope for you  First check in of 2017  I will not drink today   Congratulations  Hooray  In 3 hours you can do a lot of other things  If it was 30 minutes okay  I got up the courage to ask a guy after about a month   Mainly because I saw the winners  the guys with the sparkle in their eye  all had sponsors   Sounds about right     Oh shit  I don't know how to condense my entire angry drunk life into a single post but I was arrested twice for beating up cops if that's any measure  it was bullshit but still     Sending xboxes for a swim a couple times  threw out all the SO's clothes twice now    Not many people will willingly deal with me anymore        The thing is  when someone pisses you off  do something about it and be done with it there    You're not angry cause your socialized to take shit and deal with it    But us drunks have it all come out at once    The gf pisses you off  tell her off    The wife burns dinner  make your anger known    Someone cuts in front of you  beat them mercilessly     Address even minor annoyances  Lets's talk  man  The best part about you messing up new years eve  was that it was last year    Chin up  fam  We're not even 24hours into the new one   You got this      P s  i quit drinking 2 years ago after binging a 26 of gin  at least  a day  If i can quit drinking  I can quit smoking recreationally   And if i can quit  i have faith that you all can  too   Keep it up  AA has helped me get this far  Similar problem for me  I'm going to vegas in June for a long planned 40th birthday for my wife  For a week  She doesn't drink so it may be doable Three hours in to the new year and you already have some non drinking victories    happy 2017 and happy sober Sunday  What activity are you planning to replace with using alcohol marijuana  Coming from one disgusting human being to another I'm lucky enough not to have any heavy drinking friends   Glad you're  we're  not puking today  For the next couple of weeks   r cripplingalcoholism is participating in our yearly population survey   Please take a few moments to answer

Christmas and am closing in on 9 months clean  Beyond grateful   One love x Hey you had the balls to admit it  You can move from this slip up easy  Well I think that's a really rude thing to write but it's your opinion and I can see where your coming from in a cynical way  I hope you have a great 2017 dude  take er easy   Nice work u stoday  I like the quote  got me thinking  Happy NY and best wishes for a great 2017  Please  Take them  Thank you and best wishes to you too  I think you can find several threads about this   I quit twice  once cold turkey  once using an ecig   Cold turkey was pretty brutal  but after a week or so I was ok   Using the ecig was much easier  but it drew things out and I still had cravings the whole time I was using it  Same here     You got this  Errr  thanks but I haven't been on Reddit for a while  I just got my badge reset  this is day 1  Haha   Congrats on your 481 days though  Was Christmas alright for you this year  2nd sober Christmas I assume   The plan  I'm telling everyone I'm just doing dry January  not that I think I've got a problem  My brother's doing it as well  I'm thinking about going to some AA meetings but not sure  I've been a few times before and I'm not sure it's for me  Other than that I'm going to get back into running  I used to run marathons but my fitness has gotten really bad since I've been drinking pretty much every night for the past couple of years   Other than that I don't know   any tips  Sometimes it's good to have an obsession  keeps us alive and moving  I like to have lots of obsessions    Booze will forever be my first love though       Fireworks    I'm not going to drink today  Almost 4 years   Congrats  I actually sat here NYE and stared at your post for a loooong time      what I showed you was actually only the tip of the iceberg    not to discount everyone else's great advice and comments   I thought about another addict I brought back into my life  who has never abused me in this manner  and is now a successful and happy person and a good friend      and it was really hard  but  you're right  A friend WOULD NEVER say something like this  and even more importantly  I WOULD NEVER SAY SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO ANYONE   I told them that I was genuinely happy for them  he has a   um    sugar daddy   who buys him things  I told them I was really happy that he was better and wished him joy  happiness and success in the coming year   I also told him that this would be where our paths diverge unfortunately  I felt really sad   Anyway  thank you and everyone for the advice  Happy New Years  You need to heat up the water so the powder dissolves in it  Nice   I still remember somebody posting on here that people don't care what's in your cup  they care about what's in theirs   I found this to be mostly true   Only time I see people pushing me to drink these days is when they themselves need to justify their own behaviour  I wanted to give the "what makes it hard to do the same thing 11 days from now" question some thought before I answered   My immediate reaction was to think "well that won't happen"  but I can't say that with any more certainty than someone saying "this is Day 1 and I'm never ever smoking again  although I'm sure it happens  I doubt the majority have it happen that way      So I put myself in the hypothetical scenario  11 days from now I'm with a friend and they offer to smoke   Say I cave and wind up smoking   So now I've smoked twice in 22 days   Should I get upset about it   Or should I just keep on keeping on and think ok  smoking twice in 22 days is far better than my smoking 5 times a day habit  and now I know the situations and people to avoid for a while longer   Getting upset about it would likely lead to me smoking more  while the latter line of thinking gives myself permission to be kind to myself and move on     I find it helpful  when sober  to write down the reasons I don't want to go back to drinking  especially immediately after slipping when the bad feelings are fresh  Good for you for being back  We will not drink together today  I mean     I don't know shit about junkie ing but even with my limited knowledge I know people ain't melting down powder ffs    Seems like a waste of some drugs along some lines  Oh hi  I remember your username from when I first posted and you were magnificent  Thank you and the same to you     I've had a major problem the last couple years  My last drink was at 11 57pm last night  Just poured out anything leftover  I will not drink today or this year  Yeah  you want 16 24 hours     it's not about the amount of time  it's about how sick she is  I mean  you want her to be in FULL withdrawals  It sucks  but it's the only way to make sure you don't make her REALLY sick  and trust me  precipitated withdrawals are awful  I know I'm a few days late to this  and not to offend anyone  but the only thing I can suggest is that she'll need probably 4mg tops  Bupe  sub  works way better when used in smaller doses because of how your opiate receptors receive it  the whole partial agonist thing  so there's most likely no reason she should need 16mg  That's a crazy high dose and you want to get her off as quickly as possible  When you give it to her  give her 2mg every 45 minutes until she's well  That's how a detox would do it  Good luck  It's so nice of you to be there for her when you know that she's obviously using and that's kinda dangerous  Take care of yourself and her  Let us know if you need anything  and keep us posted   Day 1 and waiting on badge reset  I will not drink today   I am starting today also  Best of luck  Let's make 2017 a year to remember  quite literally      So  I'm not talking from successful personal experience here  so take it as it is   I also worry about what you describe  and I think a lot of people have  The one thing that I hope is that I am able to change my thinking about cigarettes so that they hold no value for me   A year in  or six months in or even two weeks in  there is no addiction in any physical sense   The only reason we even consider going back is in our head  so it must be that we romanticize smoking  in some misguided self brainwashing   Its important to continually work against any idea that smoking is at all good pleasurable etc   I compare what I should be thinking about cigarettes to what I do think about heroin  maybe it feels good sometimes  but it is a sure ticket to poor health and death and there is NO way I would shoot up even a little  Not ever   I mean like I can guarantee I would not shoot up heroin in my lifetime   So  ya  think the same about cigs   Sign me up  Ready to do this   Uggghhhh me too  I drank diet coke  and iced tea all day  I never indulge in that much caffeine  then stayed up all night with my nose in a book I can't put down  Hubby and I promised each other to take a walk in the woods before sun up  so we could see  the first light of the new year together  5 am was too early but we'll worth it  Now I'm sluggish and tired  but happy and proud and ready for some new beginnings   Happy New Year  Man    don't lie to the doctors  This makes me laugh  but not for the reason you might think  I went to those fuckers as honest as possible  Like  doc I'm drinking myself to death type shit  Do you know how much they tried to convince me that I'm exaggerating my drinking and that a 25 year old female couldn't possibly believe she's killing herself with the sweet nectar  So much so that they refused to write down the reason for my liver issues  I said that I'm an alcoholic  but they were kind and wrote "anxious but pleasant" on the dismissal papers or whatever the fuck they are called  Made it through New Years Ever  and I feel rad   Here comes another 24 hours     Yeah  I believe it   It was an incredible bitch for me after only 3 yrs   I think once the habit has been ingrained though    hard is hard   And no matter how many years a person has been using  it is completely worth it to drop the habit     Last night was nerve wracking for me  it was hard for my wife too because I think she was nervous for me  we wound up having a really nice time with friends and at the end of the night instead of being drunk I was able to gather our kids  drive home  put our kids to bed    help our son when we has having some stomach issues  All things I never would have been available for in the past and would be catching tons of grief for this morning because my poor wife would've been left alone to tend to  Also  woke up this morning and let me wife and kids sleep in  when she got up there was a pot of coffee made and I was able to make the kids breakfast  we were able to have a nice conversation rather than deal with me zoned out on the sofa waiting for a hangover to pass    life is much better this way  I feel like I've evolved from needing alcohol  Sign me up  Let's go   Awwwww   now we having a heart to heart  I mean  ya  I've had a bunch of fucked up relationships   But man  this feels like the one  We been together 6 months  I stay drunk  most all the time  But she's OK with that    I know I'm a drunk idiot  but I think about marrying this girl every morning I wake up  She has had some bad experiences with being married  But I haven't   Every single morning I wake up next to her  I feel like the luckiest guy in the world   I think I want a big out door ceremony   I want my step dad to read the vows that I write  and then everybody gets drunk after    Let's just all have a good time and then I'm married   Wow  I'm in awe and in tears  Thank you for telling your story with so much humility and grace  Your 'What Happened' and 'What It's Like Now' give me  so much hope   God bless you  Congratulations  Hitting numeric targets is awesome  Keep up the good work  Dope is water soluble and does not need heat  The cut is what ends up dissolving when you heat it  You dont even  need  to heat tar except that it breaks it down faster    Oh  wait  Are you not in the states  I'm not sure about  3 which is the H they get in Europe  I will not drink today  I don't use AA anymore  I did though  You know  doctor  You know   Well I already detoxed from dope  Alcohol is my Problem now Loving this quote  What novel  Thank you  I stared at this and another posters message NYE    My friends don't say shit like that  neither should yours      and although he constantly accuses me of being 'negative' and hurtful  I had actually started to question myself  and re read almost everything I ever sent him over my phone and facebook    Long story short  it came down to this  I PERSONALLY WOULD NEVER SAY SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO ANYONE   much less a friend  and you only saw a very small portion of the pages of abuse    And after wishing him joy and happiness  made it known that this would be where our paths diverge       thanks everyone for all your advice      and good luck to you in your own battles and lives  As I said in my other post  I have a good friend who battled her way back from the brink  and she has never been abusive in this manner to me  and she is happy and successful and she fought every step of the way back up  So I guess I'm saying this because I don't want to leave you guys and   girls     um   ladies     with a negative image   This is just someone who was a shitty person before and he's a shitty person after  Addicted Sober made no difference  AA has been and continues to be instrumental to my sobriety   Glad you are giving it a try     I will not drink with you today  I still do   I have made a lot of friends in AA and they are part of my support network   I get something out of each meeting I go to    It feels great to greet the New Year with a clear head and no hangover  Happy New Year fellow sobernauts  I will not drink with all of you today  That left one looks great   Thanks  I'm three weeks in and feel pretty good  Nice not to be hung over  empty wallet  anxious  etc  I know it is up to me  but there is so much I want to achieve this year  and wasting time in a binge withdrawal cycle will not make it possible  Best wishes for 2017 to you  Okay  I am going to check it out  www pira    er  netflix  netflix  Man I hated living in STL    Have you been excercising  Cycling has helped me tremendously  maybe go out for a long walk or a bike ride  I was a 10  year daily smoker and I'm only on day 6  but daily excercise and plenty of water has really helped to get my appetite back  Insomnia has been more of a problem for me  but if I bust my ass for an hour or two on the bike I sleep like a baby  Easy for me to say though  I have been into cycling for a few years  but I probably couldn't have quit weed without cycling  Its okay to feel completely defeated for a few hours  but don't let some random idiot kid run your life  I'm sorry this happened to you  but I think its important to remember that this is a kid  They are impulsive and probably don't know any better  I  and I'm sure a lot of people on this sub  have gotten picked on  and it sucks  but a lot of the time its done by people who truly do not matter in your life  are not part of your life and we could probably care less if they vanished and we never saw them again  I know its hard to accept but the people in your life  and my life  all of our lives  who are worth spending time with and who care about us truly do not give a single fuck what your face looks like  Incidents like these make you more resilient and are motivating to help stop picking  But really  I maintain that the worst thing someone with CSP can do is be down on themselves for something that is so hard to control  It makes you feel completely out of control  we're not  and makes you feel like shit and when you feel bad  you pick more  I know it was probably so humiliating and I'm not trying to say "just get over it"  but I know you are capable of using this experience to make yourself stronger instead of letting it bring you down  Its the only way shit is going to get better  I didn't live there  I got kicked off the bus from KC     Happy New Year SD  Celebrating my first voluntarily sober NY  It was a great night  I will not drink with you all today  Here's to a sober 2017  If you are even relatively productive for the remaining 13 hours of being awake then I see no issue with that   Me too  Let's do this  2017 is going to be a great year       Oh eff  that's awful  I'm so sorry that happened to you  I'm 39 days in off a 3 5yr addiction today as well  Still battling some depression for sure  I've pondered whether or not I should get back on antidepressants but have decided not to  I've taken them in the past and can't say that they did much for me  I wanna figure out how to live a happy life without any of that shit  I don't trust it or the doctors that prescribe it    Have you tried exercising  I realize its about the last thing in the world that any of us wanna do after quitting but it's better for your mind than any pill any doctor could ever give you  If you can push thru the first week  you will start to look forward to it and even enjoy it  Also    eating a very clean diet does wonders for your mind and energy levels    Good luck on your journey and hang in there  Happy new year   On my last attempt to quit I would watch small bits of this video while outside instead of smoking  I would download it because YouTube takes it down for copyright infringement  I have a copy on my phone   Good luck   It feels awesome  doesn't it   Bravo for seven months    Hi  If you check the sidebar of  r stopdrinking  there is a link for "books"  You will find quite a selection there         It's like you've never done this before       You dont even need to heat tar except that it breaks it down faster    First off  the only opiates I banged were pharmaceutical    So I don't know shit about tar    But when you want to slam your meth  coke  hydromorphone  whatever  I  guess  you can drop that in water and wait for it to dissolve in its own sweet time  not knowing if you're wasting any of your precious drugs that weren't dissolved yet  or you can stick a lighter under that bitch and make sure it's good to go right fucking now  I only got one happy new years text too  Every year i always send at least 6 or 7 out  It actually was a realization that I don't really have many true  supportive people in my life  Another reason to change  Also was an indication that many people aren't awake drunk at midnight   Is NYC alcoholic friendly  It's so weird  Logically I know that weed doesn't even make me feel better at this point  that it's a shitty drug for me and that it actually makes me feel worse than I would if I were sober  but the habit of smoking is so built in and automatic that I just go on ahead and smoke anyway even though I know what will happen  This is classic addictive behavior   I haven't ever seen anyone heat meth either     It is a good feeling to know that  first  I'm now trusted to follow through with what I say I'm going to do   and second  I am sober and  mostly  clear headed at any time  so I can offer safe options to those I love     Congrats on this first milestone    I've never been bad enough to be taken to a hospital  I think it's because my friends know better than to freak if I'm dying  I have my own DNR pact going with my girls  I always say I wanna go happy  Aka  drunk  I'm with you guys  I hope this is a great year of change for all of us    Not drinking today  Exactly the same thing happened to me  Does this mean we failed already  I mean  technically it was New Years Eve night  correct  Love this  Sets a nice tone for the new year   sign me up  Made it through last night  even though I had a fight with my so after being at a new year's party for five hours  If I can make it through that I have no excuse not to make it through today  That's really shitty thing for her to do   It's great  however that you can just let it roll off your back   And  I agree  it absolutely says more about her problems with alcohol than you solving yours   Have a great  sober new year  A little late but please sign me up     It was difficult but I was able to find the strength once again  It's hard to forgive yourself for the all the damage and deal with what seems like a futile recovery  I wish you luck on your recovery as well  thank you for the kind words  I am here to talk for anyone who sees this    You can piss in the street  pass out on 41st street and have a homeless crackhead blow you     I'd say so   Yeah  definitely cynical I'm being serious though sick of these kind of questions  real drag on the forums  anyhow Happy New Year to you and yours   cheers  Yeah  definitely cynical I'm being serious though sick of these kind of questions  real drag on the forums  anyhow Happy New Year to you and yours   cheers  Got home after partying for New Year's Eve and PMO'd while drunk and high  Since that was last night  does that still count as a relapse  It was past midnight  so technically it was the first of January  Just trying to be honest here  I know  haha  I was at a friends house making music until like 2 am  and when I got out to drive home there was a huge snowstorm  I was able to drive home safely  something that would have been impossible if I was drinking  I also thought about how getting pulled over would have been funny  I was always paranoid about that before and now I don't care anymore   I've made it through Christmas  and now New Year's and I'm really happy about it  2017 is going to be a great year  Are all opies not pharmaceutical     Heroin is a pharma    My lord  You too  buddy ya  I been dealing with a lot of shit  Miss everyone around here  too  Mad loves  bro  When I think about all the time I wasted  Relapse is part of the recovery process  Dust yourself off and try again  Thank you for being so understanding and providing this support  It seems that no one in "real life" understands so this was so nice to hear  thank you for making me feel less alone  Yup  definitely a relapse  Quit as soon as you can and stay away from all things gaming for at least a month  Don't worry  It's very normal  Keep on keeping on  You're such a good aunt  thank you for doing that for them   It's like you've never done this before    17 years IVing heroin on a pretty much daily basis except for recently  I think I've done this before    I have much more experience with H and less with pills  But i also know that you still dont really need to heat pills unless they are the gel ones that need to be dropped in hot water  Pills  especially  should not be heated because of all the binders  It's basic harm reduction   This is what I came here to hear  I know logically that the best thing would be to quit forever but I know that I just can't handle that  Staying the fuck away from opiates and getting my life back  Only on day 5 right now  vacation is over on Tuesday and I'm fighting a monster head chest cold    I'm so thankful for my wonderful wife and family  Despite not feeling many positive emotions at the moment  I know that underlying gratitude is the purest thing I have to offer  It's tough to just say it without having the true emotion behind it  One day at a time    Edit  My plans for this year    I have a job promotion on the horizon  Wife and I have 7 months left on our lease before buying a home and plan on trying to conceive our first child in the fall  Damn  I'm so fortunate that I didn't fuck that stuff up during the last year of addiction  Great post  Best wishes for 2017  I'm looking forward to all I can do if I keep myself on the right track  Thank you  And Happy New Year to you too    I am super proud of how easy it was to say NO  I was at a party with my friends smoking around me  Never once was I tempted  I didn't drink excessively either  I know I am going to beat this now more than ever  My mind is finally getting right  Thank you everyone  for believing in me and being on my side  It was such a wonderful thing to find leaves  You guys are without a doubt the reason I made it this far  Whenever I felt like failing  reading your posts hardened my resolve to succeed  Happy New Year  Please post this to  r stopdrinking   r alcoholism  or  r alcoholicsanonymous    As a recovering alcoholic  I can say you have good reason to be questioning your relationship with alcohol  When there is a family history of alcohol abuse  it puts us at risk for alcoholism  That applies to you  One of the symptoms of alcoholism is an inability to control how much we drink once we start    I needed lots of help to stay sober  I got a therapist and went to AA  I had no alcohol in my home  didn't go to bars  and stayed away from anyone who abused alcohol  That's how I protected myself    If you continue drinking  your life is going to deteriorate  Alcoholism gets worse  never better  It is  however  not a moral issue so try not to be ashamed  We are good people with a bad disease    I hope you find the help you need and deserve   Well thanks for the honesty and you too brother   Support from my family has been hit or miss  which is a strange dynamic to live in  They're either praising me or teasing me   and they feel the need to tell EVERYONE that I'm sober    Happy sober new year to you  too  Yikes  What a terrible thing to say  You're definitely not a loser     congrats on almost 100 days    This is so  so awesome and puts into words what I think a lot of us  hopefully  feel  What an accomplishment    I'm only 30 some odd days into it  but I have a starting day and day 30 pic that I'm pretty proud of  I'm a little too protective of my anonymity to post it  but I'm proud of it nevertheless  Your post is especially great because one of the exercises that's helped me is visualization and I've visualized posting updated pictures at 3  6  9  and 12 months  how I'll look and feel when I post them  etc  To see your absolutely terrific metamorphosis into a truly ebullient being  no other word to use  gives me a great frame of reference for how I want my own 365 picture to look  Thank you and congratulations     So  so true  Thank you for these words of wisdom   Congratulations  Starting into 2015 and into January 2016  I lost 30 pounds  I kept up with my fitness routine through all of 2016 and got stronger and gained muscle  Toward the end of the year  though  I started putting on a lot more body fat  There's no question that alcohol was preventing results  and in fact  making me fatter  Today is day 12 of not drinking  and for most of December  I've stopped caring about what I eat drink  I'm feeling the extra weight and anxious to get it off this year  But  I'm putting not drinking as the first priority and dealing with the extra weight for now  Hopefully my 2017 looks like your 2016  I'd use it  Post updates if you begin progress   It sounds to me like he's making up an issue with you to avoid looking at his own issues   It's so much easier to blame someone else than to accept responsibility for his own problems   The thing is  being around recovering people sooner  or later    usually sooner    we see through this and call people on their crap   He'll get called out for being a victim   He won't like it   He'll likely accuse the person or people who pointed this out to him of being unfair  and try to cast himself as the innocent   It won't work   What's more important is that he'll be made aware of it   There are two paths out of this  change and grow  or stay the same and go back to the destructive life we lead before   He may do either   Hopefully he'll change and grow    Someone  will work with him if that's his choice   If he stays the same   any  person needs to cut people like this out of their lives   No one benefits from having someone like this close to them   A person who chooses to deny their own role  at least from my experience  is someone to be pitied  and prayed for   By the way  I was one of these victim people  blaming everyone and everything else for my own screwed up life   I went through being called out   I changed and outgrew it   There  is  hope   Have a great 2017  with one less piece of ballast clinging to you   Peace and love     Hahaha  Thank you  That's awesome  Being direct and honest definitely would have been a better approach  Learning as I go here  It does  Yeah things get worse before they get better in my experience  Just give it time and get an Albuterol inhaler prescription from your doc   This is the way it's supposed to be right   Good stuff right here Well done  YOU  Congratulations on making it through a really hard time of the year  I did as well  and I am proud  I tell you   I'm brand new at sobriety  as you can tell by my badge  and have nearly no wisdom to share whatsoever  But I want to share something that I have to remind myself  constantly  which helps  I keep wanting to say 'I'm never gonna drink again'  and I really want to say this morning 'Here's to a sober 2017 ' However  I'm trying to remember to only say 'Here's to a sober today ' because I can do that  I don't know if I can not drink for a whole year  and I have major doubts that I can not drink for the rest of my life  But I  know  that I can not drink just for today  Just one day is easy  So I'm gonna focus on that  and I will not drink with you today  Yay    Congratulations  Those alcohol calories really do add up  I've "only" lost about 16 pounds since getting sober  but that's two pant sizes down     Happy New Year  I will not drink today  Happy New Year  Happy New Year  sign me up dude  We are starting development next week  I would love to have you as a beta tester   Happy New Year  Happy New Year  sign me up foobar  Happy New Year  Awwww yeah    The clean garage switcheroo  Have a happy and sober New year  Happy New Year  Happy New Year  Checking in  Good luck to all  Happy New Year  I've had something similar happen  grown ass adult woman asked me "what happened to your face " while I was at work  and was miserable for days    People suck  Children are worse  Don't let this stop you from living your life  It's all good man  My wife was the same way  had been married twice  and both were assholes  She knew I drank  as she was my liquor store cashier lol  and was cool with a little drug use  It was rocky for a while  but we've been together almost eight years  and married for five    Seriously though  that sounds like a decent enough situation  and an awesome wedding idea   I actually managed to stay up until 1 am last night  probably more surprising that being sober for it haha Happy New Year  Checking in  Yes  dealing with similar deal here   Wife drinks a lot and I know she does not like my sobriety   I have tried and failed in the past   She likely believes that any day now  I will start drinking   Would be nice to have a bit of support and encouragement from her but that is not the case   Funny  as I would have it for any other self improvement endeavor     She is a lovely person but not ready to quit herself    Best of luck to you    I was where you are three years ago today     Happy New Year  I love it   Although one way of wasting time in advance does come to mind  drinking   Without that  it's totally true  Me too  except the withdrawals  thank God  I went 315 50     Someday I'll  we'll  say "when I finally got sober in 2016   " A truly shitty year  at least I  we  got sober  Alas  unfortunately there was one gauntlet too many  and I gave in  Nothing dramatic happened  but definitely not worth going back down to zero  nor worth feeling hung over today  I've requested a badge reset and I press on  hope you had a good NYE  I'm looking forward to continuing in a more positive direction  even if I took a quick step backward   I quit for over a year  Had a rough few weeks and thought cigs were gonna be the fix  The first one did nothing for me and was a huge disappointment  So I smoked a second  Still nothing and then I felt like shit smoking again  A year down the drain    A few days later I finished the pack and suddenly cigs were doing their magic  Because I was addicted again    Took 7 more years to quit again for more than a week  I'm now at 200 something days    Don't start again totally not worth it   Wow  if you're not full of shit you wasted so much    You heat it up in a spoon for a reason  Happy New Year  I will not drink today   Beer taper has simply to be delayed  There's no other way of saying it  No biggie  planning on drinking a bit the next 14 days anyhow  One won't hurt  Is it 100  necessary for me  Probably not  Could I have a drink once in a while or smoke weed once in a while and not get addicted  Absolutely  I can go to a dinner and have one glass of wine with no problem and no urge that I need more  usually I don't even finish that one glass  I've never been very fond of alcohol or weed  so I can use them once in a great while without a problem  Most alcohol I can't even drink because I have celiac disease so the majority of alcohol will make me very sick  for example  I can't drink beer or any malted beverage or hard cider  white wine  and many of the dark liquors  so I can basically only drink vodka and some types of red wine   But I can't use opiates because those are the drugs I was always addicted to  Some people get addicted to every drug substance so they have to be 100  clean  I'm not one of those people  but it is very common  I hear all the time about people who got clean from heroin opiates  alcohol  coke  benzos  and then thought they could have one drink or smoke one joint and end up either getting addicted to the new substance  yes  I've seen plenty of people get addicted to smoking weed every day  or they get intoxicated off the substance and their inhibitions drop and they think they can use their drug of choice just one more time without repercussions  It really depends on if the person gets addicted to everything they try or was only addicted to one substance  Most drug addicts I know and used with would use multiple substances  usually heroin and coke  heroin and benzos  heroin and weed hash  or heroin and alcohol  and I was never like that  Really    I don't know how you'd get half a gram of pure ice to disolve in a spoonful's amount of water in any kind of reasonable time without heating it  Nope  never does    C'mon in  the water is fine   Well yes  Originally  they were all pharms   But there's a difference between a pill from a pharmacy vs street dope in terms of the purity  cut fillers  etc  and you potentially have to break them down a bit differently depending what it is    For example  you can generally trust that what you get from the pharmacy is unadulterated and not cut with fentanyl or random crap  but it's often also not usually in a form that you can just immediately shove in your veins because of the fillers to make it into a pill and the anti abuse mechanisms they put on a lot of them   You found a good place  my friend  Today is my day 17  and if I didn't have this group to vent to  and to get encouragement from  I wouldn't be at the strong place I am today  No one here will sugar coat things  We are all in the same boat as you  But everyone here is on your side  I have nothing but respect for you for beginning this journey to find your freedom  Stay strong  Check in here all the time  If you feel down  read the posts of others  I found that by helping others here  I actually helped myself  Happy New Year  Sign me up please Cograts on your 8157 days  Not too shabby   I've been diagnosed with various things as well and have been on various different medications but I think all of the psychiatric problems are probably related to my addictions  When I was younger I smoked weed all day for years  I've gotten addicted to extreme weight loss in the past and now I'm addicted to alcohol  It's pretty clear that I've got an addictive personality  and hopefully if I deal with that  the other stuff will sort itself out  It didn't to me  It started off really dark and got very wise and happy in the last five sentences  How much strength you must have to have broken that cycle  And isn't it lovely to know your son kids will never know what they missed   Have you tried the nicotine mouth spray  I use that now and never crave cigarettes   except when I drink  I'm still addicted to nicotine but the main thing is that I'm not breathing in smoke  Nicotine isn't actually that bad for you  One of the few good things to come out of 2016 was my decision to get sober  So welcome 2017  I'll take you one day at a time  and I will not take drink today Good luck  the thing that sucks about family is you can't choose them like you can choose friends  happy new year's and sorry that happened to you    This Naked Mind has been the most powerful thing I've come across to help me make sobriety permanent   https   www reddit com r AskReddit comments 5lfl9l what did the most drunk person say or do last    Happy new year fam   Awesome post  I had the strength to say  "Fuck No " I thought I would allow myself a drink of alcohol if I really hit on cravings hard but I don't like the effects of alcohol so use it as a very last resort and know from previous times that   like you  booze is no substitute for weed      it only weakens my resolve to not smoke   Sooo  no weed and no booze  Woke up happy and clean    Congrats on closing in on 100 days    i'm kinda glad i dont drink anymore too  i was second guessing myself by crawling into bed at 10 30  but after reading a few of those stories  i think i am done with stupid shit like that   Not going to drink today   Checking in  Happy to be sober   Listen to some music  It always helped me  Hang in there man  This will pass  What you feel isn't "normal"   Thank you  Are you offering a bath  or a swim  Both would be agreeable    Nothing like a good back scrub  We never had a problem with it  so idk    I shot more opis than meth though   Awesome  I'm glad you had a great time   Happy New Year   At the end of this month  I am set to become the account manager for a 70 year old company   The opportunity wouldn't exist without my recovery   In 2015  I lost the love of my life as a direct consequence of my drug addiction and criminal behavior   I deserved to lose her  and in retrospect I'm grateful that she left me   It provided me with a more tangible bottom   She is now part of my life again  which is wonderful   Again  not without recovery    I was  300lbs  6'1"  at the end of the line on painkillers and dope   As if being a dope addict isn't depressing enough   I was also obese   I'm currently strong  230lbs   Eat a plant based diet  lift weights  and practice yoga regularly     My goal this year is to become more intensive regarding my step work   No excuses   I feel as if it's vital for me if I wish to continue personal improvement   This community is very supportive   I appreciate you guys immensely     "That no addict seeking recovery need ever die   "  One day at a time     I have your same problem  Right now I'm working on cutting it altogether just because I can't risk those times it does get out of control  It's a slippery slope   Outlast it  Your testicles won't fall off from it or anything  Your body just needs to get used to new ways of living  But we are adaptable as a species  so don't worry  You Rock  Unless you eat too much  yeah listen to that dr advice and keep drinking thats worse  but fuck you need salt in most cooking  Of course  I started face picking when I was in 5th grade and finally have it almost entirely under control  I'm 22 now  I still slip up from time to time of course but have learned to quickly get back on my feet  so I can relate so hard to so many of these stories people post on this sub  and it truly helps and motivates me to be able to share any advice that I have  I think that its impossible for anyone who hasn't suffered from CSP to truly understand the humiliation  the self hate  the isolation that people with CSP go through  And so a lot of times people in real life don't really know how to help  Thats why communities like this are so important  I think it really takes one to know one    In my experience it takes many months to begin to achieve clarity  What you're experiencing may be what's commonly referred to as the "pink cloud " There is nothing wrong with feeling artificially awesome but be aware that it may  and usually does  end  It's important to keep working on the self  even when it doesn't seem necessary  Doing otherwise is like scoring the first touchdown in a football game then taking your team off the field  Or so I'd imagine  I've never seen a coach make that mistake     Keep on keepin on  For me the best way I "helped" my husband was insist his drinking problem not be a secret between us  I said if he really wanted to quit and change we needed to tell our family and close friends  That sounds harsh in a way but I felt like this  it would be harder for him to just act like there was no issue if he had told other people  Plus once he broke the seal so to speak it became easier over time to tell other people  Now he proudly has his 2 year chip on his keychain  I feel like by it just being something the two of is discussed dealt with it was too easy for him to decide it wasn't a problem anymore  It also to me showed he was serious about getting sober which I needed otherwise I was seriously considering separation to protect myself and our child  I had a little more than 30 days since the relapse before that  It was my second 30 day stretch in the last 3 months  The relapse brought back an increase in anxiety  depression  and cravings  Mentally it felt almost like starting over  The emotional side of this is so much harder than the physical  The thing I learned from this relapse is that the addiction finds something in your life or yourself and exploits it to draw you back to using  The thing you start obsessing about feels so real that your instinct says the only way to make it feel better is to use  I'm keeping that realization in my head and identifying the negativity as my addiction trying to get fed   Welcome to one derland       I have some weight and fitness goals    2017 is gonna be the year I finally get strong enough to do pull ups   A fellow sober Wisconsinite   I feel like we're as elusive as Bigfoot   Also back to day 1    I will not drink with you  I will not drink with you today  Reddit  Thank you   I will not drink today  I can easily not add salt to my food    Not drinking     well  that's a taller order  Happy 2017   Sober start for the new year and not drinking today  Peace   Awesome  Thanks for the support  You do not heat pills   And Hardly full of shit  She knows what shes doing  Congratulations for your success so far  Stay strong and don't get too complacent  We believe in you  Oh your comment is so sweet  thanks If you want to  I'll help you get sober   and fit  Currently drinking for the next fortnight  but need to be absolutely dry later in the month  Shout if you need a buddy  Thanks I will not drink today   My first hangover free New Year's Day in many  many years   Feels great and I'm keeping it that way   So jealous that y'all have horses to ride  Horses are amazing therapy     Archery  Cooking new and neat things  Being content with nothing to do instead of feeling bored  I totally agree  I always say I don't crave it but at exactly 6pm after work and shower it's there  Therefore I DO crave it but just didn't admit it to myself    Great post  Thank you  Congratulations to you both   I'm a few steps behind you guys  and was equally excited to wake up feeling good this morning  especially since I couldn't fall asleep until 5 am     Looking forward to a sober 2017  I will not drink with you today  It's better on this side   Of course   I will not drink today  Happy New Year  all  Woke up with a clear head this morning and so glad I didn't drink last night  I would be feeling ten times worse right now  Staying strong  Tha's awesome   Congrats      My simple syrup in this post is a good example    Sugar is soluble in water right   Take a teaspoon of sugar and dump it in a teaspoon of water    Got a bunch of sugar still sitting in that water     Heat it  and the problem is solved    That's why you heat stuff    I don't know if that other guy is bullshitting everyone  or really managed to go 17 years doing it wrong  but that's why you heat your shit before you pull it into the syringe and bang it    Otherwise you're wasting drugs  Sugar sweaters  I had never heard that before  but it's the best description of that feeling that I've ever heard  Almost made me run to the sink for a good tooth brushing   Me too  drank so much ginger ale I have a stomach ache  Ginger ale hangover                      real hangover    Happy new year  That is awesome  Way to go  being helpful and providing for your family  Great start to the 2017  I won't drink with you today   It's horrible at first  before I could never get past 3 4 days and 7  days for me was a long streak but I would always fail because of worries about blue balls  This is tempory though  My big problem was that I would get sexual thoughts and fantasies in the coming days which made it extremely difficult to carry on  On a long streak when it's been many weeks  I find it much easier to block these thoughts  they are still a threat if I let my guard down but for me it's now easy enough to block the thoughts and think of other things instead  I never thought I could do this  I thought I was hooked for life but it's possible to break this bad habit  No more guilt checking to see if anyone's about before getting on the pc and checking out the filth  Those days are now gone  Hope this helps and good luck  Sign me up What is your nicotine level in the juice  Happy New Year   I'm not drinking today  It does seem that way sometimes   Well  it takes a lot of willpower to commit to never looking at porn again  so I would make sure to ask myself if that is a reasonable first goal to strive for     Fighting a serious addiction is going to require some big changes on the inside   You need to literally change the way you view the world   Right now there is a psychological need that porn fulfills for you  and your job right now is to find out what that is   Therapy can be helpful for this   Once you find out what that is  you can set out to find a way to fulfill it with healthier alternatives     You're already going in the right direction  just try to make sure you are doing this for the right reasons   I worry a bit that your wife may not be understanding enough of the gravity of the situation  and as a result may not be as forgiving for future slip ups   So remember that you are also doing this for yourself   You aren't just doing this just for your wife or kids  you are doing this because you know that when you've conquered this darkness  that you will be able to shine a little brighter   Good luck   Yes indeed    Thanks ninjilla  hopefully I'll be requesting a 1 year chip next December   I'm sorry to hear you don't have the support of your husband and that he is abusing alcohol  I was in a similar situation  That's why I got all the support I could find  starting with a therapist  Frankly  I couldn't stay sober with a partner who chose alcohol over me so  with a broken heart  I ended the marriage  I went to Alanon meetings  a support group for friends and family of alcoholics  see  r Alanon  as well as AA  It saved my life   It's awesome to never feel that sack of sh1t feeling after a relapse anymore bro  I went from 18 to 12mg the beginning of Nov   Haha been awhile since I saw that  Fuck Thurs nights ruled How do you remember this but not our conversations  heh WooHoo   Day 6 for me too    Congrats to all of us in our first week   I am still taking tentative baby steps   I struggled a bit last night     actually experienced some pretty strong cravings  but I didn't cave   And I didn't cover up the craving by drinking booze   I sat with the craving and even though my thinking had me wavering a bit  I held strong   I did it    Ya  me  My motivation and energy is starting to come back   I smoked heavy for 30  years so I know a week clean is a drop in the bucket and to not let my guard down   I cut back considerably before I quit to minimize the withdrawals and that worked for me   I never lost my appetite but even so  I can only eat soups with very little meat now whereas my normal diet is steak and salads and bacon and eggs    I am sleeping good and waiting for the dreams to start   I had a short one last night but I want more   Are you dreaming like crazy   I love the intensity of withdrawal dreams   They are so real  Yes  I am feeling much better   My head is clearer    I can breathe easier     I am not paranoid    On to Week 2  We got this  Try taking probiotics  I've had a very limited appetite for over a year but I got sick for about a month and the antibiotics I took to get better totally wiped out my gut flora and made me feel like shit for another few weeks  Started taking probiotics and now I have an appetite I haven't had in a looooong time  Obviously you're not coming off of strong antibiotics but from what I've read now combined with my anecdotal experience I believe that most stomach issues are caused by an imbalance in your stomach bacteria  It's possible that you have stomach issues and the weed was just covering that up   Just a thought  hope you get better man  I sincerely wish you well   We are in the same boat   I'm 38  started when I was 18    Old habits die hard   My monkey brain is running in circles    "what was it I was thinking about   oh yeah  have a smoke   Wait  shit  you quit   No smokes   Do something else   I know   have a smoke   Damn it   just forget about it   go smoke or something   fuck   I know " AHHH CONGRATS  I was a biochemistry major  I don't need a lesson on this  But my shit always dissolved fine  There is a solubility limit but as long as you don't put an extreme amount it should dissolve perfectly fine without heat    We reheated crack to cook off the soda etc but that's about it   Im experiencing extreme fatigue after using 10g of bali twice a day for a month and now im confused depressed  no motivation  lack of enjoyment with normal activities  I've had the same feeling  enjoying simple little experiences and sensations that I normally wouldn't notice   Sometimes I actually feel a little high like you said  like I got dosed with a little ecstasy or something   It may fade eventually  but I like to think it's our bodies thanking us for treating it better   Also maybe my mind feeling so relieved that I'm not a slave to alcohol anymore  letting it dictate my schedule  activities  mood  energy level  etc   Let's enjoy it while it lasts       Happy New Year   I will not drink with you today  You got enough blood   Wait stupid question  There's nothing dangerous in those binders    Claiming that's harm reduction is silly    Solubility isn't instantaneous    Like I posted to unicorn  take a teaspoon of sugar and dump it in a teaspoon of water    Notice all that undissolved sugar even though sugar is soluble in water    Now heat it    Problem solved    People clearly do not know what they're doing    I just don't know if people don't know better or are flat out lying about doing it at all  6 Days and going strong  even managed to go to the pub yesterday to watch football and just drank orange juice  that was tough  Was good to see friends didn't mind which was good support       man    I'm going to do it too just because someone down voted me  Thank you  I stayed home alone  but I stayed sober  It was a very depressing New Year  but at least I didn't smoke Nice    A little  yeah  I mean  I wanted to decrease my level earlier  but I guess I kind of let myself fall into a zone of feeling content where I was and a little bit of a fear of withdrawal   Glad to hear it    And to you  I owe you so much  I've been awake for about 3 hours and I've had about 30 unconscious urges to smoke already    It's a messed up battle   I can't believe I did this to myself   Hang in there Congratulations to you   I wish I had been with you last year     I hope you can help some of us out  You are the man   I didn't have to scour my phone for dumb stuff I posted or texted    Oh man I can so relate to that  6 days sober here and I've been on about a 6 8 week bender  I'm still afraid to dig more than a few days back lol    I didn't have to scour my phone for dumb stuff I posted or texted    Oh man I can so relate to that  6 days sober here and I've been on about a 6 8 week bender  I'm still afraid to dig more than a few days back lol   I will not drink today  Sign me up  This is a new beginning  Inspiring stuff  Thank you for sharing  I didn't stop smoking until I went to sleep  it was probably 3AM   Now I am happy to be done smoking   This is the hardest part  though   There is a monster inside me that I'm killing and it's trying to fight back    Agreed  I hit a personal rock bottom but it wasn't visible to others  It's funny how people feel entitled to ask so many questions about why I don't drink and then comment on how they disagree with my decision  It doesn't bug me as much anymore but sometimes it's frustrating to do all this work to be sober and to feel like society sees me as a bit of an alcohol hypochondriac  I am just glad I have my personal internal motivations to keep me going strong so I don't get caught up in other people's view of myself  You're 16  pick up a hobby and lose yourself in it  Some suggestions   reading  gaming  watching movies  running  or just go hang out with some friends from school  Don't know any  Go meet people  You're 16 man now is the time to fuck around  develop skills in whatever you have an interest in and waste your entire day doing stupid shit with your buddies    Im sure you will get some sick Fuck excited   Go for it  I'm so sorry to hear about your father in law   Give his son and him a hug from us all    Checking in  still going on strong  I'm sorry that she said that to you  but I agree with you that it's more about her projecting about her issues rather than being about you   One of my best friends stopped by last night wasted  and for some reason thought I had previously agreed to have a drink at midnight   After harassing me about that for a while  he tried to negotiate for me to start drinking again just 1 or 2 days a week   Then to "quit"  quit not drinking  after one more month   He wouldn't let it go until we managed to distract him and change the subject   It is a challenge we'll likely continue to deal with occasionally  so I agree with your approach on not taking it seriously   Sounds like you had a very enjoyable New Year's celebration   Congrats on your almost 100 days  Happy New Year  I will not drink with you today  Yes  Please sign me up  Thank you for opening this for another couple days  Closest most of these fucks will ever get to a vagina  Happy  happy 2017   Survived NYE and greeting 2017 clean and sober  Feels great  I will not drink with you today  I like it  no luck needed   But I wish you luck in 2017 anyway  it can't hurt right       I will not drink with you today  Very impressive  Congrats you guys  glad you made it all the way through   Right back at you   I'll take messages from anyone who has quit and is facing the demon  Quite true  I'm slowly integrating though  It's a hard journey  I'll keep an eye out  Thanks for the input  I think when a person is early in their recovery from smoking weed  their number of clean days is very important to them   I know it is for me   I am on Day 6 too  I will repeat some good advice that I read another poster had written a few days ago to a person in your situation           Keep your clean time as Day 6   Day 6 is a huge accomplishment and one tiny slip doesn't need to negate the entire 6 days   Hold onto them   And down the line  when You have more clean time under your belt  adjust the amount of clean time to reflect your tiny wee slip and therefor be more honest with yourself   But for now      hold on fiercely to Your 6 Days   Make them grow  Please don't beat yourself up for it   The holidays are hard enough and we have added stress onto them by withdrawing from weed   Be kind to Yourself   You are doing great  You made an error in judgement   You didn't screw up   This is hard and in truth  what you did was give yourself a lesson in staying clean   You are a wiser person now  better equipped to abstain in 2017  I don't think that one bowl will bring back the heavy withdrawals   I hear you   From what I've been told from my many psychiatrists over the years is that prescribed medication is unlikely to relieve the desire for your own self medication  but we're all individual people  so who knows   And I'm just relaying my own personal experiences anyway  so I should probably fuck off   Sheers  This is my first day as a non drinker in 14 years  I'm 28   But I'm doing the damn thing  Not drinking today  For me  the secret is to recognize the craving and deliberately think about something else   It's a loop though  because of the habit and addiction   Thinking about something else amost immediately leads back to "hm  what to do   I know   Have a cigarette "    When you can get your thoughts to loop away from that trap you will be ok  Checking in  good luck everybody  I'm rooting for you  PM me whenever  Loads of strength for you  Sign me up please  thanks  Love this  luck is for the ill prepared  No I hear you  It's approaching what I call my 'trigger hour'  my usual hours of going out to buy alcohol are 7 10pm every night  so I'm feeling that usual restlessness   I may treat myself to some yummy food for not drinking  who knows      Is it possible for you to go for a long walk  or maybe that run  so what do you think about coins i got a shitload of em  You can do this  I'm with you in not drinking today  Sometimes in the beginning days of sobriety it becomes overwhelming to think about the future  and all that time ahead of us that we "have to" be sober  But I really have to do this 24 hours at a time  There was a time in the early days when I could only commit to not drinking  one  hour at a time  and I still resort to that sometimes   Just focus on today and suddenly it's not so daunting     I'm sober along with you today   We got this  the thought of smoking weed always come to me weather new year or any other day  earlier i used to think those who smoke are cool and now i think those who abstain are cooler   Thank you  Ive have been using for over twenty years   The shit you melt when you heat is not the drugs its the polymers and binders you do not want that shit in your veins  You say waste  No you lick  the powder all up no waste  I have read countless papers and articles not to mention videos on it and if you are a reg user who wants the safest course  Do not heat up pills   Now like Fash said some pills  you gotta cook and brown then grind etc but that is completely different   As for our powder here just add water and stir thats it   As for tar the only reason peeps are heating it is because its faster again you dont have to heat   Like I said Im a 20  year user here  I know what Im talking about  Happy for you  Definitely feel you on the depression  you expressed it quite eloquently   Peace and I wish you many more clear days  I'm curious why you stopped going   Unless you'd prefer not to share   I can imagine many of us will be in this boat at some point  And in total truth  the occasional over indulgence is not terrible  if you know that you can curb it after that one night   But I am also very glad you didn't enjoy it  if that makes sense  I'll raise my glass of water to you for a fresh start  I'm curious why you stopped going   Unless you'd prefer not to share    I'm with you   20 years  but still   Here we go   No luck required   We are forces of nature  I don't think being a biochem major makes you an expert in shooting up    If you're putting a tiny amount of drugs in a big doggy digger syringe  I guess you'd be okay  except for everything else that's wrong with that sentence  Gee  if that's what a loser is  count me as a proud loser  Alcohol is a great thing to lose  D Congratulations on 99 days   Keep it up    I went to the token club in St Matthews I think it was called  the last time I was in Louisville   Anywhere else you'd recommend next time I'm in town  Happy new year to you  too  I will not drink with you today  and I'm damn impressed by your fortitude   Haha and are you sure you want it to be yours  Good luck  You are not alone in this   Since you don't have to worry too much about the health problems with the vapor  I'd say just keep decreasing until you get to zero     You might even want to get a zero mg now and try it  you will fall 1000 times and everytime you fall you learn something that's the rule of life  never ending process buddy Day one for me  I am choosing not to drink today  When do the dreams begin   I want them   I have been looking forward to them   They show me that my brain is recovering   I still have some brain fog and some headaches but I need my dreams to show up  Have always appreciated your introspective posts from the frontlines of your personal battle stoday  Pretty spot on  Especially citing the above underestimating what can be accomplished over enough time  Sometimes looking to and planning for the future is hard because of dark unpredictability and personal inertia  So I looked to the past  be it a year or 5 years  tally the missed opportunities and I was given much better clarity on what I should be doing      Congrats on the progress  I post tampons  Not the source  Not drinking today or the next 24hrs  Thanks a lot  I will give it a shot  Yeah  same thing for me   Buddy   You don't have a drinking problem  dude   My brother was an alcoholic  HE had a problem   Me   But dude  we just had three strong ales at 1 in the afternoon  and we're planning more drinking later   Maybe WE shouldn't drink so much   Buddy   Man  you don't know any real alcoholics  etc    Turns out my buddy wanted someone to overindulge with  and I was him  and he was threatened that I was heading in the "wrong" direction   Good guy and all  but truly  good riddance to him and all the "misery loves company" crowd  Wild imaginations  Fuck yeah  First time trying sign me up  Hahaha   that ain't my problem   p Honestly  this really helps  Its good to know that people care and have been there before  Thanks for the words   24 hours at a time    Thanks Bd       gabapentin is something that is mentioned here quite often   Many have found great relief with it especially when paired with clonidine      happy NY my friend   It's a miracle  I feel the same  I think this is a really good idea  I need all the support I can get  and I think we can all help each other keep tabs on progress and have a support system built in  Maybe a group chat  FB group  or something here on Reddit   You are human  brother  We are still there for you   I had my own moment of weakness around 10 days ago  but that mistake made me realize that I was totally making the right decision  I regretted it even as I was inhaling  and I didn't even enjoy the high    That was a turning point for me  I know you are going through some hard stuff right now  We support you  We got your back  Sometimes you stumble  but as long as you are still going forward  you are closer to your goal  Happy New Year  Happy New Life   It happens  It may even happen again  The amount of times I've said 'never agaaaain' and then that same evening slammed a bottle of wine and 4 cans of cider     yeesh   The fact you're willing to try again is something  Congrats on the year and all the positive change    I won't drink with you today in celebration   Everything most certainly is not black and white   It is my experience that almost everything lands in the grey zone   Weed is not all good or all bad   Abstaining from weed has its down side as well as its huge upside   You are correct   It is all about choice   It is all up to You and what You want and what is important to You   Where do You want to draw the line   Be strong coyote     You got this    if You want it  "still a loser  Did you skip the wine  or are you still fat "  Sounds like you and your friend had a great time     One year for me as of today  I've been a lurker  but this sub has helped me immensely  so thank you   Last year I woke up and decided that drinking never made me have a better time  More importantly  drinking never made me a better wife  parent  guest  or host  The last half of 2015 had me finally using MyFitnessPal to watch what I ate  and I'd lost 25 lbs  Cutting out alcohol was the next step  and it helped me lose 50 lbs  in 2016    Since I stopped drinking  I'm in much better shape  mentally and physically  I'm more in touch with my emotions and anxiety  I'm so much happier than I was a year ago   I'll not be drinking with you in 2017   r stopdrinking  and I look forward to it  Cheers  If it were me  I'd go see a doctor first  I don't know what 'stage' you're at  and

were SO close   5 off  Carr helped me to quit three years ago today  No  but I'm pretty good at knowing how to dissolve things and how much I can feasibly dissolve in a certain amount of water   Funny  I had to start Kratom because of severe gabapentin withdrawal  Sign me up  Love this post  Yes  this is 100  in my power  It is 100  me no matter what happens  and it is 100  me that will get me through today without a drink  I will use the tools I've gathered here and elsewhere  mindfulness  meditation  delaying  playing it forward  etc  and I will make this a great day on purpose  I will not drink with you today     You too friend  IV had a constant craving and urge since IV been up  I'm struggling  but I'm going to keep fighting  It's crazy how they manipulate your mind  IV got half my mind telling me to just quit another time and to buy a pack  and the other half knowing I need to continue to stay strong  The winner was actually 9 Congrats Mr  Otter       Kidding   Fair enough   How long did you attend before stopping  That's great to hear I'm proud of you  Let's keep it up   "I didn't have a glass of wine today    ok I'm a loser whatever makes you feel better    " Congrats on the strong yet very accurate perspecive    you have it right  Happy New Year    2017 in tha house  Why do you masturbate without porn   Bitcoins    Worthless    Send em all to me  People with compulsive skin picking are usually obsessed with clearing their pores   I think the media does this to us to sell things   Men don't worry about cleaning out their pores   I put stridex red on my skin without looking and leave them alone   They fill up again anyway on our noses   The more we clear them the bigger the pores get   That biore strip stuff has permanently enlarged some people's pores   Look it up on youtube   Anything like biore strips can   Let the alpha hyroxides do the work   People with compulsive skin picking should NOT get close enough to a mirror to do that plus we trance out and destroy our whole face cause we can't stop   It is the nature of this disorder   Alcoholics shouldn't go in bars   total trigger   applies to us with compulsive skin picking disorder  we need to stay awaywith our own triggers   Stay away from that DAMN mirror   Voice of experience here   Took me a long time to learn that and stay away from mirrors  There is an awesome free app called Skin Pick  I use it and highly recommend it     I drink fairly moderately but frequently  and my self control seems to be slipping more as time passes   Drinking has become a primary coping mechanism for anxiety  and is starting to become a focus   I didn't drink to relieve anxiety  per se  but the rest of this passage rings true  Near the end  I would say that outside of work  drinking became a primary focus  to the point where I would avoid eating at a restaurant if it didn't serve alcohol  The time between "starting to become a focus" to "became a focus" was fairly short for me  a scary slide  the pull of which was both repellant and strong    When I started my sober journey  I would have said  "I'm glad I am starting this before I suffer any real consequences " but in hindsight  I know that I did suffer real consequences  lost time for one     Do you have plans to reflect on your feelings as you go through this month sober  That might be the most telling  I'm not much of a journal keeper  but I do find it to be helpful to write about this part of my life  as you say above  it helps to lay it all out     More importantly  welcome  I will not drink with you today      Edit  spelling Welcome  It gets better  day by day  Wishing you happiness   success  I will not drink with you today   Aw  That is a sweet thing to do together on New Year's Day  You are a full day ahead of me   You betcha this is hard but we almost got a week under our belt   My anxiety is through the roof too but it is starting to lessen  The dullness and depression is starting to lift though    are you feeling that too   You are having the dreams   Not me  yet  and I am really looking forward to them   Like you  my motivation to do anything is really really low   I have to force myself   We can do this   We will do this   We are doing this   We are tough as nails and We will get through this to the other side if We want it bad enough   And I want it so bad  I can taste the freedom   We kicked cannabis to the curb   I like that  Please only post when completely sober   this is explained in the  participation guidelines  https   www reddit com r stopdrinking wiki index wiki post only while sober   for this subreddit     We recognize that many people spend months "lurking" this subreddit while drinking  You are welcome to read as much as you'd like while not sober  However  for the sake of everyone here  and for the sake of your own recovery  please only post or comment when you're sober  "Sober" means "not currently intoxicated or under the influence in any way " I will not drink today  Grind the sugar to powder it will disolve  I dont get this arguement  Im saying its better for your health to not add heat  Tell me where do all those binders and polymers and talc and shit go if they are not on your spoon  Yes they are in the rig now  Thats what you want   Me  I am a painter and illustrator  I would crave wine when creative like you say  BUT often the wine would just replace the creating  or if I did both  my artwork was shockingly bad  Lovely   You can do it   I just celebrated 2 weeks in Hawaii without a single drop    in years past I would drink practically everyday  You will enjoy you vacation so much more without alcohol  You got this    I've done both  It's so much easier to lose weight than stopping drinking  When I stopped  I ate like a pig because I didn't care about anything else  If pizza could get me through not drinking  that was it  I gained probably 10 pounds on the first months   I think you're doing it right  One thing at a time  one day at a time   The thought behind it is if you're stopping drinking and trying to lose weight  a failure at once will make you think "what's the use  I'm a fucking failure  better start drinking again"   Congrats and I wish t you the best for 2017  And not being hungover for two days  then saying f ck it and starting the train rolling all over again   Feels good  man   Hey boss  congrats on your sobriety   Mother of two year old identical twin boys here  Sobriety feels so good this time around that I hope I can stick to it forever  one day at a time  Glad to hear that you are happy  joyous and free  that is my wish for us all    simply stopping smoking isnt gonna do much youll just find another outlet for your stress  your wrong  im a completely different person wo weed  the 'stress' your referring to NO LONGER EXISTS bc it was weed that was grossly exascerbating or creating entirely  all that stress   now its gone and my life is good  concrete examples for you  high i would eat two 10 inch sandwiches and dessert after that  sober i cant even finish 1 of those sandwiches  high my waist would always be large bc its difficult to eat right stoned every day  ive done it temporarily  but its harder to eat right so i evennntually would crak    im now spending less money on food so i have less financial stress i wouldnt work as much as i should  now i do so not only do i have more money from working more  but i also have more bc im not blowing it on pot  high i wouldnt consistently be as chatty and outgoing with gorgeous new girls  now that i dont have the weed to entertain me  i am  herb being fucking illegal is a huge one too as ive had a couple legal troubles for it  obv it should be legal tho  so thats annother key area of life where i now have zero stress I almost walked into my roommates room and asked for a drag from her vape pen after I couldn't fall asleep for a few hours but I said no  and I'm happy I did  I'm almost at 2 months  I will in no way consume alcohol today  Best of luck to everyone   Happy New Years  Hi  fellow 2 weeker  Great metaphor  love it so much I saved your post  Congratulations on two weeks  Looking forward to the adventures ahead  farther and farther from the shire   DO THIS SURVEY   I SHOULD HAVE REQUESTED A SCREEN SHOT OF IT BEING COMPLETED TO WIN  First day of the new year  checking in    I don't wanna argue anymore    They're not my drugs    Y'all been told  y'all been given a simple science experiment you can try at home to understand  if you want to keep doing it wrong  I don't care    Chairs fuckface  I don't think of myself as inspirational  It's just that I found a way to do change that works for me  That means we can all find out our own way   There's still a lot to improve in my life and next year will still be a year of change  one thing at a time  one day at a time  If I'm lucky and consistent  it will be like this until I die  One thing at a time  one day at a time  Happy new year to everyone  I want to get off of suboxone this year  I think I can do it  I've been on subs for two years come April   I started at 8mg and I'm at 4mg now  I want to step down to 2mg by the end of February  My sub doc  my boyfriend  and my mom all want me to wait until I'm less stressed to step down  but honestly I think now is a good time  I'm not sure that I'm going to be less stressed at any other time this year    I also want to lose weight this year  I'm definitely overweight and having the munchies when I smoke pot isn't helping  I hope to cut down on that too  Maybe once a week instead of the two to three times a week it is now  I want to start going to the gym but I have insane gym anxiety  always have  I'm so out of shape   Thanks  Thanks guys  glad to be here with you  Actually here  not destroying myself    Sorry about the title  on a cell phone and missed my mistake  Ha  so true for me  too   When I was still failing at moderating  I thought  "what if I just drink on Fridays " And then I realized that drinking heavily 52 times a year was still an awful lot   Hi   You can do this     Some things that helped me was reading "the naked mind" there is a link in the side bar and also filling up my fridge with lots of non alcoholic drinks   I got soda water  Juice  sparkling juice  gateraids  tea ect   Also  this sub  everytime I want to drink I come read on here instead   You've  got this   We are all rooting for you     I did the same thing  Tried to quit  gave in    boom DUI   That was my rock bottom   For me  I had to join AA and see a counselor to really keep me on track  has worked great  Not drinking with you  have a great 2017   Thanks for the support  Congratulations  Good luck Thank you for your kind words I don't know much about you sir  but it seems like it may be time for a lifestyle change  Thank you  I won't drink with you all today    Happy New Year     Woohoo  I feel like most of us on this site are most excited about that  Now we get to enjoy the rest of our weekend  I had a real cool night stress free since i didnt go out to my usual new years thing  Just me  a lady  and some studio ghibli  Good stuff  Did you try tapering off the gabapentin or go cold turkey  Congratulations   I helped a friend quit around 2016's new year and it's been one year since she last smoked  Surprisingly she doesn't even crave them anymore  Welcome    I like how you have written out the warning signs and not warning signs  I found doing a cost benefit chart a useful tool  and I repeated the exercise as I went along   My initial goal was 30 days  though in the back of my mind I hoped to try for longer  and as 30 days approached I had gained a lot of insight and extended my goals    One of the critical things for me was that alcohol had become central to my coping and reward systems  so learning to live without it took time and effort to find healthier ways  having alcohol 'off the table' forced me to find those healthier ways  Once I adjusted  which took me months  I've emerged a much happier and healthier version of myself  When alcohol isn't allowed in my driving seat  I get to focus on my priorities instead  and learned to value being fully present in my life   Best wishes for a dry January      pothead couch potato  this is poor form  i literally climbed mountains on pot almost everyday for decades see not earning money etc   smoking weed at the top of the mountain was very joyful    so bc 'this didnt apply to me exactly' i felt it took me longer to quit and 'wake up to reality' everything else you said is spot on  but this particular phrase irks me  its this imprecise  and shitty language that is effectively putting negative energy into the universe when the spirit of your message is positive  not sure what point im making here  hopefully you can reply and school me lol Yay for not drinking   I too raised a glass of sparkling apple juice   Although it was at 9pm we cheered the new year in on the east coat from the west cost so we could go to bed early  Lol I'm an old lady inside and wanted to sleep   Nice one on remaining sober  Happy New Year    I live in probably the best place to celebrate NYE and I went out with my parents and it was actually fun  Saw the fireworks and a few cover bands  I've been angry sad and wanting to use all week and I def wasn't looking forward to 2017 but I'm feeling better now     I think I want to move out  I finished college 2 years ago and am working and it's time  And I can't be a hoe at my parents house   that's my biggest issue   Personally  I would not allow anyone to light up in my car while I was in the vehicle    or out of it so early in my quit   I would hope that my friends would be much more supportive of my effort in staying off weed   Even if you didn't puff on it  the second hand smoke is directly in your face        unless the windows were down   That would bother me   I understand that you didn't get the urge to join in        this time      but what about next time   Personally  I set some boundaries with my friends   I don't allow smoking in my car or in my home of any substance   That is my personal space and I deserve respect   I can always leave the building or area if I am uncomfortable with someone's actions but if they are in my space  I can't leave   You are very early in Your quit and I am only on Day 6  so we are both not on firm terra yet   Guard your Quit   Your friends will understand and if they don't  well    are they really your friends   Your post is very positive and I loved reading it   Keep Strong    I don't know if there is a definitive answer  However  I do know that WD symptoms can come in waves  There seems to be a lot of variability with this stuff  I think the best way to handle that is to set long term goals and then work patiently towards them  Patience is key  Every time I drink I go into "fuck it" mode and usually just smoke  Didn't this time  Almost 4 months now  I will not drink today  I want to  I'm bored and in a good mood   But I will NOT drink today  I will drink my bottle of Schloer  eat whatever the hell I want  even if it's fattening  but I will  Not  Drink  Today  I'm sorry you had to fend off a yucky comment like that  but it sounds like you handled it like a champ  also  I'm totally stealing "sugar sweater " Good luck   I want to stop drinking myself too  Today is day 1 for me too  I have a goal set for now of not drinking at all in January  If I get through that  I'll reassess and hopefully continue for longer   Starting at a new company on the 11th  in a manager position that is more demanding than current one so I'm hoping not to smoke up before work like I do now Sounds like a great start for 2017   I'll keep today sober right alongside you  I love beautiful chilly mornings  especially looking forwards to going for a walk tomorrow    Me too  We can do this  Here's to a successful 2017   This is basically what I was gonna write  Good on OP for recognising the projection  but god damn  That is not okay  Same here  Day 1'ers Unite   Tapering  Cold turkey was impossible  and still is  Must take 600mg night or else I don't sleep  I just enter a twilight state where I'm aware of everything around me at all times  and thus not unconscious sleeping   One year finally  haha win  I actually feel like kind of a rock star that I have lem commenting in my thread  I'll save the rest for the saturday success thread  Sure I used to convince myself that I was a high functioning alcoholic  Of course after I got sober a while I realized I was barely getting by and was just deluding myself into thinking that  nope metal i also got ham not prosciutto though and maybee some bits and bobs  It wont help you in your quest for qutting however  there is a big difference between a set back and getting back into smoking    Ive failed quitting and gone back and the first one back feels very potent and your brain or at least mine quite quickly became a stoner again   In my experience you smoke one joint and your brain will start playing tricks on you to get you to smoke another one in a very strong way     Perfect  I was an emotional hodge podge the first 3 months  Hang in there  the feelings will get better  and they beat the hell out of homelessness   Well  everyone is different     When my brother makes fun of my inability to moderate  I make fun of his man boobs  Sibling love is the best   Sounds like you have a pretty strong plan    congrats and I'm not drinking with you today  36 and never been married  I do almost feel in kind of a rush now  I want to feel what marriage is like  That level of commitment  there's even kind of a rush thinking about her taking my last name too  So weird  oh well  Seconding heading over to  a stopdrinking  I also recommend checking out AA speaker tapes  There's some amazingly inspirational stuff there spoken by the people who lived the stories  I don't go to a lot of meetings but I always enjoy listening to the stories  So happy not to be drinking today  If youre hyperactive stop being lazy and go exercise till youre sweating like a pig dont be an asshole  theres no excuse for cheating   Whilst shes away I recommend gradually reducing the quantity you smoke for the 1st week and quitting entirely on the 2nd   Geezus  yeah  hmmm  need to get my shit together  Thanks for commenting     Grab yourself a badge from the sidebar area to the right  it really keeps you motivated when the days start adding up  and it can help you to easily keep track of exactly how long you have been succeeding  And stick with it  You can do it  Four diet cokes in six hours  I was up until four and awake at eight  Tired and proud of myself  I know you feel disgusting  but you're not  You made a mistake  You're a flawed human being with great potential  as are we all    Welcome to day 1 of your new T break   You gotta punch through  You can do it  Day one for me  too   Nice  so are you still intending to quit   I too puffed a lot of weed when in my teens before learning about other drugs that "worked better" for me  I definitely have an addictive personality  I have done a lot of work on that using an "all of the above" approach of AA  doctors  shrink  psychologist  rigorous exercise  I have improved greatly but am still not "cured"  At least the addictions today are healthier and aimed at things like work  good clean fun  and speed  the 0 60 kind  that is     Welcome and good on you for speaking up   Do you have an idea of how you're going to approach things  Congratulations on getting through day 1  I've quit a million times before  too  I kept at it  and I'll keep at it  I'll quit a million more times if that's what it takes    As far as your question about what else you can do goes  a few things that have worked for me so far include     Being on this subreddit as much as possible  In a way  this subreddit is my sponsor    Delaying when I get the urge  There have been at least two days over the past week when  if I didn't delay  I would have had a drink  I tell myself  "Okay  I'm just going to wait an hour and reassess this then " Then I repeat as necessary    Playing it forward  I learned about that here  It means imagining what it would be like to have that drink  then the second  third  and so on  I even imagine the good parts that might happen at first  It might be good for the first drink or two  but after that  it's the same old time wasting  doing stupid crap  the sort of hangover the next day that reminds me what alcohol really is  poison    This isn't really a tool  but I finally got sick of what I and others here refer to as "Groundhog Day"  not sure if you've seen it  it's a movie starring Bill Murray  If you haven't seen it  I highly recommend   For me  Groundhog Day refers to the cycle of waking up every morning resolving to quit drinking only to cave and drink the same evening  Rinse  repeat  The day I quit two weeks ago  I think I finally cracked  I couldn't do it anymore  Somehow  that cycle stands out more than the hangovers  It made me just as miserable   A walk and meditation sounds great  I think I will do the same  I will not drink with you today   Good luck  They were real  And if you think about it everything is just a memory some are just newer therefore more visceral   I had a dream that my best friend and I were smoking a blunt on stage at a high school talent show while playing music and the principal was pissed  It was weird  But yes we can do it  Thanks     You're right  we can   Thanks   We're almost sober twins   Congratulations on your 308 days   Congrats  just be careful about those sneaky cravings people tend to get after a year   Stay strong my dude  I second having an approach  You'll need something OTHER than willpower to do this  Check in  Meetings  Books  Podcasts  Audio books    Power on  Get up  Brush off  I won't drink with you today   Free activities to beat the boredom  1  the library  Too far  Check out Guttenberg press online  Or if you prefer  Librivox has lots of audio books   2  Walk  Walk  Walk   3  clean like a mad person  4  journal  I resisted that much 'me' out there in plain sight  resisted it vehemently  but it ultimately helped after I stuck with it for a few days   I've loved following your journey this past year  thank you for sharing  HAPPY NEW YEAR    Hi and first off well done kicking the cigarettes habit  I also quit smoking using a vaporiser and recently went nicotine free  It can be done very easily  I see you're in 12mg juice right now   honestly  I wouldn't drop to 0mg just yet  12mg is still quite high and there is a definite period of withdrawal  for me the first week was roughest   You'd be better off getting 6mg juice and stick with that for a while  then get 3mg  stick with that for a while and so on until you get to the lowest nicotine juice you can get  Maybe 1 5 if you can    Once I got to that point I bought some PG  propylene glycol  with no nicotine in it and some 30ml needle top bottles for ejuice  I then filled it with the 1 5mg juice  and every time I refilled my tank I replaced the 1 5mg juice with the PG  until it was entirely nicotine free  At that point  I switched to 0mg juice and I haven't looked back  The first week will be tough  as I mentioned  but it's nothing like cigarette withdrawal and if you step down the nicotine over time the withdrawals will be minimum  Best of luck to you  It's funny that you say that because the first thing I did when I grabbed them was smell them  lol  Who knows what I was actually thinking  Thank you for reading my rambling  I will not drink with you  Love animals  Go to the shelter and pet animals  They are good for your soul Na a dont want it again lol just had one joint to myself and wondering if i was back to square one in terms of withdrawal symptoms and such  Thank you  And no  going on willpower now   I read Allen Carr  This Naked Mind  and Alcohol Lied To Me last year    I loved those books and they helped for a little while    but it never lasted long     I drink about a bottle of wine and a six pack of beers daily  Oh I am 100  sure that I will never smoke again  It does not interest me at all lol   Honestly when people pressure you to drink like that I think you have full license to make anything up   Say you torched a police car the last time you got drunk  you get terrible  uncontrollable diarrhea when you drink  whatever   Good for you on not drinking  Thank you   Thanks  you're very nice   I have to work on not regretting the past  especially the wasted opportunities   Only thing we can do is not waste opportunities now right    Shit  I just convinced myself to go on a trip     Congratulations on 85 days   I'lOl raise my whiskey diet breakfast too you  but you can keep your damn Dewar's  I will not drink today   Happy New Year everyone  I'm not sure how it's wasted if it's in the syringe and then my veins  but whatever     Look  please stop this  You know NOTHING about me  my life or what goes on within it   I do not  nor did I ever say  that I was 'unique'  I said everybody's different  which they are  I drink too much  fully aware of this  I am hurting my body  fully aware of this also   I am sorry that you had a rough time   I am not you   Please stop assuming things  thank you  Thanks so much for the reply  I was talking to somebody recently at the gym and they said "welp  the e cigs dont have all the other gunk that real cigs do  Do you think your body has had enough time to adjust to life without all that gunk " And that's what inspired me to switch  Honestly  I wasnt 100  sure what level I needed to start with e cigs  but I knew I had to jump from the real ones  Thanks   I felt like it was rambling  but it helps to write it down   Congratulations on your 118 days   Drinking moar currently  vodka and pulpy orange juice  it's terrible  Fellow DFW fan here  I'll take the Capital T Truth any day over the fog that I lived in every night when I drank  Congratulations on your 2 years  Glad you're here with us  I will not drink with you today  Lol  Drunk you was probably really proud for finding such good hiding places  Rest in peace  other sock   Sounds like a great new years tho  grats  The weird part is i truly love these women  i can imagine entire lives with them  christmas next to a tree with them  valentines day  sunday mornings cooking her breakfast  My lips my promise but my heart is a whore    Yay  And I have 60 days today  Sorry bud  It's just the truth  Maybe it's just me  But I'm telling you what I experience  That's awesome    great willpower story  Quitting weed and booze together is also very impressive  especially because so many people look at weed as "harm reduction" as a replacement for alcohol  For some people  that is totally fine and they can handle it  others just fill one vice's void with the other at greater degrees  I think it's awesome you are committed to avoiding mind altering substances and sticking to your guns  Blizzard hired psychologists to the team to make this game addictive   I'm sure that they used another word in their conference meetings  like immersive or competitive or something    You can read my struggle with Cancerwatch from my fist submission to this sub until my 15 day report  I'm sure you'll be able to relate  I'm a bit past a year   I've had a lot of cravings  but I've associated cigs with so many bad things that they are just weird moments   Brain will bring up cigs and then quickly bring up how lame and terrible they are    Then I move on wih life   It helps associating even one with being back to the addiction and the grossness  There is a saying that a miracle is something that is above nature  supernatural   It is also said that to receive the miracle you too must ascend beyond nature  Thank you  I've been recovering for a long time from a difficult surgery  so having the energy and motivation to set up my workspace is wonderful   Functioning drinker to me was a window  I was doing fine while drinking so there was no worry or concern  Then it progressed to blackouts and being unable to stop  Had to stop Sure  i'll pack on another 365 with you   I'm with you  Fantastic   One of the hardest things for me is getting back into the projects I love   Care to share what you're working on  Thanks friend  Being sober is the best gift I've ever given myself  I'm gonna keep on keeping on  The Problem is i life in a Rural Area  There isen't alot of that movies  People  and also i do not have Freinds  When i can do something like running insted of running i ride my bike   there isent alot of people where i life  theres no movie theater  arcades etc    Oh of course this is one reason I quit  cos I knew it was only a matter of time be it months  years  decades  before I reached that stage  I think guysober was just offering his perspective about his own experience   You're starting here at day 1 and asking for perspective  from what I could tell   When you get to day 428 you might have a different take on it all   Either way  I'm not drinking with you today   Happy New Year    I was spending too much money  gaining too much weight  and I disliked the foggy head that I'd get 3 4 times a week from it  It disrupted my sleep a bit  too  It's interesting   I picked up "Easy Way to Stop Drinking"   It was not a perfect answer but the change in mindset was invaluable   I did eventually quit drinking  and now I'm quitting smoking   I would highly recommend the series as a starting point  No  I asked if anyone else here did what I did  What HE did was come into the thread and imply I thought I was special and above being called an alcoholic  I did nothing of the sort   He said he was 'drunk all the time'  I've never been drunk outside of the hours mentioned  He clearly drunk more than me and I am GLAD that he's fixed his problem  but he made judgments about me that were frankly  incorrect  Don't know about you dude  working out makes me even more horny Yup  alcohol will do all those shitty things when you drink in excess  Glad we're not drinking today     I have to reset my badge for the umpteenth time today as well    Everybody's sober muscles are weak at first  It takes daily practice to get strong     Hang in there  I'll not drink with you today  2 5 days is great  Today is a new day   What are you going to do with that whiskey  I would drain pour before giving in to temptation  How long has it been since you smoked   Yes  What you describe could have been written by me  Only difference is I would regularly fall asleep in front of the TV and hubby would wake me to tell me to go to bed     I have decided that I am drinking too much too regularly  My job is hard and I know that the 'fog' I feel due to the wine and not great sleep doesn't help me do my job  but I still do it well     I  can't do moderation   I am an all or nothing person  So after thinking about giving up drink for a few years I have decided to do it for January and keep going into Feb and take it from there    Not clear from your post what you plan to do   Apologies if I missed it   But good luck whatever you decide to do   All the best  What bothers me the most is my brain automatically assuming a cigarette is coming   My hand checks my pocket   Where did I put my   oh no You definitely aren't alone  lots of people have experienced Gabapentin WD  Luckily I haven't felt anything significant in the terms  I'm prescribed 900mg 3x a day but take about a week long break in between scripts  But I could see the WD being severe if it were taken daily for months on end  Thanks for tge reply  I went over this     I took 4 500 mg day for 3 years  So I'm certainly big pharma's guinea pig  This is sound advice  I had developed an annoying habit of punching holes right through my perfectly fine walls  Not very charming  I curbed that shit  cause it was rediculous  I managed to hole punch while laying down on my back  arguing in bed  Im not that bad anymore  still have a problem with my bedroom door though  Something about the way that smug fucker looks at me  just can't stop kicking it  Well then good luck to you too   But the decision has already been made  No need to apologise to anyone here PB  A lot of us have failed numerous times  I know I have   Personally I would pour that whiskey down the drain to get rid of the temptation  Hope you manage to get through the rest of the day  Either way  you will always be welcome here  Take care  x Love this      Happy New Year  Well  let's see  I have been able to successfully mother three  young  kids  I make their lunches  I'm their class parent  I make their dinners  I do all their laundry and I make sure to say I love them  I take them to and from after school programs  soccer  Pokemon Go contests  I do what I need to do as their mother  I am also a pretty OK spouse  My husband and I don't fight  We're OK  But  up until recently I also consumed a bottle of wine  sometimes a bottle and a half every single night for the last two years  Every day  I looked forward to my wine  I yearned for it every day  But I was still able to do my job  I never drove my kids to soccer practice drunk  I never took them to after school meetings drunk  I was never drunk during a playdate  although BBQs were another story   I did the job  I wasn't exceptional  If there were another sober mother  she'd most likely have gotten the raise and promotion long before me  But I did OK  I wasn't ever fired  No one ended up injured   I'm only 8 days sober this time  This time I have a plan that seems to be working  I will say  already  I'm a better mother than I was 8 days ago  I am no longer rushing to get them off to bed so I can finish my bottle of wine  I am no longer saying  "Just one book tonight  honey  I'm tired "  I can't believe I cut out reading books to get my drink on    I didn't have the energy most days to take them out to the park  or the desire really  But I would sit and watch a Pixar movie with them  pop popcorn and bring them snacks and treats  We'd cuddle as I'd sip my wine    Again  I'm on 8 days  but things are vastly different  VASTLY  Which means it's only going to get better  I've already noticed their attitude  as well as my husband's  has changed toward me as well    The VERY LONG POINT I'm trying to make is that I didn't know the ME as a mother until I cut the shit  And now that I have a clearer head on it  I realized how I could have done SO MUCH BETTER    I'm a distant runner  I'll use a runner's metaphor  Instead of simply finishing the race and crossing the finish linewhich I have always been able to doI am now setting personal bests every single time I run    But  yes  I would consider myself a highly functioning drinker  But I much prefer this highly functioning non drinker for the time being  She's setting personal bests left and right   Feel the fear and act with faith   After all  faith is simply fear that has said its prayers   Thank you    It's good to be clean    Still working on those character defects though    It's a bitch    Wow  painful    You'd understand if you were a drug addict    You're not  these people aren't  that's cool    I don't wanna fucking argue    This isn't cadebate    Some people got caught spinning bullshit  oh well    That's drunks for ya    No biggie  Ps if you put concealer only  no foundation etc   just over the spots lightly   put alcohol on you hands before using your hands to put it on a clean face and use a fresh new tube of concealer like Physicians Formula "Conceal Rx"    comes in a small tan tube  like a small neosporin tube   10 or so  it won't show and you will be fine   That's what I did  Have you tried the 30 Day Sobriety Solution  I downloaded it on Xmas Day thanks to a fellow SDer and it's been amazing for me     Mine are identical boys as well   How's it going at 2 yrs  Be sure to rub it in   It's less fun if you don't gloat a bit      Damn  that sucks  Are you in school  Dude I was driving all over looking for checkpoints    powerful Awesome quote  I should tape it to my cereal box so I remember it each morning   Yeah  don't do that  I'm a drunk like all of us    Cheers mate  It's an     Art  http   www lung org about us blog 2016 07 popcorn lung risk ecigs html   Didnt know much about it so I googled it   Thought I'd leave a link to the info   Diacetyl is bad   Mmmmkkk  also there are some other chemicals that cause 8t  The people who obsess about my not drinking are the worst  NYE was "C'mon just have a beer  you have to have a beer with me  have a beer buddy"  It's like  what the fuck is your problem  how does my having a beer have any affect on your fun times  Drop it  I'm drinking club soda in a Koozie  just imagine it's beer and shut up  I don't want a drink  who cares what my reasons are  Some people get so insecure around sober folks  In the past when I've just been taking a break I've actually poured out beer and filled the cans with water just to get people off my friggin back   You do know my DOC right  And my other sub  That Fash and I mod  Awesome goals  Qui  I wish you nothing but the best  2017 is gonna be a good year  I am a very calm drunk but weed makes me want to throw punches  Kind of opposite from most people  Is there an underlying reason for the anger  Alcohol doesn't make anyone angry  but it does shut down the frontal cortex that normally keeps our lizard brain in check  You know what you need  Your very own "bottle cap"  yeah but it's still bad for yo health no matter what age Well if you want to go the opposite route of drink moar  fuck the shooters get a few small flasks and fill em up from handles because fuck me  20 fucking dollars a day in shooters what in the actual fuck I mean for fucks sake seriously fuck Gotcha   If it makes you feel any better  I graduated Summa Cum Laude  have no debt outside of my mortgage  am happily married  recently earned a promotion  etc  all at the height  eh   one of the heights  of my drinking   So I understand the idea of functioning highly while also knowing I have a serious problem with alcohol   It's kind of like living a double life for me   My dad was the same way   successful and not many people knew about the drinking  but it caused major issues nonetheless   A lot of my problems start to abate when I don't drink  tried my hand at sobriety several times in the past    I feel calmer  more creative  less guilt      Stick with it   I'm curious to see what changes you see in your life because when your life is pretty functional some of those big tells aren't there  got a job  got out of debt  etc      But even after just over a week of not drinking this time I feel this flicker of excitement about being alive starting to come back again       I really recommend thinking about how you are going to achieve your goal   There are things you can do   If you want recommendations  look through the posts here  there are loads of ideas   Some things I experienced initially  and while I don't know your situation and everyone is different  I was roughly drinking the same amount as you each day  include difficulty sleeping  night sweats  insatiable hunger for sweets  boredom  and wild mood swings   It helps to be aware of these things so you recognise them if   when they occur   I'm not an AA person but others find it very helpful   SMART etc    For me  posting here a lot has been great  And the daily check in sets a great tone for the day   And I found a counsellor so I can address the reasons behind the drinking   I'd also recommend mindfulness   meditation to learn to cope with racing thoughts  frustration  and overthinking things   And maybe think about what you are going to do in situations that are likely to arise  pressure   questions from friends and family  stressful situation etc    Whatever you decide to do  you don't have to rely on willpower alone  for me  that's simply not enough  if you don't feel that's going to work for you   All the best  I hope to see you around here for a long time to come   And I will not drink with you today  When I stopped  I spent a ton of time here reading  posting and commenting  Those are all great for the moment to moment but I agree that willpower by itself is a tough struggle  I rely on therapy  but there are other resources   AA  smart and so on   People are willing to help   I will not drink with you today  You'll never catch me      Chairs  Yeah  I know people with 10 000 hours   I still think that it's not worth it to spend so much time in the game  though  With 1000 hours I could've refined my drawing skills  learned to cook hundreds of meals  or burned lots of fat  Certainly not  Her alcoholism is way beyond the point where she can use needle and thread  I will not drink today  I posted in another response but one other one I got lately was "I don't trust people who don't drink"  What the hell does that mean  Sober people are untrustworthy  Right because it's sober people who do all the fucked up shit we read about and talk about here  it's sober people who shirk responsibility  cause trouble  get in fights  make messes  etc  Definitely look out for those people  those shifty eyed sober people looking to take advantage of the drunks  The funny part is  I stop drinking because I don't trust my drunk self   I recently started with AA and my sober journey and yeah  the spiritual stuff in the big book is a bit off putting   I don't put much really any  faith in religion but I do have faith in people  my higher power is that gained through community and fellowship  I cannot do this alone  but with the support of r stopdrinking and AA I am not alone  I can do this  We can do this  I will not drink with you today  Cheers to a sober 2017   Take it 1 day at a time  and go get yourself some good candy  it really helps  Good for you  Happy new year   This was my second sober new years as well  I took a trip out to the lake with my girlfriend and a couple other couples  Instead of picking one unlucky drunk driver  I was able to make sure everyone could safely hop around to the different parties we all wanted to check out  It was a great night and I had an awesome time with everyone while drinking a couple energy drinks  We are all hanging out at my place now laughing about last night's shenanigans and getting ready to hit the hot springs  I'm very thankful for having such a great group of friends that understand my decision not to drink  I still get people asking how I'm able to have fun but I'm able to brush those conversations off  Congrats on your sobriety and have a great 17   It's going to be another great year  thank you very much for listening to my story  I needed to write it down and get it out   Read  Find a book that interests you and give it some time  It takes some time to transition from the constant audio visual stimulation that video games provide  but for me reading was the nail in the coffin of my video game addiction   This is day 6 for me and my mom   We both stopped on Christmas  that was our gift   We both are doing cold turkey   It's affecting us both completely  different   My mom says she's lost a best friend  so that explains her feelings mentally to me   Me  I feel as though I got rid of a back stabbing friend  so I actually feel pretty good     Don't know if I'm too late  but sign me up I used to play hours of Overwatch a day  and the thing about it is that like u doognmad2 I solo queued a lot and used it as a simulator to distract myself from actual things I was supposed to be doing instead of playing with friends or for fun without the competitive attitude for 1 2 hours a day   The fact that I viewed competitive gaming as such a big part of my life made me look back on all those hours and wonder  "What the fuck am I doing with my life " Seeing people approach their twenties thirties and telling me that they're no longer into gaming because they have friends and family  and seeing myself so out of touch with reality and the people around me make me feel like I should stop gaming  It's not the social pressure  I don't feel like I'm an outcast because I play  I just feel like I'm missing out on a very big part of my life because I'm playing  and it gets harder to moderate sometimes   I don't quit gaming completely  Most of the games I play nowadays are just for fun  and the only games I have that I don't uninstall are single player games that last 2 hours instead of games like Dota and League that can make someone play for up to thousands of hours  Occasionally I reinstall Dota 2  play a game or two  and realize that I've just wasted 1 hour and feel "eh  this is why I decided to stop playing in the first place"  Even if I won it doesn't really mean anything   The only friends of mine who still play games frequently are those that don't do well in school  myself included  and this is why I really want to take this whole thing seriously and snap out of it Can you not try to make friends there  I'm in America where most people are pretty friendly so idk how it is where you're at but most people are pretty nice  Go and talk to people about things you're interested in and I pretty much guarantee you'll make some friends   I don't really think there is a thing as "too much coffee   But the shoes on the other hand   that can get expensive   Cheers to not drinking  For the next couple of weeks   r cripplingalcoholism is participating in our yearly population survey   Please take a few moments to answer some questions and tell us a bit about yourself    https   goo gl forms GyV881lSdjynukUP2  Please see  our stickied thread  https   www reddit com r cripplingalcoholism comments 5fv5hb time to take the

cripplingalcoholism  if you have any questions or concerns   I've personally have been starting to take up to learning the ukulele Congratulations  That is so wonderful for you  Really proud  Keep it up  I'll not drink with you today  Best of luck   Totally understand    My sister is  12 years sober  I don't think I'll ever compare to the level of crazy drunken antics that she got up to  but after my college years and letting my health go to shit I've taken many extended breaks from alcohol  Now  when I reflect  I often end up looking to my sister for help and I just wonder how she did it  She stopped drinking cold turkey at 23  a time when crazy partying wasn't that unusual  I'm 33 now and go between months up to a year off from drinking and moderating well for a while  then drinking a bit too much  etc  I remember making fun of her for being a loser when I was just in my 20's and now she's practically a hero to me  It's funny how that works    Congratulations on your sobriety and good luck moving forward  Stay strong and maybe someday you can be the rock for other folks in the same place you are now   After being a smoker for 20 years reading that book made it easy to stop  14 years ago and I've never been tempted to start again   Give your husband my best   remind him not to have even 1  Absolutely  Strength in numbers  Here we go  Have a cold shower after working out   If you want to cheat then go ahead I'm just saying you're a scumbag if you do   I wasn't drunk all the time  I am bummed you left the thread  I was a lot like you  probably drank less than you actually  And  yes  I considered myself highly functioning  But I could have done better  That's indisputable  with myself    But I'm guessing it's KIND of eating away at you a bit  which is what was happening with me as well  SO you stopped by  I hope you don't go away  Many of us  all we want to do is help because so many people here before us helped us  Anyway  come back  I can see being sober would help me deal with issues I haven't dealt with properly  because drinking lets me avoid them   My personal goals would be  attainable     I wouldn't hurt the people I care about   I'd be a better role model for those around me   Drinking turns me in to a hermit  My social life would improve   I'd be happier and more satisfied with my responsible decision making   I'm at day 1  again  Making the most of today is definitely doable sober  Better late than never     D you sound like you've got a good head on your shoulders  That can take you far  Drink more water to get rid of nausea   eat things like yogurt and high Fibre foods like cereal   For some people eating fruit really helps too  Good luck buddy That poor soul at 3 20  I think I've been that guy  Congrats  I am headed that direction myself  Hoping to get back down to 180 175 in the new year   Just need to stop putting so much cream in my coffee     Congrats   Just remember that it's no friend at all and it will stab you in the back the first chance it gets   And it will come back to try to be friends again   Remember  it's an evil non friend We managed to find a detox mental health facility that will take her Medicare  We also found a rehab place that my state will pay for an in patient stay since my Mom's income level is low   I know the feeling  I'm on my third handle of whiskey in three days  I passed out early last night because I was smashed  Woke up at 5am and got drunk again  Passed out  Woke up at 3pm  Now I'm drinking again   What a great feeling congratulations     I lost 40 pounds with the help of  r loseit   Take a look when you're ready  I found some caffeine free tea helped my nausea  Keep trying to eat though  Even small amounts of food will help   Once this sub grew people started mass down voting people  Somebody went and downvoted all of my posts here once  IDK though  just a theory  OMG  "sugar sweaters" for teeth  This is awesome   Congrats on staying sober  I have a YouTube channel that I've had since 2009  I've been lucky that I have very few videos   20   but spent a lot of time learning SEO so I have something like 2 5 or 3 million views   Regardless  I'm kicking myself for not working harder on it  Most definitely attributed to smoking  I could probably be making the salary I do at my job right now if I wouldn't have given up so many times  No longer will that be the case  I've made significant progress in the last 3 4 weeks and don't plan on stopping  According to my flair  today would be 366 days  Even attended an open bar wedding where I was the best man and didn't touch any alcohol   D I know it's in my head but I feel selfish when I don't drink   People are at the bar and I'm drinking a soft drink and I feel like people think I'm being a dick   Then I get lecture after lecture about moderation   I don't have enough ammo in my mind to not drink and I'm looking for other peoples suggestions or personal reasons to realise why it's better to not drink  Congratulations  What a way to start the new year     Thanks  I am quite motivated today  I'll jump on Reddit as soon as I have cravings  Thanks  Thank you    I could care less about whos right  You are spreading bad info on heating pills  People get sick and die from bad info like this  This is the only reason I joined this convo  cause shit like this gets people hurt even dead needlessly  Happy New Year  I will not drink with you today    Hi5 for nearing 30 days   Thank you  Way to go on 88 days   Some friends are really fucking tolerant  I slapped a close friend in the face on NYE 2012 because     I actually can't remember why  but at the time it was very important  Happy New Year    I've gota lovely cross stitch that says "complaints to the cook could be hazardous to your health"  Its great  The one I've been to starts with a lot of readings about the 8 fold path and then there is a 20 minute guided meditation  We alternate weekly between reading from the book  Journaling and having somebody share their story   The meeting is open for sharing after that but it doesn't go around in a circle or anything   if you want to share go for it but nobody is forced to  People generally share how they apply Buddhism to their recovery or some aspect of their meditation that night  We close it with another 5 minute meditation  I wouldn't be too concerned with not  being a big enough drinker tbh they rarely focus on their history of drinking and instead focus on their recovery and what they are doing to move forward  Thank you  Happy New Year  Thank you  I'm lucky that work will be really busy  My plan is to see the crazy ones on a school night with my "work early" exit plan  Friday and Saturday are for the ones I know are sober  or at least will understand what I'm working with    Happy 2017 to you  too  Sign me up   We're so insightful when we're drunk that we have to push it down everyone's throat  We're so not like that old drunk sitting on that stool everyday babbling uninteresting stories to a bored waitress    until we realize we're that old drunk  Congrats  Alcohol is such a sneaky source of calories  I don't miss those either   Happy new years  Im starting off with just 41 days under my belt   Look forward to having a great year  Just a suggestion  my daughter and I do this  we advertise our Uber free ride promotion code in facebook groups we are in  she leaves cards around places she eats or frequents  and just any way to get your code out  You can even put it on the uber website and people will use it  For every person that uses it you get a free 15 dollar ride or off a ride if it more than fifteen bucks  Takes a little work but my daughter goes back and forth to school exclusively free    You sound a bit like me  in that I've been doing it for years  drinking most nights although mostly not a massive amount   The reasons I want to stop are I'm tired  I need to loose weight and I've become more stressed and negative  feel like I'm not the person I used to be  much of this is down to alcohol   I'll join you in not drinking today  sign me up   Thanks for the recommendations and for not drinking with me today  I looked up an AA meeting today  and went all the way to their door  but I didn't have the guts to go inside    I will definitely hang out in this sub a lot  and hopefully I can get enough courage to talk about my problem with people in real life  Boredom will be a big problem for me I suspect  I am not sure yet how to fill my evenings that I usually spend drinking  The main my opioid alkaloids have a short half life  2 5 hours for one and 3 5 for the other big one  But  there are plenty of other alkaloids that seems to have serotonigenic effects  Also norepinephrine  So kratom wd is a combination of mild mu opioid  ssri and snri withdrawals  These may take longer for your brain to normalise than the opioid receptors Sound advice   Congratulations  It feels so great waking up happy  34 years deserves extra applause  i will not drink today ' You don't know shit    Reported you to  r opiates    It's embarassing that you're modding such a sub    Fucking cornstarch binders ain't killing people you fucking twit  1  My health  hangovers ruin my eating and exercise habits  2  My mental health  now I try to actively deal with my problems instead of numbing them   3  I want to be responsible for all of my actions   4  I don't want to wake up in the morning with no recollection of what happened the night before   5  My bank balance   6  I want to know that I can have fun

encouragement feel free to send me a pm  You got this  It's the first day of your new cigarette free life Congratulations   What an accomplishment   Weed does seem to be a young person drug  I know a few people who smoked loads of weed in their teens  early twenties and don't like it any more  even though they still drink  I quite often wonder why this is  Maybe because as you get older  you become more serious and anxious about life and want a drug that just makes you feel good  rather than making you feel strange and possibly more anxious    Absolutely  I'm with you   r addiction That's fucking great  This is all I do for fun  Whiskey and cross stitch  One day I hope I can just do this full time and not have a grown up job    Man  10 years  I can't imagine myself doing that  Congratz  "I'm on a diet" or "I'm on antibiotics medication" seem to be easy go tos to shut the conversation down quickly   I have recently transitioned to "my body just doesn't tolerate alcohol well anymore "  If asked for more details  I'll mention I was having issues with my blood pressure and sleeping   which is true although it's just the tip of the iceberg   That's been working pretty well for me  Haha wow  that's a new one   Sign me up please Signing in  Im in  and this time ill CRUSH IT  Congratulations   That is amazing    I hope I can do a year too  day 1 for me    What are the most common symptoms associated with ssri snri w d  I hadn't considered that it was working on two levels  but that makes sense   Because ringing in the New Year by drinking what is classified as a poison makes one a winner     Thank you  I'll try the diarrhea one next  I'm getting one year on New Year's Day 2018     hopefully Girl  you're a better man than me  Can't say I'd have been able to hold my tongue

drink today    Sign me up please  A book called LA Ice  About addicts in rehab  Very good  have read it several times  Not how to get sober or even sobriety  Just about two people  ups  downs  love  fear  hope   when you break down quickly get rid of any remaining crumbs so you won't be tempted to smoke again I've been trying to get sober for ages  This is my day one too  Good luck to you  I'm exactly the same  Good luck  Best of luck to ya  but I'd imagine making a living off it would be a bit destructive   Constantly taking orders for shitty whitisms that like a tide against rocks slowly erodes your joy of casual disdain  Great job  I have some friends who are in the Colorado cannabis cultivation business and have access to some mind bending weed  My MO was to supplement here and there with it  When I decided to get sober after Thanksgiving I decided that sober meant sober  no smoking  no edibles  nothing  A head clear of any intoxicant  other than caffeine  of course  is my goal  I'm glad to read stuff like this to know I'm not the only one  Again  good job  I've found that when I'm hungover I'm pretty tempted to crack one out too  To be honest  I've been pretty frantic with trying to keep busy doing different tasks   like planning cooking or doing exercise  Got some new cookery books so I'm quite enjoying testing out the recipes   I just keep on remembering how depressed I was after during PMO streaks  To be honest  PMO ing really didn't help the depression I felt when I was suffering a hangover anyway  Awesome   good to hear  hopefully she is ready and willing to participate  she will need to be fully involved in the treatment program or she will get booted  people at Medicare will be reviewing her progress and she will get kicked out if she is not actively participating in the program  great start and Happy New Year  Fucking Pokemon   Happy 2017  everyone  I won't drink with you today  day 1 reporting in Very inspiring and helpful  thank you so

subscribe and share my channel happy new years Thanks for the suggestion  Yeah I need to find a better alternative to caffeine  doesn't help that I work at a coffee shop  haha  I remember reading somewhere that an okay tasting  but packed full of nutrients smoothie makes a noticable difference Why does drinking destroy friendships  Because you vaped  If your friends can't accept weed  why are you friends with them   This was a pretty serious intervention  All of my help is predicated on her making it through her treatments and making her meetings and appointments  It's going to be hard  just about everyone else in her life is an abuser or enabler  I really don't know how much of a chance she has  but she'll be dead in a couple of years without any help  She went from 220 lbs to 105lbs in two years  She's a shell of who she used to be  Thanks for the thorough response    Oh  I don't think I would ever take the plunge and pursue it  I have a job that I actually like at and architecture firm  Sewing is just really therapeutic for me  taking orders would probably fuck it up for me  95  of the time it is vitriolic shit that I make look pretty  Another hobby is sewing dog clothing  I swear this makes me sound like way more of a saddo than I am   who voted my comment down  explain why you negative asshole  some of us are actual alcoholics  You are a fucking idiot   Shit  I've done some of these stone cold sober  i life at America to  CA In fact   where i life  There isent alot of people  it's a small rural area  i attempt making some sort of Friend ship at school but it never worked out  In town there isent alot of people and and allot people who are at my school are stoners            I actually posted this morning about how I woke up with an urge  but I had to be at work in 30 minutes  It doesn't always work out that way  but having any obligation like that can make it so you simply don't have time I know nothing about Pokemon  Haven't even poked a man   Brilliant stuff  thanks for posting   I'm going to check out the wellness plan in the morning  looks good  Good luck  seems you have answer s to many of your own questions  may have to leave the job  Plenty of people will tell you  "Oh you will never make it if you don't quit"   fuck them  if you really want to stay clean you will  if you don't you won't  it's really as simple as that  build your support network  go to meeting s  work the program to the best of your ability just try to focus on your situation  to many people in NA AA try to lump every body together stay away from them and find

awesome way to start the year  My wife and I just had a nice long walk in the winter sunshine too  Keep on rockin' in '17 Normally when I don't text people on holidays it's because I assume they are busy with friends family  I'll speak to them another time  or I'm trying to avoid my phone while I spend quality time with family  Don't take it personally  I'm sure if any of your friends family read this they'd be heart broken to know they inadvertently hurt your feelings   Not drinking with you today  Love this      Happy new year  Thank you  And thanks for sharing the 8 dimensions of wellness  Looks to be a great resource   I began my journey today  and I know that New Years resolutions are a bit 'cliche'  but for me they hold great significance   Reading this sub the last few days gives me inspiration  and you lot all seem so happy and encouraging  I am looking forward to it  I will not drink with you today  As somebody who found this sub last January  I'd like to say to those just finding it now  The members of Stop Drinking collectively altered my whole perspective on alcohol in 2016    My aim was to take a break for a few weeks  then moderate  Members here helped me realise that moderation is an impossible dream for me  When I control it I don't enjoy it and vice versa     Many areas of my life have improved greatly during the last 12 months  If you're reading this knowing that you need to change the relationship you have with alcohol  stick around as you're welcome and the answers you seek probably lie within the posts somewhere   Also know that I will not drink with you today   So there seems to be a lot to work through for you here   First off  I'd suggesting speaking with your sponsor  and definitely value their opinion much higher than mine in regards to what I'm about to tell you   What it seems like is that you're working on sobriety at the same time that you're working on loving yourself  and that's not uncommon  and I've found that sobriety and loving yourself are often correlated in measurements of success   You are an amazing person who would be a valuable friend to have   You just don't believe this yourself yet  and you may have used alcohol to hush your fears about this insecurity   I was lucky in that I was rather comfortable with myself when I first started trying to quit alcohol  but I had been in the military  and I can tell you that before the military that I didn't have that confidence to value myself  and I hid that insecurity behind alcohol and weed and would pass out on other people's couches and consider them friends when I barely knew anything about them  and they about me   I don't even think about them now   I also had very good friends  but imbibing alcohol and drugs was the primary aspect of our friendship   These friends disappearing hurt the most  and I think we both fought to keep the friendship going  but in the end  there wasn't much we enjoyed doing together once alcohol was out of the picture  and we both just stopped trying   Finally are the friends that I had before that stuck with me   Some of them didn't know what to do when they were going to be around alcohol and if they should bring me along or not   Initially  not bringing me around was probably the best call  but they talked with me about it  and I could make the decision if I could handle joining  or if it would be something that would key into some of my triggers  i e  drinking games  and I would politely decline but clearly state that I was touched by the invitation and would enjoy joining them for other events   And eventually we grew together and they became better friends with me being sober   This is a bit off the rails  but what I'm trying to communicate is that I think you're lamenting the loss of friends that may not be able to stay friends with you as you go through your sobriety  and that's okay   Right now your sole purpose is to focus on your sobriety  to focus on you   Over time  you'll become proud of your sobriety  and wear it as a badge of honor  and as something that defines you  and this is the best way I've found for my sobriety to end up protecting me   I don't worry about people that wouldn't invite me to a party because they're concerned about my sobriety because in the end  that's my badge protecting me from those kinds of parties and those kinds of people that believe everyone at the party should be getting drunk   Meanwhile  you'll be making new friends  and developing stronger bonds with friends that like you for you   And you will  and I swear to you on this  you will learn to love yourself and to value yourself  and to value the people that are honored to call you a friend   They say something for working out at the gym  that you should think of during these dark days   I didn't say it would be easy  but I'm telling you that it will be worth it   Good luck   Stay Sober   One day at a time     P S   Your mom sounds awesome  and you shouldn't worry about spending too much time with her because she values you when you're sober   You should build upon that  and hopefully you'll be able to see yourself as positively as your mom sees you   Good luck  Congratulations on your first step towards a smoke free future  Wow that is awesome and I am needing to do the same thing  I put on 40 pounds   don't sleep because I drink too much  I care for my mom full time who has dementia so it's taking a toll on me   If you have any advice to help me get started please let me know  I am going to try the calendar with the X that shows each day I have not had a drink    I really appreciate the help  It looks like our local detox facility will take her medicare  I was worried about having to pay out a ton just to save my mom's life  Valium is very nice to have in place of booze  Also very addictive  Is rehab an option  Sounds like you need want to dry out but can't trust yourself to do it  Is your promise to her a strong enough motivation to actually do anything  Also   if you're going to jail it's a good idea to detox asap because I don't think they will be sympathetic to your withdrawal symptoms at all in there   That's my 2 cents  good luck fucker  Very low abv beer while in public  I dislike being noticeably drunk in public  Nice pale ale  Kissed a pretty girl just after midnight  total stranger so that was nice  At the party   neat dark rum  which is unusual for me  Quite nice  may make a habit of it   Yourself   Edit  yes it was all very nice  I totally agree   I have realized one of my pitfalls was that I knew I had an issue and needed to change  but right now I'm having this unusually stressful problem and alcohol is really helping me cope and I will work on drinking less later   But my a hole addict brain could make any little hiccup into something that qualified as unusually stressful  so by its logic  I would continue drinking my way through all of life's inconveniences and challenges   It actually worked the same for happy events and celebrations   I can't quit NOW  we're about to go to the beach with friends   Since I was pretty functional and didn't have much for what others would consider rock bottom moments  so I had to pick a time to hunker down  tackle it  and be ready to be uncomfortable for a couple of weeks   Turning 40 was a good excuse  and a couple weeks later  I overdid it on a camping trip and had some undesired consequences which made me feel emotionally and physically like crap   I seized that as my rock bottom and used it to motivate me to quit for just a month to start  but it's gaining momentum for me   I'm glad we were able to take that next step after acknowledging the problem   Happy New Year   I will not drink with you today  Thanks  Try telling me that ten years ago  Hence the 'day at a time' adage to keep one's perspective in check  Hey congrats on a year   Have a great sober 2017 too  alright  im in for the month  sign me up starting now  It's really encouraging to hear your story   thank you for sharing  Alcoholism runs rampant in my family and I'm the only one  even in the extended tree  that doesn't drink  Even though my family doesn't understand my sobriety right now  I continue to go high even when they go low   It all comes down to choice  a lot of good suggestion s that I won't regurgitate  taking a break maybe in order  That is how I manage  I also don't drink and stay away from opiate s  I use a few weeks a month and that's it  I can control myself enough to pay bill s and take care of my other responsibilities  long gone are the days of ripping and running  arrests and Institutions are no longer in the picture nor is a real habit  it's how I manage Welcome back   We all regret drinking at some time or other but I have not heard one person say they regret getting sober   Though to be fair I have heard many wish they could drink moderately but for most of us it is an all or nothing deal and I would take sober EVERY SINGLE TIME  Enjoying waking up sober and refreshed is always nice  I wish you all the success in making 2017 your sober year  I'm British and moved to America four years ago  I had no idea that shots here were considerably bigger  No complaints  Happy One Year my friend   The intense malaise  andehonia  depression anxiety adrenal like fatigue  lack of mativation all seem to be from the ssri and snri aspects of kratom withdrawals  This is all just my thoughts and small amount of research though   Thanks  Happy new year   If I hadn't found this sub I'd be in denial and still be drinking so it's great to be here  Checking in They're the devil  straight up  I'm starting to believe that no one short of dying or passing out from agony should be given opiates     It was a hard learned lesson for me  but you really can't take care of anyone if you don't take care of yourself  It helps to remember that someday  children will be adults with a lot more accurate hind sight  Things that seem tragic now  could very well be understood later  Good luck  man    Man   that is such a refreshing take on the subject  I went to my first rehab when I was 16  43 now and man has my perspective changed  I've been on again off again over my life  I know that I am fully in control of myself and my life  I make the decisions  I stay away from substance s that require assistance to come off of  opiate s and alcohol   How are your cravings now  I can really empathise with this   The last time I stopped I had it every day from my work colleagues  I've left there now as the atmosphere was toxic  People would actually rip it out of me every day because I'd not got smashed all weekend  Typically  we don't give advice here because stopping drinking is really a personal path  I can share what worked for me though      one day at a time   you don't drink for one day only  Some will write in the daily check in you can find on this sub  I did it through planning    planning   who will I meet  Where will I go  Who could ask me to go out for a drink  How will I refuse  Those questions covered 90  of the situations    sober people  sober places   I didn't meet with people who drank  I didn't go in bars  The idea is to get alcohol as far away from you    read and write on this sub often   at first  I came here multiple times a day to read and write  I generally wrote one post a day but commented on other threads like a mad man   As you can see  there is no awesome genius trick to stop  I just made sobriety my main focus over anything everyone else  I didn't care about my family or my SO  all I did was getting sober  Then  family life got better because I wasn't a fucking drunk  This is a battle in your head  You're brain is used to you feeding yourself while high  You just gotta mentally work yourself to eat  If you can get yourself to eat breakfast without being high  lunch should be a little easier  and dinner will be easier than that  This is my experience at least   You just gotta work your way into it slowly maybe and the more often you eat  the easier it should become   It definitely doesn't help  that's for sure   Yeah expanding my kitchen activities are very high on my list of to do's Look at you two   Couple of old timers  Its the inner fighting between rational brain that nows porn is bad and old brain that says "Watch all of those nude women you hear " Congrats  Let's not drink together  "Going smoke free for a year "  You'll be smoking in a few days  if you last that long  Either you quit or you don't  This addiction is so powerful   Hell yeah start the year on the right foot   Instead of being a guy who plays video games  now you're gonna be just a guy who's in school and hits the gym   The motivation will wear off but discipline will see you through   Do it to it  My 1 year chip from Ninjilla was a wonderful thing to open this morning   I told my son and his girlfriend at breakfast that I'd gotten it and they both High  Fived me  Great start to the New Year  Lol    http   i imgur com ZY2V0AF jpg   You kids couldn't find your ass with both hands  and you don't know shit about drugs    Lighting up my inbox with your silly posts doesn't change that   Post a motherfucking source for your claims    Something legitimate     I'm almost positive these symptoms are not completely related to kratom use  Firstly  you've only used for 4 months and at relatively low doses  Unless you're having some sort of allergic reaction  this is quite odd and unsettling  I'm sorry you're going through this  I'm used for over 2 years  mostly at least 30 40g daily  I've gone cold turkey from that amount and this time I'm tapering  Both ways  I've never had a reaction as bad as yours  To be honest  I think you should see a doctor  Also  try to focus on your diet  exercise and meditation  I would try to avoid other meds and supplements for now just to be safe  Stay strong buddy  I would maintain on your dosages for a few days  unless things get worst when you take kratom  then I would just quit cold turkey since you're already at such a low dose  Take care man Yeah  I've been out for four days  and it's so noticeable  Very strange  In almost every one of my previous quits where I've made it more than 4 or 5 days  I always got to the point where things were looking up  maybe a pound or more was shed  I felt better  etc   and I started missing whatever the hell I thought I was missing out on  Maybe I missed numbing myself  missed being goofy during that first drink or two  missed not having to deal with reality for a few hours every night  In other words  I forgot that I actually hated numbing myself  doing or saying stupid crap after the first couple drinks  and wasting my life by avoiding reality    I haven't counted the number of reasons I have for not drinking  There are lots  And despite seeing the benefits already  I'm sure I've lost a couple of pounds  I don't wake up with hangovers  I waste less time  the reasons I don't drink today are the same  For example  I gained weight around my midsection because of drinking  That's already looking better  but I know that if I start drinking again  I'll lose that progress  That reason doesn't just go away  nor do the more important reasons   And if anyone treats me worse because I don't drink  that's not a person I want in my life   OMG people are real twats  If someone asked me if I had shingles I'd probably say "No  it's          " and make up a word  Then say "Oh it's catching by the way  you shouldn't be so close"  UGH Going through a break up  Split up on Christmas Eve  I moved from Chicago to Maryland to be with him  I'm in the suburbs and don't drive  so am really isolated  He went back to his family in Ohio for a few days  I am drinking myself into total oblivion  Whiskey  my dog and horror film binge  That's nice that you had a nice night   Thank you for engaging the sub   It's one thing to walk in to a subreddit with daily activity  it's another to see it has active moderators who are passionate about the success of its members     Let's do 2017   Happy new year everyone  I will not drink today  So awesome        Be proud   Awesome resource  VE  Thanks and Happy New Year  Personally  I don't have qualms with a moderate amount of coffee  Just with the pile of garbage I feel like after energy drinks  I invested in a nice 1400w blender a while ago and yes  start with some spinach and kale  then add whatever fruits you like  use some frozen  too as heat can kill some of those nutrients  and it is definitely a great  natural  and guilt free energy boost  Well there's no way to know you're an alcoholic if you've never drank  I don't say that to encourage you to drink  but just to say that you're in a position that I often envy  I sometimes wonder how much better off I'd be right now if I had stayed away from alcohol altogether  However  if both your parents are alcoholic  there's a strong chance you will be too   if you start drinking   There's definitely a hereditary factor in alcoholism addiction   On top of all that  you're never going to truly escape your feelings by drinking  Alcohol will only provide a temporary and illusory respite from your feelings  If anything  once it wears off  your feelings will come back even stronger than before  That's how it was for me  I don't recall ever waking up from a night of drinking and thinking "Wow  I'm glad I got drunk last night  that was totally worth it " It was never worth it the next day  it only seemed to be good in the moment while I was drunk   You'll be better off facing the feelings you're having and trying to work through them  That's a whole other topic of discussion though  I hope that helps  and if you want to talk about whatever is bugging you to drink  I'm all ears  I fell out of favour with the ideas and beliefs that were behind the AA program  I also felt like it was very cliquey  I tried to go to different meetings and got involved in service  but it stopped feeling right   I was also confused  I was told that if I stopped going to AA meetings  I'd relapse  That sounded irrational to me  Like  why would I need to continue to go to meetings for the rest of my life  Could I find something else that worked for me  that kept me aware of my problem  but didn't require me to somehow KEEP identifying as an alcoholic day after day   I was also realizing that people on SD had never gone to AA and had stayed sober  Then I started to learn and read about substance abuse  and the theories behind it   and I realized there was more to do than a simple disease model   So  it was a lot of things that accumulated over time   Now I work in the substance abuse field  I volunteer with substance abuse organizations  I got training in peer support  and use SD as my support  I am happy and feel more well rounded than I did when I was in AA  Day 3 here  It gets easier  Me too  Also  I like your username   Early January 1  sounds like it counts to me  Total agree  His books were part of what helped me quit both those things  where are you at with your readiness to work on it   If you are ready  there are lots of places to start   If you are not ready  you gotta work on that first   You can lose the weight  or just stop gaining  it's just about controlling your calories   You have to find another way to deal with your stress  other than food  then you can do it   I'm doing weight watchers and having a lot of success   Let me know if I can help  Admitting to other people I wasn't drinking during my first week or two made it a lot easier   I just said "I am not drinking because 99  of the time it isn't a problem  but that 1  isn't worth it" to people who pushed it  Dude   whenever u get that 'just once' itch  please hop on here and let us remind u of what u don't want  Let those of us sitting on massive Kratom habits remind u of all the BS you are now free from  Good job with your quit   I wanna be just like u someday   Cant argue with an idiot   Goal number one  hit a year sober this march  Goal two  get my license back in April  Goal three  pay off my court fines before April  Goal four  have fun  Do cool stuff  Go to more concerts  Stay with Chris  and make him and me happy  Save money  Some other shit  Mostly I just want to be happy and I am so I'm just gonna keep doing that   I liked everything about that story except for the busted bong  I broke my pipe yesterday so it's back to the bong for me  unless I get energetic and grab some skins from the store   Those fireworks sound magical  I'm honestly scared shitless about a career change  and that path literally has no room for games   But I say bring it   Games are a waste of time   Excited to work toward something I can call a profession  Hey we just came back from a walk as well  What a beautiful way to start a new year eh  I'm thinking of you  I'm certain this whole sub community is thinking about you   55 000 people thinking of YOU  Happy New Year my friend   I like the way you think  I will do my best to   make   2017 a good year  Days 1 4 were fucking hell  I will not drink today  I have missed a few days due to the flu  I am still not well  but I am here and sober  Happy New Year to all my SD family   Thank you for your post  One day at a time sounds ridiculous when you start  On the one hand  one day at a time is  hard   but on the other  you know it needs to be long term  But after a few days  it makes sense    Forget about tomorrow  and yesterday has happened  Just focus on now  and it all seems much more achievable  Shit yes you will This is another giant red flag with kratom  It is completely unregulated  It could be sprayed with anything in the growing process or contaminated somewhere along the way  we have no way of knowing   My Xvendor claimed they "tested routinely for purity"  but then an independent tester claims to have found desomorphine in the very product I was taking   Scary stuff    Thirty hours with no sleep  Are you on other drugs    Bodies are incredibly capable of repairing themselves  get clean by any means possible  I would expect the best if I were you  Your sister sounds like an asshole   Good job   Stay strong  Still here still sober     I'll probably spend every second when I'm realised here haha  1  I'd like to have a family one day  but I would be no good as a dad as a drunk   2  I exercise enough that I should be trim and handsome  but instead I've got fat   3  Sleeping through the night rules   4  A variety of health things  including a family history of diabetes  and recurrent acid reflux from the alcohol and the Advil I use to treat hangovers   5  I have severe depression  Booze feels like a fix but actually makes it worse   6  I have to start acting like an adult about my career   7  I've got to the point where I don't do relationships because I feel guilty about inflicting my drinking habit on any potential partner  That blows  but it's going to remain true until I get this thing under control  Thanks for the link  Hoser in Chief  Cuddling with my littles has been better than anything I could describe today  Congrats on your year  Welcome back  Lol  I've been fighting a cold  I wake up with a pretty nasty sinus headache every morning    I'm woozy  I have no appetite  and it takes me an extra hour to really come to my senses   Of course it does  Of course while I'm trying to get sober do I get sick with what mimics a hangover every freaking morning   Oh well  still beats the alternative    and at least this way I get some sympathy from my spouse  Thank you  and thank you for your support this last year  Let's do this 2017  Awesome  Haha I almost tagged this with our Hoser flair  but didn't want to scare away the Canucks  Too low BAC causing GABA receptors to be over stimulated  I think  I think you come down in "layers" or at least that's how WD felt to me  On the rare occasion that I've gone cold turkey  I've felt awful by the ext morning  but it gradually got worse for about three days  There are a whackload of people celebrating one year today who joined us  Hell   u ninjilla is sending out one year coins to all these people as well    Welcome to SD  I hope you find what you need here  LOL I laughed so hard at that and had to tell my husband   it has my vote for SD quote of the day tomorrow      Thanks  that's a really great reply and I can identify with it all very well   I wish I could plus ten it  Me neither  But then I didn't reach out  either  We had a quiet night in and were in bed before midnight  I was up and at 'em early today   Hang in there  I know I had a pretty rough time emotionally for the first few weeks in this round of sobriety  It's better for me now   Congrats on 5  I'm sorry you are suffering the heartbreak of alcoholism in your family  I had an one alcoholic parent and can't imagine if both parents were abusing  No wonder your feelings are overwhelming    I'd get help from a therapist  Also  reading the book  Adult Children of Alcoholics  by Janet Woititz gave me insight about myself  Also  Alanon is a support group for friends and family of alcoholics  See  r Alanon  Meetings are almost everywhere  You can't change your parents  but you could learn how to cope with your own emotions with help from others   I'm in hospital for drinking for five days straight  nearly going into cardiac arrest and malnutrition  My mum still thinks I'm not an alcoholic or have a problem with alcohol     Every journey is different  but I find this place to be unique in that it really helps me to find people who have been through what I'm going through  that were in a relatable spot    in some ways it can be scary because you see the struggles people who have been sober for quite a while still have  and still amazing to see when people are feeling weak they can come here and get lifted up by virtual strangers who only want them to make it through the day sober  I felt a little weak at one point last night and jumped on this sub and it gave me renewed strength  its just an awesome place  This sounds awesome  Good luck  Sorry to hear you've had a tough time of it  Most CAs lurk between highs and very lows   it's certainly not a glamourous lifestyle  But it is what it is  the key is being able to slow down when you need too    Planning withdrawals is absolutely essential  get that figured out then it's much easier  On my calendar I have marked out when I taper  and when I stop for  sometimes for many weeks   Received an unexpected bonus so don't need to work for a little while  there's two ways it could go        Thank fuck for my calendar     Yessir   Weird   The other night I dreamed of rolling a joint so big and fat that it looked like a potato   Weird   Didn't smoke it   just rolled it    Congratulations  keep it up  you're a hero to many of us  Thank YOU  And I teetered about posting this for anonymity sake    but I feel this change has been such a gift  It feels bigger than me sometimes and I wanted to share to give encouragement  The physical transformation is what you can  see  and that in itself is huge  The spiritual metamorphosis is nothing but miraculous  to me   Something in me   bigger than me  changed one year ago  My wish is to get to a place where I can offer a hand  and help others where I once was  It's lonely and scary and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy  Blessings to you 2017  My dad got sober when I was a senior in high school  Your mother sounds enmeshed in alcoholism  Get help for yourself by going to Alanon meetings  It's a support group for friends and family of alcoholics  See  r Alanon  You can't help Mom but you can take better care of yourself   family health money clarity goals relationships self respect Thanks  Seriously  I stumbled on this subreddit and I'm seeing a lot of internalized self loathing   Moderation is key to maturity  total abstinence is a crutch of those who lack self control  Congratulations and well done   I haven't drank since the evening of November 8th   It was at that moment that I realized that the condition that was helping give me an excuse to drink would still be true in the morning   I read "This Naked Mind" and started stopping   I'll not drink with you and the other fine people here today  I was going to die  I wanted to die  That scared me   Great work  especially during a tough time of year    I won't drink with you today   Nice work  I know I have had times where I wanted to stay sober more than doing or drinking something with the crowd  It has been the right call in the end  At first  I panicked when I thought of 6 months  I thought I never could do it  and it was true  I couldn't get 6 months sober while panicking about it  That's how "one day at a time" helped me  http   addictionblog org author scott   You might want to check out my blog willpower      highly overrated   strategies      definitely the difference for me  Great job stopping  Don't give up on making friends  man  You just need something you're interested in that other people are also interested in  Do you have any hobbies  Programming  Join a computer science class club at school  Reading  Join a book club  Just look for things to occupy yourself with that other people are involved in  Next time you do a group project make an effort to be friendly to the other people in your group  say that joke you thought of  It's really not that difficult to make friends once you start approaching people and getting some social skills     Living in a rural area is tough but it doesn't mean you're doomed to having a boring life until you move  Get a bike  go hiking  cut a trail in the woods and build a smoke spot  or literally anything else if you plan on completely quitting   Get a job if that's an option  You'll have income  something to do and an opportunity to develop social skills and make friends  You are a Sad little man   Have you ever heard of the blocking feature  The best  Awesome  Congrats  How long after you quit drinking did you start focusing on weight  if at all   Oddly  I was pretty good at sticking to my diet when I was drinking but since quitting I've been terrible at it  the season of carbs doesn't help in the least  How do you know you can stop after 1 or 2  That's me three months ago  You can get over this shit  I promise   And yeah  BSO in my best friend right now  Life is so much better not chasing kratom for something it's never ever gonna give you anyway  It's like some kind of abusive lover  Here's to a year  one day at a time   Congrats  This is fantastic  You have really turned things around and now you have a family  You are living the American Dream   But be careful  I'm catching up to you  I'm only 900 laps behind lol Go ask this question on the sub  like i said  Heroin is water soluble  This is ridiculous  You clearly wont listen to us so ask the rest of r opiates   Well  are you still dosing  Since you've only using a month  you're probably on a short runway to normal  Yes  yes we are     I've generally been feeling lost after walking away from a tech job I hated after working in tech solely after graduation and knowing it wasn't for me  And the last several months have been not knowing what to do with my life  Right now I'm just telling myself I can't have anything without sobriety first  so that's where my focus will lay    Man  a case in the fridge and a bottle in the pantry would be hell for me  Gj  Great job man  Losing weight sure is a lot more of a pain than putting it on  huh  Keep it up though  you are gonna be even happier when you make a post like this again next year I know I need to stop slow down  I've been getting the shakes the last few weeks  and that's a new thing  Things are tough right now  Not even sure how to go about stopping  I've no support system and live in the sticks  My Mum is an alcoholic  so this life isn't unfamiliar to me  but this reality is hard  Whiskey is a lot cheaper than therapy  Checking in  all the best everyone  I have been sober for only a few months but it has been the easiest for me to quit this time for one main reason  I realized alcohol was not doing anything for me  I think people are always better off without drinking as there is really no benefit to drinking that you can not get through cheaper means  Not only is it an expensive habit but it wreaks havoc on your body by disrupting your neurochemistry and endocrine systems  Aside from the reduction in serotonin  which actually makes depression worse  and the lowered testosterone levels  it can also increase estrogen levels and make you look less masculine  It damages the liver  causes cell death in your nervous system  and ultimaly it never addresses your original problem  I got a DUI when I decided to get drunk due to some girl trouble I was having  Drinking did not fix our problem  I just woke up hungover with a new problem    I really do not think you will confer any meaningful benefit from drinking  You are always better able to resolve your problems with a clear mind than you are while intoxicated  This is not even addressing the fact that you  like myself  appear to have a predisposition to alcoholism   This is my problem  I say Beetlejuice ONE time and that Voodoo looking skull guy shows up  sprinkles some powder on my face and suddenly I'm 5 drinks in with a tiny head  and I don't remember going to bed or how I got there  Thank you    Thanks   It's great   They know their alphabet  saying   recognizing upper   lower case letters     they can both count to 30   Other than being bright little boys  they couldn't be more different   One is very openly affectionate and loves anything with wheels  monster trucks are his favorite  and the other one is more serious  loves to read and is the boss of the house       I also have an awesome teen son who is almost 16    the three of them   my wondetful husband are absolutely the light of my life    To get rid of blueballs  urges  to feel good  because it's normal  healthy  etc    Masturbation isn't the culprit my friend  Porn is the culprit  Porn is the problem   Bloody hell   I felt sorry for myself due to the odd friend or colleague making a comment   I'd sot him down and explain you are serious and why etc and how he made you feel   He won't be taking it seriously hence the comments   If he was serious then you'll be having much more serious conversations  For the next couple of weeks   r cripplingalcoholism is

Please  contact the moderators of this subreddit   message compose  to  r cripplingalcoholism  if you have any questions or concerns   I used to set myself targets of 365 days  six months  three months  whatever  I did that for years and years   For me  a year is too big to comprehend  I honestly can't tell you if I will be sober on the 31st December 2017  I can tell you I'm sober today and I will make it to bed tonight without drinking  Tomorrow will take care of itself   The thing that you will hear most of all around here is "one day at a time" and the reason for that is because it's pretty much all we can do  Good job man   That's wonderful   I'm certainly proud of you   Let's not drink together today  Happiness clarity health family freedom progress pancakes This is encouraging  thank you  I wish I had more mamas like you around  I'm the only alcoholic in my group of girlfriends  There used to be quite a few more  but when I quit drinking I lost a lot of friends  My girlfriends now have my back and support me fully  however they don't really know what it is I'm going through so there's not a lot of empathy  I don't talk about my alcoholism a lot with them  because it's not relatable  I suppose this is what a good therapist or a good home group is for  Something I plan to work on in 2017 Look into phenibut  that always helped me a ton when needing to get sober for a while Apparently we're stopping smoking     I hate those 3 4 days   My new years resolution is to make it to a full year  God willing I'll have that in March  My other resolution is to get through my steps   I also want to be the best possible framer  parent  significant other  son  and brother I can be  I will work my hardest to fulfill those  If people were hones about it less people would be in this situation  I feel myself getting physically addicted within two weeks of taking it  It fucks up my sleeping schedule and makes me a night owl   It feels so good  and it gets even better  I promise   Willpower and hope are fabulous if you have them  but if you happen to feel in low reserve of either  please come check in for support    Great decision  Stick with it  You are awesome   Excellent work   And yeah  I don't miss being the most drunk person doing the dumbest thing either     Let's not drink together today  Day one going strong Triple digits messed me up because then I staryed thinking of how far away 4 digits seemed and by day 105 I was drinking again  experience been so far   Worth it   it is like finding a real root problem instead of treating the underlying symptoms   I had no idea there could be side effects to using it at the time and things didn't magically get better either   I feel like the adult self of my kid self  I used to have a lot of confidence and energy when I was a kid  I used to be a different person but porn changed me a lot by taking way too much energy from me   I don't hate porn  I give it its respect  it is too powerful and I can live without it  Day three I think  Honestly this withdrawal is really light  Considering getting more before the end of the break though  Just bored as hell   Good point   Lots of times I think we blame weed for everything  when in reality its the overall lifestyle that encourages smoking that we should be working on as well   Ask yourself what you think your new life would be without smoking  and start it now regardless of whether you're still smoking   Positive things will hopefully crowd out the smoking  I'm thinking of you too  I really admire that you're staying strong and sober despite your mood right now  Keep strong  You've taken a huge step to improving your life  I'm not drinking with you today   I wake up on the floor near my small computer desk  and start drinking again and the next thing I know   a week has gone by   No more  Did they just assume you were because you were in a jovial mood  and because they probably couldn't tell the difference  being drunk themselves    Funny     Good work not being tempted   Tell us how you did it  It's not as bad as methadone  but the time frame is similar because they have long half lives   You can expect to feel pretty shitty for possibly up to 3 weeks or so   It won't start bad until about 72 hours after the last dose  Day 5 10 will be the worst usually diminishing from there   Your legs and possibly arms and shoulders will twitch badly and you'll feel a lot of aches and pains  sweating  nausea   Loperimide can help minimally  Immodium   Good luck  hang in there  Keep it up  r petioles Did you do it   Do it  Psst   those 50 or so days were not a loss  we get to do what we want with our badges  and you're the one you have to be accountable to  You clearly learned a lot during that sober time   I'm glad you are able to rise and enjoy the first day of the new year without any ill effect from alcohol   Here's to a beautiful year in recovery   Opiates absolutely diminish libido and once you're to the point of shooting opana  that IS your sex life  The sidebar tapering guide is really good  Apply water to the shitty beer  you'll be fine in 3 4 days  drink water on top  and above anything eat everything in sight  I wish you and your mother well   happy to help assist whenever needed  Checking in  It's raining outside and I'm home alone  but staying strong  Happy New Year everyone   Vaping is about 95  safer than smoking  It's also worth mentioned that cigarettes have about 750x the amount of diacetyl in them than vape juice  There are also many juice companies that don't use diacetyl at  In fact  it's rare to find someone who does use it      There isn't a single documented case of popcorn lung caused by vaping      Sure  fresh air is what should be in your lungs  but compared to smoking a cigarette  vaping is way safer and you won't smell like shit    Not only that  with vaping  you can control how much nicotine you ingest which makes it the easiest cessation method to ween off nicotine    I was a near pack a day smoker for 10 years  Thanks to vaping  I and both smoke and vape free for many months now            This is good advice   It feels so good to be the responsible one  doesn't it   Excellent share  and good job on continuing your sobriety into the new year  Not going to drink with anyone today   Day one      Ohhhhh fuck      Thx  any additional advices  I thought about transfering from gaming PC to a laptop    some say it helps  some say not  The laptop would have a weak components if I would buy it  If you still think you're missing something you'll probably go back eventually  The trick is realizing you're not  Drinking doesn't work  I don't mean that in a judgemental way  It's just how alcohol works in my experience  It convinces you that you need it to enjoy life until you realize you don't   I for one definitely want to quit forever  I don't need weed to relax  Actually  as a matter of fact  weed doesn't even relax me  It makes me tense as all fuck  I second  u SOmuch2learn's advice  I also know firsthand how difficult that situation is   My marriage did not make it either  there were other issues  to be sure   but the most important thing for me to have success in my sobriety was to focus on taking care of myself  whatever that looked like     Check in to let us know how you're doing  won't you   This group is such a great resource  Such a wealth of information in that link  thank you  This compliments my self crafted program of sobriety and personal growth  I found that I am responsible for my choices and those reflect upon me  the person I want to be and the path I follow  SD never fails to amaze  It's all here  It's a worse idea to use mega doses of Imodium  There's a growing number of cases where people experience permanent heart disorders from Imodium   Its still part of the immersion  I remember spending hours and hours watching MMO Starcraft videos  Don't take it personally  What's the 30 day book  Science always seems to be a common theme with addicts lol  I've met people who know intimately about the chemicals they use and the science behind it that becomes an obsession and a love in itself I guess this idea of using what scientific evidence they can find to justify their choices also exists in recovery    I never said there was anything wrong in getting help for our addictions and we find what works but all I ever seem to read is somebody who swears by kratom but can never stop using it or somebody who swears by 12step recovery but has never finished the steps and never stopped going to meetings  If you use another drug to feel better or use colored keychains it's all the same a little rush to keep you going another day    People can do what they want I just dream of a day where I don't need anything else but myself to survive  Where I don't depend on something to make me feel good  I wasn't even bashing it but you say anything negative about 12step and people all come out the woodwork like a rabid pack and attack from all sides but as soon as somebody comes for help you put on the nice face again and tell them to get to meetings because it's the only cure except it's not   Tell those people you know to contact the CDC or at least see a doctor  because they would literally be the first documented cases of popcorn lung caused by vaping  I also would like to note that cigarettes have 750x the amount of diacetyl in them than vape juice if it's even a vape juice that has diacetyl  They are rare    Strong work right here  Oh  you   At least gorging on the sausage and hash browns won't leave you in any embarrassing situations   unless you go into a food coma and take a nap at the table     I like to hope if I make it 10 years  off dope that I manage to make a life for myself and don't spend my spare time still sitting in a room talking about my first world problems   AA will probably be preferable to NA   The principles can be applied to any substance   NA is a bit more rigid in that they consider the use of any substance  sometimes even prescribed meds  a relapse and the fact that you will never be considered "sober" there if you smoke  can be frustrating  Lovely  I took a nice walk this afternoon myself  it was raining in the morning   The sheer pleasure of being outside and able to enjoy life clear headed makes the whole thing worthwhile all by itself  Keep up the good work  I'm with you  Let's take 2017 by the balls  Strong work on one year  Congratulations  One day at a time  My reasons evolved over time    I found doing a cost benefit analysis a particularly useful tool to get them out on paper   Initially some of the things that tipped the scales to motivate me to stop drinking were     My health was suffering  hangovers  sweats  amongst others  and I feared for the unseen damage and risks to my health   I recognised that I had a lot of rationalisations for drinking  and that ultimately they were hollow excuses and lies   My life was revolved around alcohol in an unhealthy way  and it wasn t getting any better   my addiction was deepening over time  Once I got sober  I then strated to value the benefits of my not drinking   these include     Being present in my own life   Being present with my loved ones   Putting my priorities first   Better self care   I am happier   I have better discipline to work out   I am healthier  In addition to all that  I'm doing better financially  in my career  and even completed my degree  I am a better version of me when alcohol isn't in my driving seat  I am free   I had the exact same experience  Honestly  I had much more fun being sober than being super drunk like I would be prone to get  I was able to stay up late and hang out with everyone  Glad you had a great time  Happy New Year to you  so itchy right now   whine    I was soooo petrified before my first meeting   I didn't find  r stopdrinking until a couple of weeks into my recovery  so I didn't really have anyone to share my feelings with   I'm glad that you're able to post about it before going   and look forward to your return to tell us all about it   It will be great  I'm sure   I've got 200 hours in Overwatch  maybe 100 150 in Fallout 4  The first 100 hours of Overwatch were a blast  but I am no longer having fun  I am only still playing to climb up the ladder   I have had great experiences on both games  but I'd rather get more into my tech hobbies  The time I spend in my tech hobbies will make me happy now  and will continue to entertain me for years to come  The time I spend on Overwatch only matters now  and will cease to matter when the next epic game is released  Because most people here don't have the ability to use it in moderation  30mg isn't that high  I've heard plenty of reports going above 100mg  I don't think I have to worry about that especially for short term use Happy New Year everyone  The first thing I want to say is this  There will be things that will happen this year to all of us that will be out of our control  but the rest is up to us  Just like the serenity prayer  accept the things you cannot change but have courage to change the things you can   I had such a memorable NYE with friends from New England  It was the first time I actually trekked the city of Philadelphia since I was in active addiction  It has been years  Luckily all the good stuff for sober people is in the nice sections lol  We hit up touristy spots for fun  saw the early bird fireworks at 6  ate in China Town  visited my friend's cousin  and took the train back to go to my friend's aunt's to watch the ball drop  We did go to bars and I have been DDing a lot more lately and found that I am pretty smooth with my red bulls lol  I honestly hate what alcohol does to my stomach the day after and have no desire to get drunk anymore  This Winter break has been so memorable and I'm so glad to be back on my feet socially after basically isolating save for a few people since 2013  Seriously the best Winter break yet  I am over the moon with how happy I've been  On top of being a heroin addict I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder in 2013 and have really come so far  I've conquered it with meds and therapy  have avoided the hospital  and have worked and gone to school  which the doctors at the psych ward suggested I may never be able to do  FUCK YES    2016 was a great year for me  It was the best year I've had in a very long time  I am hoping 2017 will be even better  I don't have to start the new year with "I hope this year won't be as bad as the last " I start it with  "I hope this year will be even better " I have so many goals  too much to share  but I am very excited to start school again  I have 3 weeks till the semester starts and I plan to make the most of it     TL DR     Life is good  Serenity now  Give recovery some time   effort and it'll pay off   Well done  I hope I'm where you are in a year's time   We are animals  Thank you for your response  I appreciate you taking your time to give your thoughts  I am not involved in AA presently    there is really no benefit to drinking that you can not get through cheaper means  Could you tell me a few examples please  Appreciate the message  Happy New Year  I don't comment on your posts much but I want to say I read them every day and I enjoy them  You are on the right track and will definitely hit and year   then some  Happy new year  Thanks for the replies  To clarify some things that I rushed past in the initial post  I'm a pretty smart guy  not to brag  but to give some context  and yeah  these symptoms are very strange and I can tell that the majority of this is from the kratom  but I'm a bit concerned  like I mentioned  that I've hit a threshold and metaphorically "broke" something that may or may not be naturally repairable or I just have some hormones way out of whack  I smoke some cannabis  buds and concentrate  this isn't the problem though  throughout the day to help with things  but it hasn't been helping much with these problems  I'm okay off and on  but experiencing slight withdrawals also  since I've really dropped my dose down over the last day and half or so  I've had 2gs today about 12 hours after last dose   4g   after about 7 8 hours pretty good sleep  which has been rare until the past couple days  when I've slept way more and way more peacefully than I really ever have   The 30 hours awake was forced since I had a lot of stuff I was doing that day  lazy things  but things   I wanted to flip my day night sleeping hours around  and I just didn't want to sleep yet  The kratom I've been taking is Club13  I will mention  this is some of the best stuff I've had  it's strong and doses are probably comparable to higher doses of some other brands   and has been pretty good to me through many bags  including this one  until just the other day  I think I may have just overloaded some areas and am experiencing some crazy emotional distress and hormone imbalances and at this point  I'm thinking that I'm "probably" okay  but I'm just taking it easy for a few days here and really tapering way down  It really all got bad after that 30 hour day where I had 16 20gs throughout and then slept for about 12 hours  tossing  turning  awake a lot  nightssweats  hotflashes  classic withdrawal stuff  so didn't actually sleep much  and then got up the next day and within about 15 minutes  ended up so angry and in a rage for about an hour until I forced myself to dose because I knew my mood was just crazy from withdrawal after the crazy day before  I was mostly fine for a while  but then got very abnormally tired  which basically continued until I went to sleep for around another 12 hours  Then I got up  was very angry and irritable again but not raging  dosed  awake for around 6 hours  then slept for another 12 or so  Then I was up for around 12 hours  2 doses in there somewhere   then slept for around 8 hours again  Then I got up  went out and when I had my dose this time  this is when things got really ugly for my emotions and I had the weird "attack"  I got really tired after that also  This "tired" also comes with some weird leg feelings  kind of weakness  and my right arm gets weak  so those are very weird and slightly concerning symptoms  Then I came back home and slept for about 7 8 hours  That was last night  and I've had one 2g dose since then  about 12 hours later   I've been mostly okay  just experiencing normal withdrawals today  I will continue to report progress for anyone interested  Happy New Year Bone        I was also "high functioning" for many  many years  had a home  good job  family  no legal trouble  etc   but I was utterly miserable   And toward the end I could feel myself slipping lower and lower   I'm glad you're able to face reality before it gets any worse     Checking in here daily was a huge support in my early sobriety  hope to see you around  Yessss   I love this   Congrats on your 49 days    Its tough to make it through the New Year and all   Meetings are good  but sometimes they suck   If you find yourself in one of the later ones just go to another one   Other than that tidbit there is nothing quite like being in the atmosphere of recovery   It's saved my life more times then I can count   best of luck  Thank you  I appreciate that     How crazy is that  Upside down world indeed  I will not drink today   What better way to start the new year   Lost Prophets   4am Forever  https   youtu be baiPs 904As    Just a disclaimer that I'm aware that the singer of this band is in prison for being a pedophile before anybody comments  It's still a great song and the lyrics get me   Lyrics   Yesterday I lost my closest friend Yesterday I wanted time to end I wonder if my heart will ever mend I just let you slip away  4 AM forever  Maybe I'll never see you smile again Maybe you thought that it was all pretend  All these words that I could never say I just let them slip away  4 AM forever  Why don't you hear me when I'm calling out to you  to you  Why don't you listen when I try to make it through  to you  Goodbye  goodbye Goodbye  you never know Hold a little tighter  4 AM forever  Maybe one day when I can move along Maybe someday when you can hear this song You won't let it slip away  4 AM forever  And I'd wish the sun would never come It's 4 AM and you are gone I hope you know you're letting go It's 4 AM and I'm alone  Why don't you hear me when I'm calling out to you  to you  Why don't you listen when I try to make it through  to you  Goodbye  goodbye Goodbye  you never know Hold a little tighter  Why don't you hear me when I'm calling out to you  to you  Why don't you listen when I try to make it through  to you  Goodbye  goodbye Goodbye  you never know Hold a little tighter  4 AM forever    I've had anxiety off and on for as long as I can remember  But being on zero substances as of about a month ago has made it barely noticeable  And what's really strange is how I can differentiate  body anxiety from emotional anxiety  I'm fully convinced drugs of all kinds create anxiety generated by the body  At least now that I'm straight  I'm still weird lol   I used alcohol to deal with social anxieties  Instead  I take ashwagandha daily to reduce stress and help with anxiety  It is clinically proven to reduce cortisol levels    If you're feeling down in the dumps exercise is one of the quickest and easiest ways to improve your mood almost immediately  and it costs nothing   Sign me up please  This time I'll get it right    TaxSlayer  Never thought about it in this context before but there's a lot of bad messages re  alcohol in our  GT  songs cheers lore   Our fight song  "Rambling Wreck" literally contains the lyrics   "Like all the jolly good fellows I drink my whiskey clear "  "I wish I had a barrel of rum" and "I'd drink to all good fellows who come from far and near "   It's also been a school tradition since 70s that the band plays the Budweiser song  "When you said Budweiser you said it all "  at the end of the 3rd quarter   There's also a cheer we do that ends with   "Fight   Win   Drink   Get naked   "  All that said no drinks at game  despite being in club level  or last night   Am at day six with what should be worst temptations of year behind me and passed all tests  Welcome  Good luck  Sign me up son  I'm kicking 2017's ass Congrats to all  Great inspiration for the rest of us  I'm not in Colorado  but even if you don't find an agnostic group  you may be pleasantly surprised to discover that not everyone in AA is religious  and that some people even talk about that without judgment at meetings   I'm an atheist  and I've attended meetings for over three years without being converted        A thought   meetings that advertise as LGBT friendly are often quite tolerant of religious diversity as well  even if they aren't labeled as such   I hope you find a meeting that works for you  Hey healthy sober twin   Late 2015 I kicked drugs but didn't work on my recovery  I didn't think alcohol was a drug and I was waiting for some magic to happen from abstaining from drugs  I didn't    End of January 2016 I found myself handcuffed after driving with a  205 BAC  It was the best thing that ever happened to me  2016 was a terrible year  I had no job  no license  and I was a mess  But it was also a good year  I got sober  lost 30 lbs and I'm in the best shape of my life   and I addressed my depression    2017 is looking good  I start a new job after being unemployed and unemployable for over a year  I'm clean and sober for 1 year soon  I have a great life and it will only get better so long as I stay sober  Congratulations  Haha  that's my new favorite stat   percent of year sober  Happy new year to you too  Don't waste your time Fash  Dude's always looking for a fight somewhere lately  Such a good feeling  isn't it   Happy New Sober Year to you     Noice  I'm struggling with my additctions  but I hope to join you soon   YAY    Happy new years back to you   3 Ooof  I've been there  I know how real the pain is  If there's a way to ease out of the relationship more permanently please try it  But believe me  I know it's not easy and it can get overwhelming and seemingly unending  And the lies  The lies are so maddening  The drinking and meanness is scary and saddening  And the lies are so maddening because we feel like they think we are fools  And sometimes we feel like fools  Anyway  I don't mean to speak for you  just know that there are people out there with stunning levels of empathy  Sending good vibes to you over the interwebs   Thanks  Yes  I have been thinking about trips  too  Why not  Carpe diem  Ha ha ha   That's the funniest thing i've seen all day  Thanks brother  Appreciate the suggestions  We will definitely get a new theme on the sub soon  Agree on the memes  The google hangout is a good idea   I don't think I have the capacity to organize it right now but maybe someone else can take the lead on that  Stayed up later than I should've but still managed to wake up early to catch some football with coffee  It's only 2pm I feel like I still have the whole day ahead of me  Nope  Still sober   I worked night shift at the hospital  and toasted the new year with my co workers using only sparkling grape juice  One of my friends insisted he saw me pouring wine into my glass   I'll post a reply here when I've written up my plan Congrats on your 3 years   Congrats on a sober orbit around the ol sun  Keep up the great living  I went from 12 to 6 to 3 to 1 5 to 0 to no vaping  It's hard though  You still have to want it and you need the willpower to fight through the cravings    I'm vape and smoke free for many months now and that's thanks to vaping   I'm 7 months sober and alcoholism runs in our family as well  My mom  when I quit  was HARDCORE trying to get me to continue drinking with her  To the point of begging me to go to the bar and just drink a little or she wasn't going to speak to me anymore  However   while she is not fully there  she attended her first AA meeting last week through all of her own effort  I never comment on her drinking because I know for me  it had to come from my own self awareness  So essentially  me quitting has allowed her the freedom to find her way as well   D Good job     We went skiing this morning  We arrived at the mountain at 8  Not many people there  It was a beautiful day that we were able to take full advantage of   Awesome job   I already posted because he wouldnt  And what do you know  Not ONE answer except what tim and i were telling him  Curiously he has not responded since i sent him the link   Make sure you plan how you'll do things differently when you go back    I did the same thing  Didn't smoke for 4 months while I was away  As soon as I was back I started again  Although I'm not 100  teetotal  I choose to never get drunk  Whilst I like dancing  I have never been to a nightclub and I'm now in my mid twenties  Very occasionally I like to drink a small glass of cider  or have a sip of wine or champaign during celebrations  I always prefer a soft drink   Mum said to me it is okay to drink alcohol in moderation  as this can help you relax  and alcohol consumption is on a fluid scale  Both my family and friends respect me when I choose not to drink   It is my decision to keep my mind clear  hydrated and in full control  The brain uses no more than 20  of your daily energy and I like to treat it as my best friend  The NHS also says regular drinking can cause higher risk of cancer  stroke and organ damage  most notably the brain  heart and lungs    Another reason I stay sober is because I like to set this example as being a good role model  particularly towards young people  Thanks for all your suggestions   will be implementing them  If you've never had a drink you are not an alcoholic   With two parents who are alcoholics you are more at risk of developing a substance abuse problem  but you don't currently have one   And you don't have to develop a drinking problem   Drinking is not a substitute for actually dealing with your feelings   Don't be afraid to have a drink every now and then  if you enjoy it and feel safe drinking   but don't turn to booze as a way to deal with your problems   It will only make things worse   Seek out the help of a therapist  psychologist  or counselor   I also encourage you to look into Al Anon meetings   It is a support group for family members of alcoholics and addicts   It could be really helpful to you   Here is a link to find an Al Anon group near you    http   al anon alateen org  Yay  I made it to 2017  I've got a good feeling about this year and I pledge to start it off on the right foot by not drinking today no matter what  AWSOME  KEEP IT UP   I'm really worried I'll have to get to this point to need to quit   There is a We Agnostics group you can Google Smart Recovery  as well  As a late 30s kind of guy I realize I can be a drunk or sober anywhere  but I do ponder how things might have unfolded differently had I not grown up   attended college here  rekt Fuck the zero  Never going back to that Yeah  I wasn't measuring anything  just abusing the hell outa Kratom  Heaping spoonfuls all day long  however much I wanted  I frequently did enough that I'd get sick  etc  Insanity and embarrassing  As well  I decided to taper and started at 30 g day  which I'm assuming was much less than I was taking  Have been feeling it for sure    Now I'm at 20 grams and I'm gonna stay here for a good while   probably ten days or until I've normalized  Then I'd like to drop a half gram every other day    more when it's easy and less if it's too much  When I tapered off Suboxone  it absolutely felt like it was in layers  I'd like to be off Kratom entirely on 4 1  This is not as easy and I expected it to be  Pretty pissed at myself for getting into this situation at all  but here I am anyway  What bugs me most is fairly constant leg pain  which is what I remember most from getting off Sub   I know it's not good to be judgmental  but your sister's question made me chuckle because I feel like people who drink because "everyone HAS to drink on New Year's" are the real losers   Just sayin         Keep up the good work  So true  I quit for months once and my life was exactly the same as it had been minus the weed  Me  Good for you    That's awesome   Keep it up  Slipped up over the holidays but I'm back and motivated  today I will not drink  merry chrismas ya filthy animal  D Congratulations  that's fantastic    And an organised garage   That's unheard of  I met with a doctor  He told me I had a shitty liver  I said to him it was probably because I drink so much coffee  2 months after that  I got sober  Fully up voted  I wish I knew this before starting kratom  or opioids in general  and when I was first trying to quit  I always threw in the towel at 2 weeks and just last month threw it in at 30 days  I'm approaching my new 30 day abstinence period and addressing the PAWS head on  I can only pray for significant improvements soon  I didn't experience them by day 30 last time  I used for 3 years plus 2 years of opiates before that  I'm starting a step class with my recovery group on Tuesday  Hopefully that will help  Denial  it's not just a river in Egypt   Denial is SO powerful  I was very sure that my problems had nothing to do with booze  Until I quit  Then the fog cleared and I saw exactly what was going on  thanks    I understand that booze may not be the best way to deal with feelings but I just don't know any better way Hey  thanks for sharing and getting that out  You are not alone in this  What helped me a lot when I was feeling hopeless was finding a counsellor I could speak to and get support from  I'd really encourage you to try and do the same  Here are a few resources that can potentially help   https   twloha com find help local resources   Find Help    Crisis Text Line  http   www crisistextline org     text HELLO to 741741  Hang in there  You're probably right  Just stay cautious and don't let loperamide replace your addiction  Good luck  You smoke like me  Here are the withdrawls I get     1st day I get EXCESSIVE sweating around my hands and feet  Like wearing a liquid glove  It is annoying  I am usually unable to sleep  Might I recommend some Benadryl if you must sleep  makes you feel groggy though        2nd day is the same as the first except that I find myself to be incredibly irritable for no particular reason  The slightest thing sets my belly fires going     This state persists in me for about 5 days and then slowly gets better as the weeks go on  I have only had intermittent sobriety and have been back to smoking heavy for a year now  Would like to quit soon but am just   well you know all the reasons we convince ourselves to not do something     I wish I could offer nicer words but the heavy smoking really amplifies the withdrawal effects   I can't believe I used to be a person that said there were ZERO withdrawal symptoms     Of course many of the uncomfortable physical feelings can be temporarily staved off by a cold shower and a shit ton of water  Meditating also helped a lot with the anger     I think it is really excellent that you are starting on this path  The thing is we don't know what we don't have until we get sober  You will definitely get more than 7 reasons after you are sober  Congratulations on 365 days   This internet stranger is proud of you  Cheers to you      We're in this together   Happy New Year  Happy 11 Months  and Congrats on the weight loss   I'm still following your lead     Woohoo   30 Day Sobriety Solution Wow  That thought has blown my mind    I agree  jusr Basic Alchonomics  what are they teaching in school these days    Wonderful thought    Nice Thank you  I'll take a look at it  Smoke free from this morning  me too  Better celebrate making it a day with a long  hard  drag       At least that's what you used to say  Stay on track man you can do it  Thank you for all of these amazing resources    Just like so many others  somehow this subreddit radically changed my thinking about quitting dribkig and provided me with support and stories to keep it that way  I sometimes feel sheepish saying that a subreddit did a better job than AA ever has  but it's working great   I feel like there is accountability here  and shared experience  It's made me stop drinking not only for my amazing spouse   who's given me more unconditional love  forgiveness and support than I feel like I deserve   but also for myself   I don't want to reset my badge  I don't want to go back to the anxiety  depression  the memory loss  the financial strain ever again  That's a common thread amongst so many posts  and they're very important reasons to rid our lives of alcohol   I also will not drink with any of you today  or the rest of this year  Try the al anon meetings   You should be able to find one in your area   You'll find lots of support there   If you are able  I also encourage you to seek out professional help   AA meetings got me started but therapy really helped me to deal with the anxiety that was the root of my drinking   Best of luck to you  Congrats on a YEAR   Happy New Year   Oh my  THANK you  And I love that you say you've only drunk once in 9 months  Such a great outlook on a slip  When I slip  have reset my badge twice now  I'm all "I'm a failure  and I'll probably never get this " This is such a great place to come for encouragement  It seems that most of did the exact same thing  I passes out in front of my family and they were unable to wake me except to take a drink and go back to sleep  I think my longest is about 80 days  That was a few years ago and it took pretty much all of my effort and willpower every day for that entire period to plan my entire life around not picking  It was incredibly strenuous but amazing to see I had it in me   Now  I have a few years of therapy under my belt and I'm handling my anxiety much better  I'm not pick free  but it's also not my main priority to be completely pick free anymore   I pick  very  little compared to what I used to due to a combination of being less anxious  handling it better when I am   understanding my triggers and finding ways to avoid or mitigate them  Yep I have   Another elusive sober Sconnie here  I spent NYE alone because I don't know any sober people  and I don't enjoy spending time with people who are drinking heavily anymore  Congratulations on 99 days sober  Needed that today  Thank you for sharing   Fear Of Missing Out   what if my friends have a great time without me  What if they have the best night ever  What if they meet and hang out with the most interesting person in the world  What if they have the best dance session in their lives   Fear Of Missing Out is ridiculous because we're usually not missing out on anything except for regrets  mistakes and hangovers  at least that's the way I used to drink    Happy New Years  Congrats on 2 years  Well done  I'm 6 days behind you and using patches too  fortunately free on the NHS   This is my third attempt in about 35 years  My worst fear is having a stroke and not being able to talk see move  But yeh  lung cancer's pretty bad too  Well  all the best and I'm sure you'll be a winner for your family and yourself  of course  Fantastic job  I'm grateful you're here     Congrats on a YEAR   Good luck  I was in the same boat  I'm now three weeks in and on the lowest dose patch   When I look at how many years I smoked for and how young I still am it scares me  More than half my life I've been a smoker  Learning how to be a non smoker has been the hardest part but so far it seems to be a much better lifestyle  I wish you the best and look forward to reading your 1 year smoke free post next New Years   Only your doctor can tell you what's really going on  I'm glad you have an appointment  Let us know what you find out  However  after abusing my body for years  it took more than a week to find any kind of equilibrium  Be cautious about self medicating with over the counter  so called  remedies  It's usually a waste of money  The healthiest thing you can do is eat well and don't put alcohol in your body   When I think about not drinking   I inevitably think that I'm doing it to avoid legal  health and relationship complications   Basically  my life is pretty good and there's 0  chance that alcohol is going to  add  to that  but there's certainly a chance that it's going to subtract from that goodness  I'm atheist and Aa is working for me    I'm from Auckland but live abroad at the moment   I hope you have a fantastic time  I've only done the Milford but it was absolutely epic  and when I come back home I want to do the others you listed   Let us know how it goes  So much this  The badge has been a huge reminder of my success in not drinking  and from others experience it seems to help a lot  I will most definitely not drink with you today  You got this   I've been on and off this forum a lot over the past 4 5 months  I made it 45 ish days  and have had a few relapses since  I'm going to spend a lot more time here and make 2017 the start of my new sober life  Thank you to all of the wonderful people here   Chapter one  the beginning to an awesome journey  Good luck  Cool  I'll try that next  Alanon meetings helped me find answers to difficult questions like yours  Meetings are almost everywhere    It's a painful decision to cut ties  but you have a right to peace of mind  Meetings helped me find it   Checking in  still on track   Thank you for that  Yeah  2 weeks isn't exactly correct for most of us  Now I want to say that for those who have had a short habit and moderately small doses  you will have an easier time than those who used for a prolonged period of time  The longer you use the longer it will take to heal  I am at day 31 after a massive habit for a long period of time  I feel great  better than I EVER did on Kratom  shocking  right   but I suspect this "healing process" is going to take a while  I have been at opiates for over 10 yrs  At this point  tbh  I feel better everyday  even better than the day before  You will get out of the quit what you put in  that simple  Good luck everyone  It's doable and you can CHOOSE to only do it once   Very good to know  thank you  I didn't have much luck with finding any AA meetings that were local enough today  but did find Phoenix Multisport  which I've heard great things about  Thanks again for your help  My roommate is trans and she's had similar situations with children pointing her out  I talked to her and she says the best way to manage it is to surround yourself with the people who recognize the positive in you  Also remember that the kid is young and doesn't know any better  You're beautiful with or without a healed face  Steeeerr clear  You don't wanna fuck with GABA        Edit  to elaborate  I really had and have a bad experience with GABA  If you don't currently take it  try not to make a habit of it  But everyone is different  maybe you'll be totally fine  I on the other hand  was not  The memory fucking still continues You have a right to live your life  You sound fine to me  It's nice to have friends who care  but there's a fine line between being concerned and controlling  Don't talk to your friends about it if you don't want their opinion   Exactly the same here  Seeing lots of people here on day 1 too is making me feel better and motivated   I think early sobriety is hard for everyone  I personally was an emotional roller coaster   My spouse drinks heavily and has his own problems with pot and alcohol  like attracts like after all  so it was hard for him a when I quit   especially because I've been trying to quit for years and have mostly failed   For the first while I said I was only quitting for 120 days becuase that's the amount of time I read it takes for your brain to start rewiring   this may not be true but it helped me    He has got used to me not drinking and likes that I am the designated driver   My friends still ask me if I'm not drinking every time we see them too they are taking longer then my husband to adjust  Good luck   Happy New year   January thread is up   https   www reddit com r StopGaming comments 5lhovg joyful january 2017 commit to not gaming this   Day 12  01 01  After being in a flatline since the start of this streak  urges hit me hard  but I have not relapsed  It's the same as always  with curiosities urging me to look for this thing or that thing because I've seen it only a few times before  The part that is the most abnormal about this  isn't the urge  but the fact that real attractive girls that I know personally  suddenly become uninteresting  almost non existent to me compared to the porn flashbacks my mind keeps tempting me with  I'm a woman and an atheist and still found value in AA  The Twin Cities has a multitude of recovery meetings  Generally they are not for any specific age group as you describe  Alcoholism crosses all age  race  gender barriers   I found getting rid of all the alcohol helped me to stick with it  My three or four failed attempts before I left stuff in the house and gave my silly brain justification to go back to drinking    I'm proud of you getting through news years    I had my first for a long time too    I completely disagree brother  It's not just the cardiac issue  Do your research man  I would never take both k and Imodium at the same time  It can very very addictive and it's a wayyyy nastier w d  If you are gonna go the Imodium route  just stop the Kratom and taper smaller doses for 3 days  days 2 3 4 of your CT  You are playing with fire  IMO  You are going to have to pay the piper  one way or another  I would rather do it just coming off kratom  not imodium  that shit can kill you  Be careful man  I will not drink today  I will not drink today     High Five for 365       1    edit  Accuracy is important where those precious 24 hours are concerned  Every day it gets a little better  I'm with you on this one  Btw what creative hobby was it you picked up  I am in a similar place but have not gotten to the point where I am ready to quit  My hope is that the medication will help ease some of the symptoms of my depression before i "leave"  Anything specific get you to making this decision   checking in Me too  I will not drink with you today    I just did  again your perspective is a breath of fresh air  I totally agree with your take on addiction  in my case I still smoke pot and dable in Meth about once a month  I'm not really sure if I am an addict  I've come to question this more recently as my use has limits and boundaries that as I've gotten older I've learned to respect  there have been times  many years  of using hardcore  been through methadone  Suboxone maintenance a few times  withdrawl enough times to realize that I cannot control any opiate opioid use or alcohol  So I abstain from them  Same for benzos  I have a family member who gives me a week at a time  which I usually store up for my monthly Meth binge for the comedown  I smoke pot a few times a week  no one knows this and I'm fine with that   I don't buy into "oh that's the addict talking" I'm not two different people  I'm just someone who has come to the conclusion that I will always use substance s and I will pay the consequences  I'm not hurting anyone and am content with what my life is  one thing that I have learned from my periods of "recovery" is acceptance  anyhow I feel like I'm rambling  it's good to know that there are people like you that are challenging the common misgivings that come with dealing with addiction  I don't know what you mean by "commitment"  AA isn't a club you join  nor is there a contract to sign  It's just a group of people who have a desire to stop drinking  You don't have to talk if you don't wish to share  I've often said  "Thanks  I'd rather listen"    I have no problem with the word "alcoholic" because I learned everything I could about it and know I have this chronic condition  I understand and accept it  Frankly  I am proud to be a recovering alcoholic  I'd much rather have that "identity" than to be labelled a "drunk"    Bravo for having the courage to go to a meeting and kudos for five days  I DID IT I get this feeling sometimes even with 14 months clean  But I force myself to go and always feel so much better after the meeting   It's good to have one less thing to feel guilty about    It's helped me to look at women differently  and to recognise how much commercial porn is pretty rapey and abusive    It's helped me realise that I can be a fantasist about lots of things  enjoying the idea of something but often not having the discipline or courage to make it a reality    It's also helped me realise I can manage very strong desires and emotions  and that I can choose what to do with them  rather than letting them affect me directly  I feel good about myself  that this is a decision I've made  and I've stuck to it  Yeah  I am coming to that belief  too   At least chronic daily drug use anyway   Our bodies  minds and souls just have a preference for     well  sunlight food and water and that's about it   just make sure your setbacks don't turn into excuses to have future setbacks  it's great that you can use this experience  but i know in the past i use to have setbacks all the time and then i'd just use that previous setback as an excuse in the future to hit my friend's joint or to buy a dimebag bc i'd think "it was only one time in the past  i can handle it now"  then you just fall back into addiction but i think you've got strong mind set just from reading your post  good luck with your progress   Congrats on a year  I hope to be where you are at this time next year  Such an accomplishment  I can't imagine all the different emotions you are feeling today  Good luck  Stay strong  Thanks man  likewise best of luck to you in your growth   And I agree  there was a time when Cannabis was probably helping more than hindering  it definitely helped me get through community college at a time where I hadn't really got serious about my future and was just taking classes to keep my parents pacified  but it seems like the returns have diminished to the point where its the other way around   I'm definitely not gonna be one of those ex stoners with a judgy attitude towards others for smoking  because I still have friends that smoke regularly and it does not seem to hinder them in the least   I think smoking in a weird way helped my ADD for a time  even though it slowed the pace I worked at  it helped me stick to tasks for longer   But at this point i'm going to follow the advice of my psychiatrist and begin a regime of an SSRI   Stimulant ADD medication and see how that works for me  I mean  my name is Joysticks so it would only make sense  p I would love to join Thanks for sharing your story with us  and congrats on a year sober  Absolutely  you're so spot on  In many ways I replaced my alcohol addiction with this obsession over another person   You got it  Thanks  You should write tourist pamphlets  Hell yeah  Thank you  2 hours to go and then Just for today you won't have to drink tomorrow either  This is a "We" program  We are not alone  each one of us is the sum of all our experiences  strengths  and hopes  Share more here  online somewhere else  read what everyone posts  respond  reach out to someone else   go to a meeting and share  and pick up that book  My favorite has always been pg 417  4th edition   Acceptance is the answer   God Bless  Your NYE sounds perfect  Not a loser at all  And 100 days tomorrow  That's GREAT   Just because you don't remember it doesn't mean had a bad time   Congratulations    My hope in life is that someone actually acts rude to my face  I'm all peaches and cream  but step on my toes and the Eastern European in me comes out  It's cute watching people's faces drop as they fear for their lives   Great job  Running helped me out a lot too   I'm starting running tomorrow again   Laying in bed now happy that I survived day 1   1 1 17  Checking in  clean   Get ready for some vivid dreaming   Ten years I smoked daily  and I am now on day 86 without and am back to normal sleep  but the dreams at the beginning of my sobriety were insane   Not necessarily bad dreams  though some were  but they were all so vivid and real I often didn't want to go back to sleep   I spend some of those nights reading about what they call "REM rebound"  and how long it takes to recover   It took me about 4 weeks before I got back to normal sleep with normal dreams  Lol at sugar sweaters    Congrats to you    A therapist was helpful to me  I went to meetings but a therapist gave me a professional to talk with and it was private  I learned a lot about myself and started taking better care of myself   Don't get me wrong I was destroyed with guilt afterwards and was really down that I had drank after seven months sober  but then I thought it's still seven months sober  the one slip doesn't mean I have to erase the seven months  That chain of thought is what makes a slip turn into a relapse and people get discouraged with there efforts  Instead of that I remind my self I still did seven months  and when I get to a year I will add an extra day to it and then I will say I've not drank for a year   knowing I had my slip but it still will be 365 days of not drinking none the less  Just with a one day gap in there to make the period 366  We'll actually 367 it's a leap year   this reset policy I think is taken too seriously  it should be only applied if one turns back to there old ways and starts binge drinking uncontrollably over a several days without being able to stop themselves  Not just for a single slip up  I find that's too much emotional dissatisfaction to add to an already challenging mission   maybe if you slip up week after week after week then yeah you should reset as it's obviously not working    Beautiful  Thank you My thoughts  after watching this unfold for several years with tons of people  matches your consensus   Both with the opioid  SNRI and SSRI tendencies and how those underlying connections create a very unique WD profile   There isn't anything like kratom withdrawals      it's a very bizarre constellation of symptoms and it seems as if each person gets a tailor made cluster of them     For instance  I never had insomnia or RLS   Not in any quit attempts    but it seems I had a deeper typer of fatigue than most   Very strange plant   Cool reminder why quit and continue not smoking  Thanks  I have 3 years 9 months sober   I went from my family pretty much hating me never wanting me around always talking down to me ect   Now I'm welcomed and loved by them That is what makes recovery awesome All the bs and hard work you do along the way starts paying off   I'm glad that you are able to somewhat shrug it off This might not be the last time horrible things are said to you Be strong  Happy New Year  I would agree with SOmuch2learn  completely  We all do tend to want to fix each other  Sometimes to forget to just lend an ear  Have a great year  enjoy your new place  I like your thinking   it's very positive  I think I fail at things because I'm so legalistic and tell myself 'If it's not perfect then it doesn't count ' And of course that causes me to give up  I just reset my badge a week ago because I had a beer   which I didn't even enjoy   and felt discouraged that I lost something like 78 days  Ah well  It was a learning experience anyway  Thanks for your encouragement  and cheers from rainy Southern California  Happy New Year    Well done  Keep up the great work  Children are pretty well known for saying what's on their mind  Young children don't even have the mental capacity to understand that being frank can be hurtful  It sucks to hear what they've got to say sometimes  but you can't get too phased by what children say  Their understanding of pretty ugly is primitive and discriminatory by nature  They know something as the norm  like what a doll or a TV show character looks like  and things outside that norm are weird to them  It  has nothing to do with your quality as a human being  Don't derive your self worth from a child's opinion    I say this as someone who has worked with children for many years  I've heard all kinds of things being said about me  They learn tact over time  Congrats to you   Sober life IS really worth it Things in life you didn't care so much about becomes the most important thing to you Such as your family  This   You got this  I will not drink with you today     Hey there  We're in the same exact boat  so I have no wise words  other than to reassure u that you're not alone   I think there's lots of us  I wish like hell I could afford have the time and space to just check myself into detox for a couple weeks and get this done  But even if I did that  I'd come out dragging butt  cuz the whole ordeal won't be over in 2 weeks anyway    I'm tapering too  There's absolutely zero instant gratification whatsoever in tapering either  It's slow  frustrating  and kinda tortuous  I'm so achy like u  so unmotivated  and the mornings totally suck  However  like u said  even tho you've tapered slowly  it's something  It IS something  It means u recognized it's a problem  u stopped making it worse  and you've turned in the other direction  That's what I tell myself  I was taking more and more and more Kratom  Totally out of control  If I take a teeny bit less  I WILL eventually be taking nothing  So will u  Hang in there   Happy new year  Congrats on the progress and the little one  Keep us updated  please  So what's your plan   In my experience  it's not enough to not be planning to use   I needed an active plan to keep from using   What  will you change to keep from getting in a using situation  If I am not mistaken  that quote can be attributed to Tony Robbins  I am reading his book "Awaken the Giant Within" right now  and I just watched the film about him on Netflix "I am not you fucking guru"  He is a strange and wonderful person  On my first days I did a lot of sd reading and posting   It kept me occupied and somewhat sane  It worked for me  Do you have a running plan that you will follow  I will not drink with you today   Sign me up Inspirational  well done      Weed flattens your highs and lows  thus you not really have to deal with that kind of stuff  These lows normally forces people to learn how to deal with these moments  Now that you stopped you arrived at your first low in a long time  I think what you do next is vital   This is it  100    I always say that the danger of weed isn't that it can kill you or destroy your insides  but that it creates such a strong barrier between you and reality  It makes you ok with doing nothing and going nowhere  It is soooo soothing  Under normal circumstances  negative emotions and hardships are a SIGN  A signal that   hey  something needs to change here  Something isn't right  When you're being soothed by weed 24 7  those red flags and signals become this distant whisper that we don't even hardly hear anymore    Embrace this change   brunior  Your headlights are coming back on  You can see red flags for what they are now  and rather than ignore  you can make the necessary modifications to your life   Haha great to have you  I guess i have to  too  Struggling with addiction is not something I thought I would ever have to do   Being bulimic is never understood by anyone but another bulimic  When I read this I felt every word and maybe for the first time someone feels how I feel  Nice job on this  Words are so powerful   I stopped drinking when the pain of continuing to drink outweighed the pain of quitting  While I can think of alternative additional responses  none are as correct or complete  Sign me up please    That's my go to response as well   tomorrow night is my quit smoking day  and also my quit drinking to excess night  2017 gonna suck  Yes and no  That's where I got it but I looked for the source and it may be attributed to Bill Gates in a very different context  Went to the gym from 11pm 1am so I didn't have to dwell on my sobriety while everyone else was getting fucked up   Felt good  got a great workout in  18 days here  I wish you were there  that'd have been hilarious  I shy up too easily and avoid confrontation  that 1000 yard staredown and i think you got a pretty decent boob game to play with  obvillusally i have no idea where i was going with this so happy new barf year  I am saddened to hear about your brother  but so glad you decided to reach out for help  From one brother of a problem drinker to another  I know how hard it is to watch someone harm themselves and others with the bottle  I also know what it is like to live with the remorse of my own harms done through drinking    About 4 years after I got sober  my brother began to abuse alcohol and I felt I could no longer be in his presence but for a limited amount of time  At first  every bone in my body told me to baby sit him to make sure he didn't hurt himself  After some time  and the help of others who had been there before  I realized that there is nothing I can do to keep him from drinking unless he wants the help for himself  And by trying to lessen his consequences  I could be enabling him to continue his behavior    I have tried to assist my brother in bettering himself and his situation numerous times  I've lectured him and admonished him   probably don't need to expand on the consequences of those decisions  The most effective communications that I've had with him were always when I focused on myself  avoid 'you' language  when speaking about his behavior  Be straightforward but respectful in your tone while telling him how you felt when he did x  y  or z  You can do that without saying anything about his drinking explicitly    Most importantly  I always ask myself what my motive is when communicating with someone who has just hurt me  Am I trying to get them to change by controlling his behavior  or do I want to let them know how they effected me for the sake of my own integrity and that of our relationship    I learned most of this stuff through the help of members of various 12 step groups  AA  Al Anon  ACA   If you want to learn more there is plenty of information in the form of literature and meetings of those fellowships  If you'd like some recommendations in that area please don't hesitate to contact me    Take care of yourself and remember that despite his struggles with booze  your brother does love you and is capable of change  You sound to me like a caring and supportive brother  He is fortunate to have someone in his life who wants to do what he can to understand his situation   can i sign up for this now  I havent posted here in a few days and missed the roll call  Awesome post   Congratulations   Started 11pm on 31st  Smashed my bong  cast away my remaining mix and told my mates  I spent yesterday  1st Jan  exercising and keeping my mind distracted  Feels good to be on the path  albeit for some 36 hours   Ive got my Quit Cannabis app keeping a live score in time saved   money saved and how my body is slowly regenerating and renewing  15 year daily here and I can't wait to reclaim my sobriety  Here with you and our fellow leavers here   Fistbump  Checking in  Glad you're here    Thank you  I'm with you    The most interesting  albeit understandable  trend I'm finding in the thread is the more embarrassing stories are just now being added  I'm so excited that I did not spend New Years Day hungover in bed      Oh wow    it sounds like I wrote this post  Today is my 6th day without a drink and I'm hoping it sticks this time too  We can do this we can all sponsor and support each other  I think I will definitely be using some of those tips from the other posts  You got this    I really wish I'd not lurked for years  It's really nice to feel supported and able to be honest about my problem  Glad you came back  Now I'm thinking about how delicious that fresh mint would taste in my herbal tea   Hi glad you're here and seeking help  Can you get to an urgent care or doctor  At that level of drinking you may not want to quit cold turkey it could kill you  Once you get sober that paranoia will subside  alcohol causes that   Great   Since I have  zero  reasons to drink  I have  infinite  reasons to Live Sober         So I got  that  going for me  which is nice  https   www youtube com watch v pBWcRqPesws    Thank you so much for this     I was very similar  I needed serious help  It started with a trip to my doctor  I like your perspective on keeping a positive attitude towards weed  It creates cognitive dissonance to quit something I continue to respect  but it's the hard path that creates the strongest growth  I'm in no place to decide what type of medications are appropriate for you  but I would like to share that I was diagnosed with ADHD in high school and got put on adderal  It seemed like the golden answer  I could work on anything endlessly  and had more focus and drive than ever before  It took about 3 years to catch up with me fully and bomb my whole life  It started with no appetite  then no sleep  then another medication to calm me down  and then an antidepressant because I was growing deeply depressed  Not only had I lost food and sleep to the prescribed stimulant  but I lost my friends as well  Turns out people didn't like being around someone on speed  Too much talking  lack of emotion  and zombie like characteristics arising from my inability to eat or sleep  In the end  I was on adderall for ADHD  xanax to calm down from the anxiety caused by adderall  an antidepressant to "even things out" and then     and this is the best part    my doctor decided that he wanted to add Lithium into the regimen since I was "up and down"  adderall and xanax will do that  and I was in such a jacked up mindset  I agreed  It wasn't long until I was seeing shadow people at night and having night terrors  I quit taking all medications in a personal crisis on news years eve 2008  and my life immediately turned around  I know this is an extreme example  and I was a younger and naive boy with less experience  but I almost ended up a crazy person from taking medications as prescribed by a psychiatrist  And to add to the confusion  the doctor was one of the "top in his field" and had attended something like 18 years of higher education  Whew sorry for the slight negative angle and long response  I  just can't remain silent on my experience with western meds  Best of luck in whatever works best for you  though  I know everyone's different and it might be what you need Thank you     I would like opinions on a recent claim made by a member of the SROL admin team   The claim is that the chat meeting program currently in use at SROL is a product of their own development   Here is the posting   Question  I was in a mtg and had to exit because my screen was freezing  I was given the password at the start of the mtg and when I tried to get into the mtg with the password  it gave me the error AC1727  This is not the first time this has happened to me    BTW Chris  great chat program  Wow  That's a lot of programming to bring it to completion  I heard you did the chat program yourself  Kudos dude   Response  Thank you for the compliment  The chat system was a team effort  you can read more about that here   link deleted  We will soon be releasing an update to mitigate that error  but for the moment  the best thing to do when you see that error is just to try again  Chris SMART Recovery Online  SROL  Admin  Now  considering that BigBlueButton is a OpenSource program  freely available to anyone  is it proper to make it appear it is a product developed by SROL   Discussion welcomed  Thanks I'm on the cover  fam   Well  I wasn't "shocked"  and I wasn't  denying  the problem      I was  refusing to address  it  You are here  asking for help  because you know that excuses are just BS  I am proud of you  brother  The weed in insideous  Read through the posts that others here have made  You will see that we all struggle with excuses  BUT the good news is  you are much stronger than the excuses  The path starts so hard  but every day  you get better at telling those excuses to Get the fuck out of your head   You are strong  You are brave  You can do it  We are there for you  Day 2 is just around the corner  Then day 3  4 and so on  You have friends here   I guess you find the most persistent long term withdrawal fighters among people who quitting antidepressants  I had read a few stories at http   survivingantidepressants org  It was not about the improvements after 1 2 or 3 weeks  it was about the improvements after 1 2 or 3 years    Woo Hoo   Great    You in the fold or not   Mango  go easy on him  I mean I wouldn't  but whatever   Sugar is water soluble you faking cunt    I told everyone an easy solubility experiment    You and  u timbf are fucking fakes    Literally anyone can test this and see you're wrong    For those reading this  dump sugar into a spoonful of water    See how the water soluble sugar doesn't dissolve     Now add heat  it dissolves    EVERY JUNKIE KNOWS THIS    These fucking fakes act like that isn't a thing    Fuck them    They're lying cunts  How were your dreams before quitting  Were they not nightmares or do you think you can just recall them better now  High five on 1100 days  Mr Carr made my quit easy this time too  I hope to hear about your experience   As u SOmuch2learn shares  the only requirement to be there is a desire to stop drinking   You won't be forced to do anything   I hope everything exceeds your expectations in a positive manner  I believe I'm doing this for the right reasons  I find myself wanting to have a better relationship with my wife  It even helps our sex life  Before I wasn't nearly as motivated to have sex because I was able to find an outlet elsewhere  As far as I'm concerned with my wife  she has been to hell and back with me on this  Unfortunately  I think I take advantage of her patients and forgiveness which has led to too many relapses  Quite frankly I'm surprised she has put up with me this much  I get the physical and psychological aspects of this but I think I'm too easy on myself  I don't think the community has been hard enough on me  I'm sick of not taking this seriously enough  I'm just not sure how to follow through  and I'm a little scared too I meant I don't have to worry about cardiac issues  Haha lighten up man  Why so angry  Embarassed by the truth  You have been Proven wrong admit it  Be a man for once instead of hiding behind your bottle  Its a good feeling giving something back  i got to give a lift to a friend on xmas day as his dad fell seriously ill  I supported him in his time of need and i wouldnt have been able to if I hadn't stopped    For the next couple of weeks   r cripplingalcoholism is participating in our yearly population survey   Please take a few moments to answer some questions and tell us a

information  Cheers     I am a bot  and this action was performed automatically  Please  contact the moderators of this subreddit   message compose  to  r cripplingalcoholism  if you have any questions or concerns   No rls or insomnia   Wow you might be the first  Rls seems to be the notorious hallmark of kratom withdrawal  Either way  most of us can agree that it sucks in some form or another haha I was pretty much in the same situation  I've been struggling with a breakup for the last month and of course that night I dreamt about her again so right off the bat waking up I was feeling a little down  I went for a drive in the morning and then a walk through the woods to ease my mind  Met up with my buddy and told him I think I'm going to have some beer that night  I could tell he was hesitant in agreeing with my decision but I said I've thought it through and I want to give it a try after being sober for a while  I knew I was sad and drinking is never the answer  but I went with it anyways   Grabbed my signature drink  12 pack of 6  and cracked the first one around 4pm  Took my long whiff before I had a sip as I've always done  Struggled to get through 3 before our ride showed up 3 5 hours later  At the party I started drinking a little faster to try and mimick how I used to do things  Started a "deep" conversation with someone about humans and our perception of senses and I noticed when people are drinking it's more of a one way convo  Neither party really wants to listen but rather only say their opinions  I could tell he was getting frustrated so I removed myself from the situation  I noticed how people were talking about their problems and saying how they needed alcohol in their life to subdue their emotions  I also noticed how fake a lot of these emotions were while intoxicated  Laughing harder to fit in  etc   It wasn't the same as before  I didn't enjoy the alcohol  In all honesty  I mostly wanted to go to try and get laid so I could take my mind off things but that wasn't happening  I still love her too much  I had my vape  a Christmas present  stolen from me so I decided to go home and call it a night  Instead of walking I jogged for the 45 minute trip before finally hitting the bed   I awoke this morning with not so much shame as before  Bittersweet really  She decided to message me at 4am telling me about her evening over at her sisters  So today I was right where I was yesterday stuck thinking of her  This time I didn't go to the booze  I had started drawing then broke down and talked to my mother instead  I no longer want alcohol  It just doesn't suit me anymore and I don't enjoy the numbness  I feel much better after crying and dealing with my emotions head on compared to how I did when I drank to numb them out   I think I've finally reached the point I'm ready to let go  I just don't enjoy drinking anymore  It's a relief  and I always thought if I gave it another go  especially with the state I'm in I'd cave and hit another binge but no  not anymore  So this is a new year but more importantly  a new day  Knowing that I have zero temptation to drink anymore is probably the best feeling I can have   I read the book How to Control Drinking by Allen Carr and in the last chapter he asks to have one final drink and be aware of that drink as you consume it  I didn't do that step so I treated last night like that  Safe to say I understand everything now and am ready to finally stop with the relapses and close this chapter  Thank you to everyone here at SD  This will probably be my last post for a long time as I feel I've used the resources given to me and now I can make room for someone else  Here's to sobriety  and here's to a better future for all of us  I hope everyone else can reach this point as well  we are all capable of beating alcohol  Don't stress over relapsing  just keep trying and it will come   Also  sorry about jumping in your thread like this  I started writing and got a little side tracked  Yes it is stressful  like different parts of the brain are fighting  I keep reminding the impulsive part of my brain of the emptiness in porn  that its an empty promise  Sugar and heroin are two different substances  They have different structures and thus dissolve differently  I made a thread for you  You are wrong  Unless every person on r o is also wrong and we're not    We are done here  Thank you for this  the symbolism here is powerful  Statements like these are a great reminder that I'm supposed to feel the things I've been experiencing   Today and the last couple of days have been pretty tough  but I'm pulling through  Haha  Happy New Year to you too     Proven wrong    You must be high    Anyone can verify what I'm saying  Great Resource Guide  Thank you for posting this  I'm around your age and I was just thinking that "am I too young " a few minutes ago  Reading your thoughts is helpful thank you   You can totally do this  We all can  You inspired me to make a post about this very thing lol    Best of luck   Why are you here  Happy New Year  Uncle S   I can't have alcohol in the house  I'm too impulsive  Kudos to you  I really do try to be polite  but when it comes down to it do not cross me   Very cool  congrats   Awww   Love this PG  How appropriate      I agree with the previous responses  You may need a detox  Sounds serious to me  You can stop  Sober in Saint Paul here  I've found the zen meetings to be really helpful  and with almost no mention of AA literature and religion  usually   Common Ground Meditation Center  The Zen Center  and Clouds and Water all have meetings     I lost track of how many steps backwards in the last year   Some of them were right over a cliff   I'm not sure how I would have done if I had been anywhere near alcohol in the last week or so   I've yet to be truly tested  I'm hoping that when the time comes  I won't forget what bits I've learned along the way so far   I'd like nothing more than to see you back on track   I've learned a lot from you already  I look forward to learning more in the coming sober days   especially today   Good luck to you my friend   I'll see you at "2" tomorrow  My Groundhog wishes you and your Mom  Happy Sober New Year  Wow I'm surprised you were able to let that slide  good on ya for having a tougher skin  If someone said that to me I'd be right pissed off  Although that's just because I have a tendency to overreact in general  even when sober  So take pride in that you did what I probably would not  Either way what counts is that we're sober  Sign me up  lets do this  Are you me      Thanks for the reply  Thank you so much  I'll be here   Thanks so much  the encouragement means a lot      Looking forward to that moment myself  Well done  I can't talk in your thread  you guys muted me in a place I have never been    And yes  they're two different substances  but how solubility works doesn't magically change  regardless of the substance    You two fakers need to piss off  then we'll be done  I agree with the other posts  It might be a good idea to see a Dr or go to the ER Right   It's going to be a sweet space  I'm super excited   Its late in the uk so not drinking with you tonight and I will spot you for tomorrow   Great job not dirnking  And that's a lot of drinking normalization intertwined into GT culture  No wonder we internalize this stuff   I just realized I won't get to watch PSU in the Rose Bowl unless we go out to a bar or find a friend who will be watching it  we don't have cable   Oh well   Congrats on the GT win  btw  I remember that you started with Kratom and Wellbutrin almost at the same time   It takes some weeks for Wellbutrin to work properly  and that could maybe the case now    I'll not drink today  Stay strong   I'm on day 1 too  I was very close to smoking a bowl but I reminded myself why I am doing this  I also just keep telling myself just get through today    we can worry about tomorrow tomorrow   Great  I hope your liver has reacted well    Do you have plans to reflect on your feelings as you go through this month sober  That might be the most telling  I'm not much of a journal keeper  but I do find it to be helpful to write about this part of my life  as you say above  it helps to lay it all out    I hadn't thought about it  but that's a nice idea  thanks   I'm not much of a journal keeper either  but I try it now and then   You're right that it could be a useful tool in reflecting and making decisions moving forward  Great job on one year    Those things taste like cough syrup but you cant beat the  14 abv  You got to party and you feel good the next day  great stuff  These all sound like good reasons not to drink  thanks for sharing  I'll not drink with you today  i've been trying to work on it for about 6 years  but i have no desire to work on it at this point  typically in the past i'd restrict  more lately i've been binging and purging and restricting  it's very frustrating  i just want to go back to my restricting tendencies Me  Mom and our Groundhog wish you and your family a Happy  Healthy  Peaceful and Sober New Year  I'm trying very hard to help her with my NY resolution hope for her  Please  for heaven's sake  stop hiding and throwing away her med's   The tech actually had to shut down her machine at dialysis on Saturday AM because she got sick  BUT   I'm sober  so there's that      Checking in  Good look to everyone and happy new year  Checking in  Good look to everyone and happy new year  You can comment on the sub  Just not in modmail anymore   Man I love your posts https   www reddit com r opiates comments 5lhchd heroin argument please settle this for me  No gaming on my phone  I don't own a console or PC  I'm committing to a 90 day detox    I'm doing this because videogames take up far too much time and they're bad for me mentally and physically  That would definitely help me to have a SO that did not drink   My husband is looking forward to having drinks   I am feeling strong though   I think having a plan is the key   We CAN do this   My self identified worst quality is the tendency to overreact  so I was especially proud of myself when I didn't go off the deep end  Sobriety has forced me to get it in check and it's definitely been useful when put in situations like the one today I think the fact that you are questioning your drinking habits indicates that you already realise that it is a problem  The fact that you made the decision to do something dangerous to yourself and other people like drunk driving  a decision you wouldn't couldn't make sober  indicates that your drinking causes you to do things that are problematic to you  Read ' this naked mind ' which can be found for free on the sidebar   The first weeks were really tough for me  things did get better  Great job on another day  Thank you    So nice to hear a success story for this scenario   I CAN do it        Congratulations on a year Planned

you all  For once on New Years I didn't feel like throwing up during breakfast   Good call for the cost benefit chart    I'll consider that homework     As you adjusted  did you find a lot of your friends and typical social activities were no longer a good fit   That worries me were I to quit in the long term  There is a ton of great advise on this sub  One of the things that I have seen repeatedly here is "if you are on this site asking if you have an alcohol problem  most likely you do"  Not everyone who has an alcohol problem looks or acts like the stereotypical "drunk" that you have an image of in your head  To put it simply drinking the way I did was a problem for me  therefore I had an alcohol problem  I didn't have to hit rock bottom to know that I had to change my relationship with alcohol  I can't stop at 1 or 2  therefore I can't allow myself to start again  I hope this ramble helps  Cheers to not drinking together today  Congratulations on making it so far   That's OK man  I'm still going to not PMO no matter what  I'm resolved to get better at looking out for triggers  I knew I was not in a good state of mind  and I should not have brought my computer into my room   I sincerely wish that you have the strength to continue to fight and improve yourself  This minor setback will be only a small bump on the road to becoming a better individual   Happy new year to you  I'm starting to realize sobriety is a process  I reset my badge many times but I keep trying  Everytime I fell off the wagon just added to the mountain of evidence that drinking is not good for me  Seems like everytime I fell off the wagon  my drinking was more out of control  It made my resolve stronger as I did not want to see where I ended up if I continued drinking  Please don't beat yourself up and above all  DON'T GIVE UP   I am going through a difficult time emotionally  but when I drink I get even more sad  depressed and emotional  Good luck in your recovery  Instagram is the  1 trigger for me too  Me too  Snowshoeing in the mountains  Everyone on the path was cheery and it was the place to be  Starting the new year out right  cant be much worse then the last one  fuck i jinxed it  You also just said you dont want to ever die  so why dont you try picking one  perhaps the better option   I remember feeling like I had this new super power early in sobriety  No matter what time of day or night it was  I could operate a car safely  Almost done with the first day hahaha I'm in on this  Hi There   Been there done that   I was a fifth a day drinker   When I was awake I was drinking   I felt really guilty about it but I couldn't stop   I was drinking to cover up unpleasant feelings in my head   My problem was starting to weigh on my job  my family  and me   I was involuntarily yanked out of my very good job and went to treatment for three motnhs   My last drink was in February 2016   I feel so much better now but I still have a long way to go   The one thing that helps me the most to stay sober is to seek out and hang out with other people like me   Their story is my story   I get it   The more I do the better I feel and I've really had no obsession to drink since   I wish you the best  Like I said before  I can't participate in your thread cause you fucks muted me    They do dissolve differently  but it's not  completely dissimilar    We'll be done here when you two fake motherfuckers who pre ban people piss off    Cunts open a thread  ban me  then act like I won't participate    That's shady as fuck   Luck is great  and I believe in both of you  I believe you have it in you to overcome your battles and be the 2017 champions  I appreciate women's AA meetings  I also attend agnostic meetings  Good luck  If you get that crystal ball   mind sharing it with me   I drove myself crazy most of 2016 wanting to know what the universe had in store for me   I wanted answers  and I wanted them then an there   Hah   The universe laughed at me and said  "The one question you must answer is simple  will you drink today    Answer that properly and all will be revealed in good time "  I know what I wanted to tell the universe it could do with its so called good time  but I decided it best not to piss off the universe   Hang in there TSrW   we can all do this thing if we never stop trying   I will try my best today with you  Oh hell man  that sounds really rough  I can understand your problem with alcohol  when I'm drunk  I'm not a nice person  I've done so many stupid things under the influence that just  aren't  things I would do if I were sober   I hope everything works out and you're back home soon  I hope you'll check in again  and you and me can not drink together  I went to the ER one year ago today   I was drinking about 20 drinks a day  from morning to night   They gave me a bag of fluids  monitored my blood pressure and sent me home with some meds   I followed up with my family doctor 2 days later   Good luck to you  We banned you from modmail  not from the sub  Try to comment on the sub  If you cant i will unmute you  But the thread was up for at least 45 minutes after i sent you the link and before i muted you  Yeah I've heard it taking longer for some people  Either way  it does get better eventually  I must be one of the lucky people because I was about 80 90  better by the end of week 2 and back to baseline by 3 3 5 weeks  This was cold turkey attempt after a little less than 2 years daily up to 30 40g daily  Was clean for awhile then relapsed for a few months  This time I'm tapering and its been a lot easier  Almost unnoticeable some days  Mostly just a mental game  Kratom is a funky drug and the severity varies widely for people and for different experiences  My first time I was waking up every morning with sweats and rls  This time  I rarely encounter that  but deal more with cravings and lack of motivation  I'd say on average it takes anywhere for 2 weeks to 8 weeks to feel back to baseline  Some shorter  some longer Hey  friend  I ended up in the ICU after a terrible drinking binge   It was the best thing that could have happened to me   I think that seeking medical advice is the best way to go   It gave me the strength to make it back to sobriety   I'm in the US    I actually was using the medical cost as an excuse as to why I didn't want to go to the doctor   and then I ended up taking the ride by ambulance   You deserve all of the wonderful things that sobriety offers  so I hope that you decide to seek some medical supervision to take the steps that you'll need to take when ready   Best wishes of good health   happiness to you  I hope you are able to quit  the feeling of not knowing what happened the night before is the worst thing about drinking for me  it seems like it is always something terrible  I wish I didn't wait another 30 years beyond your age before I finally realized what drinking was doing to me   If I had found the wisdom and courage to face this thing early on  I think   no  I know   that I would have been far better off for it   You have the opportunity to turn this thing around at a relatively young age   I wish I had seen and taken that opportunity   As others have said here  it's best to seek out all the medical help and emotional support you can   This is a good place for the latter  366 tho I will not drink with you today  Glad you are here     Thank you this does help   Thanks u guys  I really love recovery and all the people in it  Made first meeting tonight and I really really feel great  Thanks God I got out of the house  Thanks again and Happy New Year   Thx  I will not drink or smoke today  Keeping my short streak live  Done with that stuff  I had a great sober time in 2016  Moving forward in 2017  I am about to go through the same thing myself  Been smoking everyday for the last 2 and a half years  Hardest thing for me I know is going to be able to get decent sleep  I have been dependent on weed to fall asleep for so long that I know I'll just lay there wide awake without smoking  Appetite will be affected as well  And I get mood swings and night sweats when I quit after heavy use  Not going to be fun  I have quit several times before but I always seem to come back  Good luck to you my friend   good luck to PSU   know a lot of alums from there   great to see y'all relevant again    hopefully  the worst of it behind you    I would avoid it like the plague for the rest of your life man  it is truly not worth you "testing" the waters  You have no idea what is in store with you if you carry the gene  Alcohol ruined my 20's and nearly my life  My biological father is an alcoholic whom I do not know  My biological mother was a drug addict and did time  I cannot stress how much you should not take a drink  But this life you have is your journey so it is ultimately up to you   Well said   Thanks   YVW     You're nearly 2 weeks in   One year from now that will mean your badge is nearly 400   Stick with this   you can do it    Good luck man  I'm 63 days without PMO and found that easier to kick than my cigarette habit  Lem's gonna Lem You can totally do this  "You deserve all of the wonderful things that sobriety offers  "  Amazingly put  Thank you for your thoughts    OP  you're never too far gone  We're all here with you  and we won't drink with you today   Double amen to that P G  This is by no means my first go at quitting  but I will suggest getting yourself the fizzy drinks of your choice to replace that need for glass in hand  I like tonic with lime   some sweets  and a new thing to keep you occupied  Oh and stick around this sub  I won't drink with ya  Feelings on individual spirituality aside   Wayne Dyer has interesting thoughts on this  which my spouse eloquently rephrased  "you have to go to a specific store  in Colorado anyway   you have to take out your wallet and show your ID to someone with the exclusive intent to buy something you're telling me you didn't intend to buy   isn't it easier to just  not do that in the first place "  Well  yeah  but when I was drinking  any and all logic flew out the window when I was buying what was killing me and I feel that might be the case for others  When that animal is gnawing at you  it's hard to be present    But that's why this amazing place exists  and we're all here for each other  Congratulations    Thank you     I definitely identified with your post  Glad you're here  and I will not drink with you today  You're pretty wise  PG   checking in  Hi mermaidbadbich    This sub is really supportive and is full of useful information x I too have trauma from earlier on in my life  I'm currently seeing a therapist and trying to work my way through it  I think drinking for me can be a way of self medicating    I remember hearing those words a while back "self medicating" and thinking  pfft    I'm just trying to have a good time   that's not me    The more I deal with things that trigger me and confront and work through why I am the way I am  the more chance I have to heal and lead a happy healthy life  Therapy may not be for everyone  but it's a suggestion  I don't want to be a slave to the past either  It's awesome you have a supportive boyfriend x  Sometime just posting on here and getting it all out helps me a lot too  also reading other peoples stories  It helps keep me strong  I hope to see you around here    Good  No big cravings yet  It's largely been a matter of "hmmn i ought to have a ciggarrette   OH WAIT I DON'T DO THAT ANYMORE" I'm anxious for future days but I reckon I can get through it  I always somehow thought that going cold turkey would be too stressful that it's not worth it   but every time I've tried to convince myself that i can just cut down I've failed  This is working for me  because I've always struggled with "never" but then again you have to recognize that an addiction is an addiction and its not like I enjoy cigarettes anyway  I can't tell you how many times I slipped up on Day 4  What is that about  Congrats and keep it up  I won't drink with you today  For the next couple of weeks   r

HALF WIT  I CAN'T COMMENT ON YOUR SUB  FUCKING HALF WIT  I hope you go  relax  and enjoy the coffee and the comfort of being around like minded people      "How would i become the chatty  funny  easy going girl everyone likes to be around " I would describe drinking as having done the exact same thing for me  and when I first started it was hugely appealing  I thought I was becoming the real me  But the amount of socializing and how I acted in social situations was out of sync with my true nature and really  my soul  This dissonance started to create more stress as time went on  Relationships take energy and as my alcohol use continued  friendships started to fall apart as poorly as the foundation they were built on  I was spending a lot of time with people I wasn't even sure I liked  and some of them I actively didn't really like  but I thought having friends was more important than that  I swapped quality for quantity and even my true  loving friendships were built on a foundation of alcohol misuse    Eventually my problem with drinking got extreme enough that I was willing to give up any social benefits  there were basically none left at this point anyway   even worse  it had all fallen apart and gotten worse than I ever could have imagined   I was willing to give up the escape and social lubrication  I decided I would rather find out who I really was  even if that's a sensitive  socially anxious sort of introvert   I knew I had to quit because every single other thing I tried to fix my problems was like putting a bandaid on a gushing pipe  But quitting drinking was like hiring a pipe fitter to fix the pipe  My gut told me there was a serious problem when I drank and that quitting was the way out of my insanity and misery  Wow  our timelines match perfectly  I'm with you on that  I've never tried an anti depressant  but that quick fix sounds nice at times  However  I agree completely about not trusting it or the docs prescribing it  I've also heard they have to test a bunch sometimes to see what will even work  so I assume by that point I'll be out of it on my own  Not worth it    I have been exercising regularly since quitting and that helps immensely  Only problem is  the feeling is short lived  The depression comes in waves now which is better  but the last wave lasted much longer which worried me  My diet was shit  so I've actually just started to try eating cleaner  Hopefully that will help  So far I'm just making a kale shake with protein and fruit in the morning  I need to do more  but it's a start    Thanks for the advice  I'm gonna work on my diet now  Good luck to you as well  and happy new year   Skin heals  as  u MyMuddyEyes said  but a heightened sense of empathy and the ability to see past others' physical imperfections are two things that can be earned while living with CSP   I don't flinch when I see defects  surgery scars  burns  birth marks  I know there's a person standing in front of me who is very aware of their imperfections  as I am of mine    I know what it is to be ugly    I also want and deserve my dignity  as do they    That kid will likely never attain that level of understanding about the people in their life  or be able to use it to their advantage in relationships  But you have  and you can  That's awesome   I find that when I get to help someone else out  I get just as much out of it as they do  Wait      You play billiards  Like the classic version  I thought I was the last one  Hah    ew    I'm as unfeminist as they come but fuck off with that bullshit  Maybe you need to figure out why you're angry  You can totally do it man    Don't waste any more of your time on a shit game   Be careful with the demon that is suboxone It sounds like you are forming a pretty solid plan   I think that putting the word out to people in your circle is key    you've done that already   I know that distraction is my best friend when it comes to staying sober   If I get in a funky mood and start to think of drinking  I'll stop whatever I am doing in the moment and move on to something enjoyable for a bit  reading a chapter in a book I like  browsing the internet  or talking to a friend on the phone for a bit    I hope this helps    I will not drink with you today if that helps  too     Try to find s nee hobby  Also just streaming anything or video games that you can crawl through help a ton for the first few months  I was smoking to numb the pain      My boyfriend was cheating on me and ignored me  It made me feel unattractive and unloved  I'm a Leo and I thrive on that       Once I left him I kept smoking because I was so lonely  I would smoke all the time because I didn't want to be alone  I still struggle with this but everyday gets easier    I've tried quitting over and over in the last two months  This is my longest stretch at 10 days and when I did smoke it was social puff puff     I work really hard to be social and create true friendships but that takes a lot of time  The friends that did stick by me    help me every step of the way   I'll unmute you but if you continue with the insults there I'm just going to do it again  You'll notice i have been polite here   Welcome    I want to share a not so secret with you   Not one of us has ever been sober today before    This is it  it is all any of us get  today   Now with that in mind  there are many of us who have stayed sober  one day at a time  for a few days in a row   I wish you the best of luck on that  just keep in mind  you only need to worry  or not worry  about not drinking today     It gets better    Enjoy the journey   No more solo playing or watching of any sort or form     You don't even know how to run the sub  you're wrong about basic information    It's a goddamned embarrassment you and fucktard are a mod of  r opiates        Embarrassment   Perhaps shortbread would make a good substitute for whisky  Else  Lidl was giving out lumps of coal this year for this very purpose   I find drinking weird  too  nowadays  Basically  getting pished on NY eve is like saying "this occasion is so special that I need to make sure I remember nothing of it"    Happy new year  I played dark souls 3   all freaking day   I'm getting over the flu or the cold or some crap  but it's still better than getting over a hangover and wondering who the girl next to me is   desperately searching for an open condom wrapper   Times have changed  Hey  I just got off subs myself  day 36   it was hard  but worth it  I was on them for about 2 years also   What I really wanted to say though is that I have severe gym anxiety too  and I definitely needed to lose weight  so I bought an awesome workout DVD and started doing everything I could think of to get exercise around the house  I even started walking in circles around the living room while binge watching Netflix  My kids laughed their asses off at how ridiculous it looked  but hey     it worked    Anyway  good luck  Congratulations  may this year be filled with joy  Have I gone blind  2016 was a year of almost pure crap for me too   But one good thing did come out of it   our dedication to sobriety   Not drinking right alongside you today  I play billiards  I like to play chess as well  but I suck at it  It's fun  though  Dry people  dry places resonated a lot with me  Maybe I'll try again tomorrow  It all starts with not drinking the first drink    I won't drink with you today   Alcohol has a way of doing that  The initial feeling of pleasure comes on quickly and subsides as quickly and we spend the rest of the night drinking more  chasing that feeling  Problem is  it's a depressant and it prolongs the problems  all of them  Physical issues  Mental issues  All of them    Best way to stop this  Stop drinking  Just for today  Don't drink  Wake up tomorrow and see how you feel tomorrow  I won't drink with you today    Be kind to yourself  Do something that brings you pleasure  Hot bath  Read a book  Play video games  Cook  Binge on Netflix  Eat chocolate    Make a plan  You can do this  My dad hasn't   He has alienated his entire family     I  however  am a mom and am working really hard to recover    One day at a time    Just stop completely   you'll have to eventually anyway  Kratom will stop working and you'll be worse off than you are now  Your addict mind probably won't be able to stop completely unless you really want it  Good luck with your decision  I can relate to your problems  I missed the boat with Instagram  Besides relapse fodder  and a billion bucks  is it artistically worth anything  You are showing great restraint  Very impressive  Thank you for this  Her comment about secretly hoping to get banned and not needing an excuse to quit has hit home with me    Since the end of 2014 I have gone through periods of non gaming and gaming but I have secretly wanted my gaming PC to break so that I have a reason to get a laptop instead  I couldn't justify buying a latpop while my PC was working as it was perfectly functional and more powerful than any laptop would be so spending money on a laptop seemed like a waste   This video has made me realize I have been making excuses to keep my tools of gaming in the house and keep the temptation of competitive escapism  false fulfillment and comfort alive  Edit  I don't need an excuse to quit and get rid of my PC  I just need to do it and want the change for myself   ignoring sunk cost etc   Classic East European heritage  Where from   I'll take a guess at Poland  but edge my bets with Hungary  Same for me both counts  Started today   Thank you so much for sharing your story and thoughts with us and congratulations on one year    "There wasn't much of a grey area when it came to my addiction to alcohol  I didn't gradually become addicted to it like some  starting out with a drink here and there at social gatherings  Instead  from the get go  I drank alcohol to get severely drunk and impaired  My first night out drinking  I chugged dangerous amounts of hard alcohol  knowing it would "fuck me up " For some messed up reason  that is how I wanted to feel  My memories of that night and those first nights drinking are hazy and difficult to describe  I was 18  just out of high school  and I had not touched a drop during high school  I'm still figuring out how I went from there to daily drinking so fast  I do know that I sought out alcohol as an escape from myself and my life and from how I felt about myself  The rush excited me and made me feel like I was in control of my happiness "  Really really struck home with that  Thank you for sharing  and you're certainly not alone  I was a stiff no drugs or alcohol kid in high school and college  but after some workplace challenges  I started hitting alcohol hard  and with the exclusive goal of getting messed up as quickly as possible  That awful anxiety over feeling "not drunk enough" and wanting more   I've done so many things that make me shake my head in the pursuit of that stuff   You're an amazing person and great work getting to where you are  12 3 17 I'll be writing my own one year testament  But it is a difference whether one makes a cold withdrawal or not  You have the help of Elavil  This is of course all right   I preferred a cold withdrawal  This was really harsh  but I guess it will keep me away from Kratom forever      I won't drink with you today  Heh   And people think we are the judgemental ones  My thoughts  is this is great   Congratulations   Whoop whoop   Congrats  Thanks for sharing that  It's crazy how weed can numb the pain  isn't it  I was also having relationship issues  My smoking also pushed quite a few good guys away  and even THAT wasn't a wake up call  A guy I was dating dumped me because I was soooo cranky without weed  He was a non smoker and just couldn't deal with it  It took me sobering up to look back like damn I really let his fine ass get away because I wanted to smoke all the time  Smh  Hindsight   The number of times I fudged my numbers for doctors was epic    Agreed  It's all relative to each individual   Romania    Really close  I write and speak fluently  If I wasn't such a drunk I'd go back to translating  well  the good thing is that I'm starting a project bike with a friend  so I'll be just as broke but I won't be bored and I'll have a cook motorcycle by the end of it checking in This   One day at a time  Some people are addicts  some not  If you are an addict  maybe it's easier to give it up completely and live your life rather than fantasizing and anticipating your next scheduled high  which probably is not nearly as good as in your imagination  Bike riding   physical exercise in general is not a bad way to go   I don't know any of you  but all of you have a place in my heart  Its funny how it's so hard to find understanding amongst those who know us  yet you all offer your support despite having never met me  I don't know if i will stop drinking  Im in tears because it all seems so hard   checking in Cool beans    I was terrified walking into my first meeting     I was more terrified that I was going to die drunk     Best thing I ever did was walking into an AA meeting     I wish you the best   I feel you man  Mm I understand the thought process and what you are trying to say  however  this post seems like it will be more harmful then helpful on this sub    To each their own though   congrats on your 11 days   I've starting seeing this girl who hates cocaine and doesn't know I use it and I really like her so I'm going to try and fill up my freetime by being with her Acknowledging the issues is the first step into cold water  Unfortunately it is the easiest step  but at least you've put yourself out there and begun   If you don't mind me asking  long have you been clean  You can do this  You can  A  90 quarter would typically last me 5 days    Nearly  20 day or close to  600 month  I have spent the last of my bank account on weed more than once    I  am  so  ashamed  I really hope this is the time I quit for real  In my case it's mostly irritability  awful night sweats and vivid dreams  For example  me  I know for a fact if I smoked a spliff tonight as a one off  I'd want one tomorrow  And the day after  And the day after  I've been addicted for 3 years and now 10 days clean and never felt better  I don't even want to smell the stuff again let alone smoke it  new phone who dis I have never taken Kratom but I was a huge on off pain pill addict for years  What you've described in your first post is word for word things I experienced when in w ds  or just not taking enough  or just strung out in general       I quit all that shit   and I never feel like that anymore  Even on bad days   where stupid frustrating life shit happens  it's never as awful as what you're experiencing   Quit the shit if you can man  You'll be glad you did  While I know Kratom and narcotic pain killers aren't exactly alike chemically    they do tickle the brain in similar ways  Our bodies weren't designed to need any of this shit  And your body also has an amazing ability to heal   Does anyone know what you're going through  Face to face support is helpful   Feel free to PM me anytime  I don't post here often bc I've never taken Kratom    but your post hit me hard bc I've been there     but I'm not there anymore  You can do it  Me  I went to a hot yoga class with blacklights and a DJ instead and it was great   Happy New Years everyone   Dammit  Romania is a gorgeous country  hopefully get a chance to go there again one day  This is a lie  Kratom may seem like a miracle drug  but it absolutely is not  It prolongs your addiction and can coat a fortune  After switching from a terrible oxy and ambien habit to Kratom  I thought I had it all figured out  However  my kratom needs grew and when I eventually wanted out  I found Kratom produced some horrible opiate withdrawals  along with ssri snri withdrawals  Kratom is NOT an option for an addict  period  If you really want out  this is the looooooooong hard road   Let's do this  We can do it  Are you fucking kidding me    You and your bud have made yourselves into a goddamned joke     Go fuck yourself and your made up bullshit  Someones getting angry    Hurts to be wrong  Sigh so sad man  You could have said sorry  Fash and I are two of the most giving and forgiving members on Reddit  You come here to our place and start shit  Please enough with being so insecure  I JUST DID THIS TOO  Hahaha  great day for a walk  it seems  Congrats  OP  I'm glad you enjoyed   Oh the cunts who pre banned me are the adults    Go fuck yourself you goddamned posuer  You were proven wrong time and again  Holy Fuck you can read   I'm in the same boat as you    The first 7 days consisted of no sleep or food but I expected that  What I didn't expect was the depression that set in on day 8  Stay strong  we don't want to have to go through the withdrawal twice   I didn't realize how much coffee creamer my wife and I used until we went on a 4 day vacation out of state  We bought a quart of creamer because they never have enough in the hotels  It only took us 4 days to kill a quart of coffee creamer   Concur  chess is amazing but fret not  I suck at it too  We should start a CAshittychessclub   or not  Great post Victoria  Happy New Year  Welcome  SD has a lot to do with my making it 14 days  It has been what I lean when I need inspiration or tips to help me work through the urge to drink  Hasn't been easy  but it's gotten better     Glad you're here  Romania is beautiful  but the people are so corrupt  I haven't been back since I moved here at 11  I hope to visit soon  but family wise there's not much left there for me  Ugh  the not sleeping        I'm on day 36 off of subs and I still have a hard time sleeping sometimes  The first 2 weeks were the worst though  I barely managed an hour or 2 here   there  if I was really lucky  I really thought I was going crazy  It's amazing how much lack of sleep starts to screw with you after a while   It gets better though   once you get a decent nights sleep the sense of accomplishment is huge  I'm not sure what you're detoxing from  but hopefully it won't take you as long to get there as it does with subs   Great job  Leave  Ahhh shortbread is a good shout  I used to do it with coal when I was a kid  Scottish kid in south London though  I'm sure my neighbours were freaked out by the small girl with the weird accent standing in their doorway holding out coal    I played a game of sober new year bingo with myself on the walk into town and the walk back  Girls Crying  couples arguing  men leering  shoeless walkers  sick on the pavements  kebab remains  Got house in under a mile   Being on the outside it's so so alien   which I guess is good because it's steadily replacing the fomo  hey everybody  i'm new   been in horrible CT w d's for a week now   so far  absolutely no relief   hopefully i can continue checking in on these threads    I worked until 12 am then watched some HBO Online and woke up this morning at 1pm    there was a thunderstorm outside and I took advantage of the rumbling thunder to dream  I am 4 months sober today and a bonus I woke up to 2017 this way  So grateful and happy today   Good luck every one  I'll checkin   I was scared to death on day 2   What do you mean I can never drink again   I've been doing it for 10 months one day at a time   It does get easier  I wish I could say my dad recovered but he hasn't  I'm also losing hope of it ever happening  This past year he was hospitalized twice for alcohol induced pancreatitis  They dried him out both times  giving him the perfect opportunity to get sober and stay sober  Two days later  he picked up right where he left off which tells me he doesn't want to get sober  I believe he likes the attention it gets him too much   Sign me up I MUTED you for 72 hours because you were combative  I did not ban you  And you are now unmuted   I'm totally up for that  I would like to play chess with drunk  shitty players as myself  Thank you  I dread to think how the situation would go down if I was drinking   Absolutely  It helps me to be open and honest about what I've sacrificed  within myself  in order to maintain my habit  That brutal honesty is what helps me keep going  even if it's a shock to my ego  If I keep up the lie that "weed hasn't had any effect on me"  I get nowhere    I got to a month clean and then had a tiny relapse  took 2 puffs of a joint and immediately regretted it  and that was about 3 weeks ago  Been clean ever since    It has only been 6 days since I last smoked   This is my second serious attempt at quitting and I was doing really good last time until my partner of 30  years died and sent me into a tailspin and I reached for weed to help me through   I was clean for 3 months that time and I remember the dreams starting in the first few days   I have smoked high grade for over 30 years and was a wake n baker   I hope the dreams start soon  You don't know the kind of girl I'm talking about  Agree with r somuchtolearn    A week in and I was still a bit of a mess    Glad you're seeing a Dr   Hey man its worth it  I don't know where you are  I'm Australia   But if there's a chance of serious repercussions it's worth every penny trying to get the best result     I had to get clean for the courts  clean urine samples for the judge and I had no intention to get clean once I proved I was good and not a burden to society  Then I got given a 12 months order and had to take more drug tests  So not wanting to go to jail I tried to stick to it and thought once I hit 12 months I'm going to blaze up like Marley himself    Little did I know how amazing life would get and I saw how much weed was slowing me down  Almost 15 months clean and can now see what a blessing it was to get in trouble  I may have wasted many more years till I decided to try and quit again  Yeah  I don't get the deal with "real" ramen  It's only marginally better than the shit that's 50 cents and costs 20x more    This swig of 40 is to you and yours  May she be the subject of many good posts in 2017 but only positive ones like this    I've thought multiple times that I should give up drinking  That scares me because what would I do on the weekends  How would I relax  How would I become the chatty  funny  easy going girl everyone likes to be around   Alcohol is a really excellent crutch  it works fast  it's easy to get  and it's extremely effective at temporarily solving a lot of problems  When I decided to get sober  I had to work really  really hard to re wire my brain on a lot of things    Relaxing  Video games  some comfortable PJs and a hot cup of kava tea get the job done these days  Weekend activities  Backlogged chores errands  dinner with my parents  dates with my fiance  catching up on TV shows and video games    the list goes on  Socialization  I don't go out or socialize as much as I used to  and don't think I'm as nearly fun as I used to be   but I'm honestly okay with it  I've always been a more introverted person and I find that I'm thoroughly enjoying the extra quiet time with a clear head  I was a binge drinker from my very first drink  Today I have multiple years of sobriety and a completely different  better life  It can be done   Post surgery I was taking norcos and finally quit but still had pain  I found kratom and it works better for pain and gives me a little energy and a positive mind frame  I do not mess with extracts as I have heard they will ruin tolerance  They are also really expensive  Yes  kratom can be addictive but for me it's better than all those pills   If it weren't rather late  where knifey is  I'd propose an online game  Maybe tomorrow    Kick ass  Brother  So glad to hear that you had a good day  Keep passing it forward  Your story can help others   I found it had to be my decision to stop  just be absolutely done  I Anthony Bordaine this shit now and every day  week  month is a gift I give to myself   Thanks  I sure hope so  I stopped watching for a few years because of all of the drama  but I started watching again this year  Even if we don't win  I'm still happy with our progress this year and happy to have gotten back to the Rose Bowl  Don't matter    no wonder she don't want you  She's all over me  dude  And everyone else   Good point    I think a lot of people that smoke are depressed  Quitting will only make the depression shine strong  It requires a whole life change to get better  not just putting down the buds  I have been in your shoes trying to quit for 5  years without success until recently  I can tell you what worked for me if it helps   1  I removed access to my games  I did this by breaking my laptop and moving to a different city away from my toxic home environment  a bit extreme but in my case desperate times called for desperate measures    An alternative would be to uninstall all games  block all gaming websites and subreddits you visit  and clear your YouTube watch and search histories so gaming video recommendations don't appear   2  After my last relapse  I fully realised I was done with gaming for life   but the addiction can always trick me back into gaming and to avoid this I started avoiding anything video game related  websites  videos  even thoughts  like a plague   3  Support from others  I tried and failed to quit by myself for years as I mentioned  I now realise that getting support from others is probably essential  especially in my case as I don't have a good social support network   I do this by attending a CGAA meeting everyday  Initially for the first couple months I kept relapsing every 2 3 days despite going to meetings  eventually I began feeling a strong sense of connection and acceptance there that I feel have helped me stay off games  Other forms of support can be medical support from a doctor  therapy  having a strong social network in real life especially if there is an understanding person you can share your struggles with   4  Hobbies  Initially I felt a void as the gaming was gone which until then had given me a sense of purpose and ego  I filled up my free time with things I have always wanted to do  I started weightlifting again  cooking and eating healthy  practising piano everyday  meditating everyday  reading books etc  My new years resolution is to become more social  smile and talk more  How cool that you got ahead of this thing so young   It took me  ahem  a bit longer to come to my so called senses   Not drinking today  I would love that  But please  don't judge me  You can do it  I believe in you  I won't drink with you today  If I had guessed at how good my life would get  from me getting sober  I would have sold myself short    Don't get me wrong  there has been plenty of terrible crap during this journey  yet the good outweighed it   The simple fact is that I haven't had to drink to "cope" with anything  good or bad  in quite a few days    That is a miracle for a drunk like me    Even through the past week    I was home for Christmas  it was good  for the most part    My bride had noticed that our dog had been acting weird lately  we took her to the vet last Monday  Found out our little buddy has lymphoma    Not good  she is going to die soon    Really devastating     The guys on my job had a party on my jobsite Monday  I got back to a mess  as well as beer bottles all over my job  I was livid     My aunt died on Thursday  the last of the generation of my Mom's family     People in the hotel I am staying in threw a huge party last night  it really sucked  the were drunk and rude   Also  it's cold up in Nebraska  cold makes my reconstructed leg bones hurt really fierce   It's all about finding a balance for me  and no matter what happens  not drinking over any of it    I often say  be good to you today  you deserve it     That's what I have to do for me every day      Through it all I won't drink with you today    Exactly   This post is not a lie    Kratom is certainly not a miracle drug  It can be abused like any other drug    However  you should realize that many addicts have found peace and recovery through the usage of kratom    First of all  it's incredibly cheap online  You can have 1000 grams  about 200 strong doses  for 75  shipped of fantastic kratom    Second of all  the ssri withdrawal thing is entirely theory at this point and we dont' know that much about kratom  It is certainly true that you can withdraw from kratom  However  kratom can not kill you in withdrawals  and most people under 10 grams a day deal with the withdrawals just fine    As you said "my kratom needs grew " That means you didn't make sure your tolerance stayed low  and that means you upped your dosages  And then you stopped taking it and had withdrawals  I hope you can realize that the scenario you lived through does not necessarily apply to everyone    I help run a kratom business  I have spoken to many addicts that helped themselves through kratom  Like any drug  you should taper before jumping off   But at the end of the day kratom CAN seriously alleviate opiate and alcohol withdrawals  and it is far less dangerous than suboxone or methadone    If anyone has any questions about kratom  dosage safety  tolerance maintenance  or where to purchase cheap product  feel free to PM me  It is not a miracle drug  But it can help   Hey man  I appreciate you sharing your experience  I actually have been very resistant to the idea of going on prescription medicines because I had similar experiences in High School   For a while I was performing at a high level and getting straight A's  but then became very manic and compulsive  would end up playing Counter Strike all night and not showing up to school    Been through all sorts of differnet med combos like concerta  adderall  with SSRI's or SNRI's  as well as some anti psychotic mood stabilizers   I haven't taken a stimulant medication  or any Psychiatric drugs for that matter  regularly since I was about 18 or 19 and weaned myself off Anti Depressants   Although  I would use occassionally adderall for somethign like to finish up a paper at the last minute   I'm definitely gonna be approaching this cautiously and ask my doctor to keep the doses as low as possible   I'm not looking for this to be a permanent solution  but hopefully something that will help me develop better habits   I definitely don't think it's something I needed to be on as a kid  but hopefully as an adult I will be able to better handle it     Even then I hope to only be on this combo for a year or two at most   Gonna look into non pharmaceutical treatment options too  like CBT   Although my doctors says CBT will definitely help with depression  there is not much evidence it can do much for ADD   All I know is what i've been doing lately isn't working  and its definitely worth trying something else  I'll just have to be vigilant and make sure that I don't stick with this combo if it's not working for me either  It can feel really scary to say "I'm Rhaen  and I'm an alcoholic" to a group of strangers  I was so scared of being pidgeonholed or judged negatively or any manner of anxious things   but then when everyone tells stories of their struggles  I started to realize that I'm not alone in how I feel or my experience  It was a safe  non judgemental environment for everyone to be vulnerable about how they felt but ultimately grow and become stronger   I've only been twice in two years  and frankly SD has been like a godsend for me  and easier to attend than AA    no driving required  I hope you're able to enjoy yourself and learn what you need to learn about yourself to grow  You can do this and I will not drink with you today   Hi  I found the links shared in  this post  https   www reddit com r stopdrinking comments 5j78rw sunday solutions how i use halts and deads to get   a couple weeks back to be tremendously helpful to me when dealing with strong urges  That and seltzer water  LaCroix's good   I will not drink with you today  Day 18  No motivation    Also very hospitable though  My mate and I were basically vagabonds touring Europe for six months  Couldn't afford hostels or even food rather often  Romanians were cool as fuck  extremely generous people  usually after I told them I was Scottish  not fucking English   You're absolutely right  Thank you  Glad you posted this   Seems the video is posted and removed constantly    Two years ago I read Carr's book and quit  No even one puff  I also watched this video  frequented this sub  and explored Joel's library at why quit  If you care stop treating her like some " sloot " and lock that shit down    Or expect her to fuck around as ANY single person would not just a CA female   Hello  I have heard of some good ones in your area   West Pines  Wheatridge  has meetings including LifeRing   Also if you want to go just a little out of Lakewood  there is LifeRing on Blake St  LoDO    That's a really good group    I've had good luck with LiferingColorado org    I hope that helps   I know some folks in Lakewood but they usually come to Denver  one guys rides his bike     I hope to see you around   It's definitely more beneficial  Just try your hardest to stay away before it becomes an out of control addiction  Please take my word for it  Checking in late but I will not drink today  I guess I forgot to answer what I do   I do what I learned in AA   I talk to people about what is going on  I listen to their advice and try to incorporate it    I was so glad to learn that I don't have to have all the answers and that it's okay to ask people for help   This journey is challenging at times  I am glad I have all of you to share it with me  You kidding   It's been 24 hours and I'm in a funk    Suddenly we "aren't drinking" and"not smoking "  Fuck I hate this bullshit  I mean  yeah   We should  Let's try  But I'm not sure which is worse     I'm going to get healthy without you  or you have to do this with me    Lem's confused    And drinking Gin    I hate juniper berries   Hello and good job reaching out       It seems so scary to quit because we're so used to it   I too felt suicidal towards the end of my drinking career      Now I'm sober  I shudder to think my mind had become so twisted      You don't have to drink today   Your addiction will disagree  but it's wrong   You don't have to drink   And your life will improve when you stop       All the best to you    Please do yourself a favour and quit now  I'm 23 and I wish so badly that I had quit when I was your age  Not only would it have made such a difference to the last 7 years of my life       but it probably would have been a lot easier to quit then  The habit evolves into an addiction gradually and it really gets its hooks into you  Try to quit  If a fap feels necessary here and there  it's not the end of the world    but get porn out of your life  Seriously  Cheers man   Hey Cap'n     The Circus has an ongoing  Performance  in my head     I just choose more and more often to walk past the entrance to the Midway and go about my way on Sober Lane     All the rides and attractions and freak shows are still there at the Circus in my Head   If there are performances  it's to an empty venue   However  I know        one glass of wine  will get the lights flashing  the Barker Calling  the rides running        But  Today I choose not to attend   If today proceeds like yesterday I'll do the same thing tomorrow  Here  here   Or however that cheer of agreement goes   Congrats on the small  meaningful  deliberate  and persistent steps towards creating a better life  It sounds like much has been accomplished in only 11 months  I  too  do not make resolutions  but I do take stock and try to decide the one thing to work one first  After all  I figure I'll live much longer now that I'm sober  and  making decisions with my health in mind    Thank you for being part of this community  I appreciate how you've helped make this a place of refuge and encouragement   That's an awesome insight   For me  it was just the permission to drink at all   Saturday turned into Friday and Saturday  turned into Thursday  Friday  Saturday   the permission stopped 29 days ago  and I've permanently revoked my permission to drink  Huzzah   Happy new year indeed   Love this  Great job  I spent all day yesterday cleaning and getting the house in order  Today  I went on an early morning walk with my husband  cooked a delicious soup and watched movies all day with my youngest son  It's been a great day   Happy for you   Excercise  its gives you a goal to work towards  helps you eat healthy  and makes falling asleep so much easier when you finish a long workout  Go to r fitness if you want some more advice Congrats  1501 DAYS is completely inspiring  Hope to be there in the future  Right now  I'm at two years and one day  without even one puff  All props go to Carr's book        I like that    "It's catching "  That is a great response  Wow you are an inspiration  I won't drink with you today   Got a plan  Seriously I'm awful  Shall PM tomorrow night  This is badass  Sometimes a relapse is what gives you the genuine realization and I'm glad it worked for you  You're an inspiration and I will follow in your footsteps  Keep in touch  Would love to see the progress in your  clear headed life   She fucks around and then cry about it  She complains that she's getting laid all the time  all them attention  She's a fucking sloot  She literally cries about it  As in water coming off her eyes  FUCK HER        she's a CA also I'm sure right now it seems insurmountable  but trust us there is light at the end of the tunnel  We support you  because we know first hand the despair you are feeling right now   Clear mucus is probably a good sign  I noticed I was coughing it up before I quit smoking and within a month or so of quitting it stopped  I think it's a natural reaction to the irritation of smoking but it will probably go away soon  9 days  Way to go  Vent away  I am at day 17  and I have to say that it is going to get better  I know that you are depressed  but we are all here to help you get through it  I found that sending encouraging words to others here has probably helped ME more than anything else  We are all friends  You are one of us  Stay strong  Try helping others here that haven't made it to day 9 yet  You are brave and you are powerful  Your body is in shock  but it will get better  Keep telling yourself that  It gets better   My fianc and I decided to not drink for the entirety of 2017  A large goal right  Well it's not just for out wellbeing  It's also because we have two children and want to be better parents and lastly because the only times we fight are when we are drunk  We have decided 2017 is a make or break year for us  We are both very confident it will be a "make" year  We have problems of drinking to the point where we are too drunk  We can't just drink to have a good time and get a slight buzz we have to overdo it and then bring up all these issues from the past that don't even have anything to do with our lives now  I just want to say hello and I am glad to be here    Then drop her        I fail to see the issue  Elavil doesn't really help  I'm at 25mg and you usually need at leaSt 50mg for sleep  100 or more for mood  And to be honest  a harder wd will serve to keep you away true  I feel like the short duration and easier time with wd in comparison is what keeps me coming back  Since it's like "oh that wasn't too bad  I can handle keep taking it " But I'm trying to find other reasons to keep me away such as having more motivation  appetite and natural happiness  Sounds like you won't have a hard time staying away

gym I'm actually at the bar next door instead " Wonderful   Thank you for sharing  It is absolutely a great time to stop  while you have been doing it for less time and you have more of your life ahead of you  Stopping before it progresses further and takes over more of your life will help you so much in the long run  as well as in the short term   Stopping earlier will only benefit you  Good luck  12 bucks for ramen  Stupid Muricans  And no rape  Sheeeettttttt   Settled  It's a duel     My dad got bored with drinking  so he wasn't one of us  But  mom  may her memory be a blessing  she died due to her alcoholism    There was nothing in the world anyone could do for me when I was deep in my disease  Luckily  I got the 'gift of desperation'  and I got in enough pain to try something different  Unfortunately  my story is similar to most    Like the others have typed  Alanon gives one a lot of strength and tools for our lives when loved ones around us are sick with the diseases of addiction and alcoholism  That's awesome   Keep it going      It absolutely gets easier  Every day will have its challenges  but you're strong  and you can do this  We are here with you  I second La Croix   they usually offer it at work gatherings due to its healthier nature  and I used to pooh pooh it because it's so lightly flavored  After quitting drinking  it weirdly tastes so much better  I bought three cases of three flavors this past week and it's been great   Their cherry lime is super tasty  I won't drink with you today  It will be whatever you think it will be   so if you think it's gonna suck bc you're giving up fun stuff  then it will  But if you think it's gonna be amazing because you're living a healthier  wealthier life  then it will be  Think about it positively  and good luck   Thank you for the definition  I agree with you " Fear Of Missing Out is ridiculous   "   I never really thought of it like that until you explained it the way you did  Thank you for taking the time to answer my question  this will definitely help me if I am ever feeling FOMO  Hope your New Years Day has been a happy one  I mean you just can't imagine it  The whole family was gathered in the living room and I went and fell into the christmas tree  I thought it was fucking hilarious at the time  I still do   Needless to say I got kicked out promptly  Last year my friend fucked a xmas tree  So you OK    That's awesome  I don't mean to sound unappreciative  but I feel kind of robbed for having to move to the states at such a young age  I feel as if I've missed out on so much that living in Europe has to offer  As a young child my dad took me everywhere  I've been to quite alot of countries  but it doesn't really count  I was too little to appreciate them  All of the friends I left behind travel often and are truly living life  I feel so melancholic thinking of my home country  It's not that I don't like the US  but life here is not the same  I feel as if I've lived more in 11 years there than I have in 15 years here  And I matured in America   Issue is I would like to have her  I think she would like me too  we're very similar  That's a good start   One of the factors present in people who recover from addiction is having positive association with non using people   You really need to totally avoid the people  places  and things associated with your using history   It requires some tough decisions but the only way is to completely separate yourself from those situations   I wish you well with this new girl  but if it does not work for some reason  don't let that become an excuse to use    Kratom can be used as an opiate replacement but it is ludicrous to possess the notion that a person needing to consume something everyday to not experience withdrawal symptoms is somehow a solution to the problem of addiction   It can also be used to assist in detoxification if it is then discontinued in use   This is harm reduction far more than it is a treatment for addiction   There is a lot more that could be said on this topic but I am going to leave it at that   It is also suspicious that you're offering to help people purchase it if they PM you  as is another user that replied here whom admitted to being associated with a business   It isn't uncommon for people to come here marketing rehabs and products so please don't take offense  Yep  My plan is to not put myself in situations where I am pressured into drinking  I'm not going to visit any bars or anything and I'm also working on getting the medical help I need for some other health conditions I've been unfortunately suffering from because I haven't been keeping up on treatment  All will be good  it's just going to take some time   Then lock it down    or let her fuck   Fellow Scot here  Well done on handling that situation so well  Weird situation indeed  Yeah it sure is a weird concept  This is my second new year in a row that I entered sober  Great way to start the year   I'm in   And I'm going to go full plastic jacket this week  To make sure that I do not pick for a week I'm going to wear finger cots while reading or watching videos  anytime I'm home and idle    And all the other things I said too  Thus begins the year I spend all summer at the pool  We can do this   I relapsed  Very disappointed in myself   So I've been white knuckling for the past 5 years  out of 6    AA's not for everyone  but I wouldn't be sober today if I didn't have the support of the group and my sponsor when I first got started   Go to one meeting and see how it makes you feel   Then go to another regardless of how the first one made you feel   Listen   Share    In that order    Talk to someone   There is a great life ahead of you  but it's up to you to take the steps required to get there   Good luck  Oh lord  I was sweating bullets going to my first meeting   It's a big step   Congratulations    wow you handled that a lot better than i would have  i probably would have disowned a sibling for that   I relapsed  Very disappointed in myself   Night is young War    She already went to bed    CRY HAVOK    I don't like her fucking around  She had some bad consequences before   Anyway  she's the definition of a slut  If you google it  you'll find the picture of her  Sorry to hear about your struggles   You write "I truly am a vile human being"   I don't believe that   Based on what you share  I suspect you're similar to me in that I realized    Alcohol   Me   Undesired Consequences   I suspect  without alcohol  you're  as you write  "a decent sober guy"  I decided to eliminate alcohol associated consequences from my life  "and they've ONLY known me in sobriety "  You make a point of wanting to emphasize something here   What do you mean exactly by this emphasis if I may ask  I will do my best to phase it out of my life  thanks for the advise Slut slut slut slut   1  1    Welcome   Speaking from my own experience  your last sentence is probably the most helpful thing to internalize when you stop smoking  Also  it gets better even if it doesn't feel like it  Not drinking helps a lot too    Edit  Spelling   Sign me up please  I doubt I'll make it one year  but let's see  Yeah no wonder she fucks dudes other than you     I'd be fishing too  Maybe a couple of those Sober 30 days  or 30 day sober challenge would be helpful    Note  what I describe below was during and after the Vietnam war   Women were not in combat at that time   But many of our nurses who were in Vietnam developed PTSD as did the male soldiers    This was at a time when there was no understanding of or medical psychiatristic help for PTSD victims    I worked for the Department of Veterans Affairs for 21 years   Those burn victims and guys who had lost arms and legs  many times more than one limb  had to develop thick skins   Most of them came to realize other people's reactions say a lot about that person and not them   Some stayed angry and their lives spiraled down but most worked to deal with what they were dealt with courage and did not give up on having good productive lives   Most  of the worst comments were from young kids so they understood it was not meant to hurt but was because they were just young kids   These veterans were really great   Dealing with being seriously disfigured by burns or loss and or loss of limbs gave most a level of mature wisdom that some people without these types of challenges may never achieve   These were young guys with the rest of their lives ahead   The majority of them mentally and emotionally transcended their physical challenges   It was an honor to know them and very humbling   They demonstrated courage at its highest level  Nice job   Getting advise like this will really help me to quit  thank you  I  too  have lost 10 years of my life to alcohol   We can do this   I will not drink with you today  It would help  Removing access to gaming is important for the first few days at least  Other things would be to avoid reading about or watching video game related content  If you feel you are addicted  I am not saying you are  only you can make this call  then you will need to avoid gaming  and gaming related content  for good if you want to avoid relapses  I'm sorry but this just isn't true  at least not for me  Kratom saved my life  As addicts we are all very all or nothing  I understand that  I live that in spades  When I started dieting and losing weight as a fat kid  I went all in  Zero junk food  zero soda  weighed my food  not a single carbohydrate touched my lips  I ended up bulemic  for real  I was about 160lbs with no real muscle mass as a 6'0 6'1 adult male  I wanted to keep losing weight  Any day I would cheat even the slightest I would fall into a deep depression and binge  When I started working out I killed myself  at home and at the gym  I drove myself to puking and migraine headaches  If I missed a workout I fell into a deep depression and stayed on my couch for months  As addicts we are wired to be all or nothing  All  or nothing  And both manifest themselves in different ways  at different times  in varying degrees  I tried that with heroin  I did cold turkey  I did Suboxone  Cold turkey never worked  Suboxone made me feel like a sucker  not to mention very sleepy at times   so I stopped trying  I got worse and worse  Kratom came into my life and I stopped doing heroin  Kratom went out of my life for a few weeks and I didn't continue doing heroin  I don't use kratom everyday  I don't care if I run out  It was as painful as running out of coffee  and both are honestly pretty shitty  If the day comes where the DEA decides to prohibit kratom  so be it  My life isn't run by when or where I'll be getting my next fix anymore  That's how I know kratom truly provided a much softer landing for me and helped me kick this filthy habit      Now excuse me I have my 8 30p gay for pay appointment so I can buy moar kratom  Quitting has also caused me to have issues with my SO    I'm just so irritable without weed    No more numbing emotions I guess  Stay strong and tough it out  and definitely don't cheat  Good luck  we are here for you  Thanks for the good luck  I will do my best to stop it before it becomes a large issue Wow   I hope everything works out for you  Thank You  I made my first one   Sending Kind Words your way  You're not paying attention  I have sex with her  no problem  She has sex with god and the world  after I'm done  I can't see how you view this as NORMAL  cause it's not  Guy or gal Pretty sure the OP is not a seller  but I get your point  Harm reduction is correct  I never took the pills for the "high"  and kratom dies not get me "high"  so I don't feel any craving or desperate need for kratom  I just take it for pain relief  I do not take it to avoid withdrawals  in fact I often forget to take it if my pain levels are low  I'm so sorry   I really hope you find a way to stop doing this to yourself  and find a good place with you and with food   I'm no expert  Hahaha good story  Then tell her YOU want a relationship    Man up  I am on Day 9 also   congratulations to us   I can't say whether it gets better since we are in the same boat  But I feel ya on the mood swings  Do you have anyone  a physical person  you can talk to about all of this  My partner has helped immensely because he knows everything I'm going through and has helped pull me out of the depressive episodes I have been having since quitting   If not  keep venting to us    Well  I'm proud to say that I attended my first meeting  The people seemed easy going and receptive  We read through a section of the book  Emotional Sobriety  which launched a vulnerable and insightful discussion about self centeredness  During most of the meeting  I picked up on a feeling of re centering myself  Not just on my pursuit to quit drinking  but I felt anxieties of other aspects of my life ease as they were brought into perspective  I really appreciate the emphasis placed on God to help us live purposefully in the moment  As alcohol became a larger and larger component of my life  my spiritual journey suffered  I feel this will be excellent in helping me rid of alcohol and perceive my upcoming week with a clearer reference frame on the things that matter    In the last share out of the meeting  someone remarked on the topic of selfishness that they sometimes went  all in  to serve others  leaving themselves frayed and broken  So it was important for this individual to be dutiful about self care  I resonated with this idea  thinking that my lack of self care led to greater consumption of the easy  numbing fix alcohol tantalizes  With my perspective and self care out of wack  I became resentful at the very situation I was serving in  expecting greater appreciation  So that's my messy realization  But there's much hope  I think these meetings will be very good for me to get outside of myself    Thank you for the encouragement  You all rock   D Really is  just nice to enter it clear to set the tone for the rest of the year  I dunno what to do about this situation  I may ask her to just keep him in her room when he's visiting  Making cereal in my pants feels weird with an ex lurking in the corner  Where was the ramen   I'm trying to quit drinking coffee too  So watching almost everyone in the room sip on their coffee bummed me out  But the people were terrific  I was addicted to Benzos for 3 years  tapered it down and made a cold withdrawal at home   b t w  for me it was much easier than Kratom   probably just luck   My raging hate against this crap was probably the most important reason why I never took a pill again      Thanks guys  I actually feel better already   This support is amazing  Thanks man  Feel free to PM me as well if you ever need to talk   you can still jerk it if you'd like    Just not to porn    It will do wonders for your psyche and imagination  Masturbation is healthy and natural  porn is not   Thank you so much for saying this    day 17 seems so far away  Congratulations  I am so happy I found this sub  Or massive panic after a blackout wondering what you did  how you got home and if you still have friends for days afterwards Happy New Year  Last night  I took my mentally disabled brother so our parent's could have a new years to do adult things  They wound up sitting around  not knowing what to do without a child to take care of  amd went to bed early  Lol Parents  man      I made up a bunch of snacks and we settled onto the couch while I tried not to puke or pass out  I'm pregnant  not drunk  but sometimes it feels pretty damn similar     As soon as my SO got home  he took over babysitting and I pulled up a live stream of the NYC ball drop and we celebrated midnight an hour early    All in all  it was a nice quiet evening and I woke up feeling a little better  Happy 2017  Quitting cold turkey  Will try to avoid just about anything game related unless it's a couch party game among friends   Gonna try to make this a permanent change  but shooting for 90 days minimum  Absolutely need to and want to spend my time on other areas of life  college  health  friends  family   Best of luck to you all   No amount of willpower can combat a true addiction  Some things I did was to clear my youtube watch and search histories so gaming related videos don't appear on suggested videos  stopped using laptop and switched to an old ipad  filled up my free time with hobbies so I am not left bored and craving for games  I told my gamer friends that I am quitting gaming for good and to please not talk about anything game related with me Keeping up with real friends  Don't browse the trending or anything  Welcome   There's an "official" check in each day  that usually posts early a m  U S  eastern time    At this link  Is Todays Check in   https   www reddit com r stopdrinking comments 5ldn21 daily checkin for sunday january 1st good or bad      Also  u VictoriaElaine was kind enough to provide a Welcome at this link  Some Helpful Guidelines   https   www reddit com r stopdrinking comments 5lh0we a huge welcome      Glad youre here   detach with love   I don't want to have a relationship with a sloot  goddammit  It's a shame though  she's such fun  Too bad she sloot around so much  I know  One of my boys has been on it for eight years  He said his doctor told him that no one in his county has been on Suboxone as long as him  Fucking crazy    I'm with you  brother   One week in so far  going cold turkey   No relief in sight   I barely have enough energy to type this   Nothing helps  no vitamins  no nothing   I know this will take time   I'm with you all the way   We can do this  My ex was just like that  He would get black out drunk  and say the most horrible things to me or kick me out  then beg for me back the next day  claiming not to remember what he did  I left him  so I don't know how to fix you as we never figured out how to fix him  but when dealing with him  we tried to make sure he ate enough food that night and didn't drink too quickly  ofc that didn't always work out  but it seemed to help  So drink in moderation and eat lots of pizza on binge nites  maybe   Good luck to you tho  dude  And if you are my ex  I hope you've been doing well     That's implied by the "major things" line  I suppose my ham handed attempt at a little self reflective humor didn't come across as such   Bye HotS I got into a massive fight with my boyfriend over some chick spraying her bf with a spray bottle    Like what the actual fuck is wrong with me  He's the only one that knows the extent of my smoking  other than maybe my dealer  and we haven't talked in 2 days now    Congrats on your day 9 as well  Im so happy to have someone who understands what I'm going through  this sub is really great    Good luck  You can do this     After Day 3 all nicotine is expelled from your body and it becomes easier  After 3 12 weeks your brain chemistry rights itself and you lose the mood swings that come with quitting   Lots of people here recommend the Allen Carr book   I've not read it  but it's helped my cousin and a good friend    I use the SmokeFree app  like you  and found it really helpful  especially the paid content   I justified it by rationalising that it costs about the same as half a pack of cigarettes where I am  so went for it   and it really helped   I relied on it a lot more toward the beginning and now rarely check it  but it still helps me feel proud of what I've accomplished   Setting your badge on this subreddit helps too  I've been tempted a couple of times and then thought  "But I'd have to reset my badge   "  It sounds daft  but it works   Tell everyone around you that you are quitting  This also helped me in a moment of weakness when I asked a friend for a cigarette and he persuaded me that I didn't want it  It also means that friends don't invite me now when they go out for a cigarette  removing the temptation for me   On the downside  you have the infamous Smoker's Flu to look forward to   LOADS of water   herbal teas will help with this  Guaifenesin can help as it's an expectorant and will help you cough the nasty stuff up  Similarly  using a sauna or breathing in steam  hot showers baths  can help   Think about when you're most likely to crave a cigarette and plan to do something to subvert it  If you have a plan  you're less likely to cave   For me  it's leaving work  Work has been long and stressful and I've ingrained the habit of sparking up as soon as I'm out of sight of the building  which makes me feel relaxed and less stressed   but all that's happening is that the stress of nicotine withdrawal is relieved  not the stress from the situation  Over time  I've conflated the two   So  I made myself an audio file of a load of vocal exercises to sing instead  which releases endorphins and engages my mind  and I can't physically smoke if I'm doing it   Do you have a cigarette after you finish breakfast  Do 5 minutes of yoga stretches instead  After tea  Go for a 10 minute power walk  When you're bored  Download a load of free games for your phone or take up a hobby that needs your hands  crocheting  painting models  whittling  etc    Take a little time every day to reflect on how much better you feel  Within a day your breathing should be easier  Take a deep breath and let it out slowly  revelling in how much air your lungs can hold   Smell your hands and enjoy them not smelling like an ashtray  Eat a really nice snack and enjoy how much better things taste  Light a candle and enjoy the smell of it that you wouldn't have been able to notice before    Good luck   you can do this   Great tip on the app  We got this   Well done   You are exactly right  u often dont get REM sleep when your high  When I felt like you do now  I went to an AA meeting and spilled my guts  I was so completely desperate that I actually got a sponsor and did all 12 steps  It has worked well so far  This is great to hear   As a fellow parent  it feels great to finally walk out of the fog and be completely present with my littles   sounds like you are feeling the same   Also can I have your job  Geez I would love to just decide one day to hire someone to take over so I could coach     Cheers   COMBATiVE    ARE YOU  COMPLETELY TWISTED ON DRUGS     You  wanted to talk to  me  there     But you banned me so that couldn't happen    What part of this do you not understand  I wouldn't put up with it personally but I guess it depends on how serious the relationship was feelings towards the ex  At least she knows you're not cool with all the shenanigans going on  Lol  to last sentence   sign me up please  It's weird  but even though I mentioned my intention to quit alcohol to friends and Reddit  I still felt I had an out  I felt that I could announce after a month that I accomplished what I set out to do and that would be that  But by going to a meeting  I was forcing myself to consider who I was  alcoholic or not  and whether I was going to do real work about it like so many others in the room  When I've described the situation to friends  I described myself as addicted to alcohol instead of stating that I'm an alcholic  for reasons that I haven't altogether unpacked  Thank you for your perspective   I never thought of doing it that way  I will give it a try Then it's not a CA issue    move on or dont I spoke to a counselor   She recommended meetings   I went and found support  tools  resources and fellowship   I've not looked back  ARE YOU NUTS    You and your buddy can't even make it so we can talk on your subreddit    You guys are like an unfunny bad news bears  The potential friendships were one of the strongest incentives for me attending  I hope I come away with some valuable ones   Welcome   Good to have you with us    Boom Nice  you're past the hardest part definitely  Hey I'm sober in Wisco too  There are lots of us actually  even though it might not feel like it     Yep it is ridiculous but I was actually guilty of this with a friend of mine in the past  I genuinely wanted him to drink with me because I thought he wouldn't have fun without it  I didn't realise that no one needed alcohol to have fun and I also didn't realise he had a drinking problem but looking back it was pretty obvious  We are so conditioned to equate alcohol with fun but it's just not true  The book I suggested covers this in lots of detail  it is interesting to step back and look at alcohol marketing and what it is actually showing compared to the reality  But your SO really needs to support you  My sobriety is the most important thing in my life because without I loose control of my life   You are fine over there  Quit the Bull Shit  Hahahahahahahahahahaaaaaa     ahhahaahahahaaaaa     hahahahahahaha    You two are a joke    Only an idiot would take you seriously at this point    And you mod a medium sized sub    Those poor bastards      That I can agree with  Sorry I sounded too bitter  I'm moving on  it just takes time and a bit of suffering  My Sweet Prince   Placebo makes me cry almost every time  It wasn't serious  but after we stopped seeing each other he would turn up to my shows  hang out with my friends  just generally always turn up to stuff uninvited  When my housemate matched with him on tinder I said don't go there and my main problem is that for the last year he's always been there  and now a month later he's always in my house  Weird bad vibes  Glad you made it  My suggestion is to try to go to a meeting every day if you can  and try a whole bunch of different types out  Some may not resonate  and that's okay  Just seek out the similarities in your story with whatever you hear  and eventually you will feel more comfortable  When I was early in recovery  if I didn't feel like talking  I would go to an open talk and just listen   it takes the pressure off a bit  But meetings where you get to share and talk specifically about the steps  the big book  etc  are also great   Yes  It was the pidgeonholing that put me off  I'm more things than an alcoholic  But that is my label  my introduction  in that moment that I had to  and have to  accept  This makes sense to me  At five days sober you have pretty good insight  It's scary  Even after all these 24hrs  I remember the fear  I was desperate  So desperate that it made me willing to do anything to get well  I was lucky  One day at a time  more will be revealed   Be careful with the party especially within the initial 90 days  Take initiative to organize activities with your friends outside of the house as much as you can     He fucked the tree  or the tree fucked him   And this is the probelm witb people  I said for me  myself it doesnt cause WDs and I was posting to help others as it can be used to get off the hard stuff and when stopped the issues if any are no where near as bad  But I'm not going to argue with you because I feel you're one of those types who swears weed is bad but methadone  subs  cigs  and coffee are perfect  Do some reading  kratom is in the same family as coffee     An I bet AA NA or some other meetings are the only way right     I'm not offering to gets people's info I'm willing to show them a public list that's updated daily of well known respected vendors who are actually real companies not some dude on Craigslist   Banned from modmail for being combative  Unbanned now so you can talk to me there on the subreddit on my post  Not through modmail  Thank you so much for sharing this  I'm at day 2 and reading this really helps  Thank you   When I drink  I indulge my self centeredness     Alcohol fuels my self indulgence and selfish tendencies     When I was having a "few" glasses of wine every night  I may have been physically in the same room with my family  however  I was  not truly present        I was  Impaired    In effect I was  stealing  from my loved ones   What do you want for yourself  You'll live     Don't disrespect broads in the process     " CA is full of women  " I'm confused on the fight topic   you are mad at him because a girl sprayed her boyfriend    Regardless  that sounds tough   I can't imagine having a drawn out argument right now with my partner on top of trying to quit smoking   I can see why you are so stressed out       What works for me is going to AA meetings 3 4 times per week  fighting through my fear of public speaking to tell me story at said meetings  having a sponsor  and hanging out with people like me   You can do it   Sign me up sir  here's to January and beyond  Day 2 here too and hungover AF  The worst is over and you will start feeling better soon  Hang in there  you're not alone  He fucked the tree  The guy is mad  I have been banned from bars for shit he has done  "You know xxxxxxx  Sorry  You can't come in "  Agreed  Going Cold Turkey  I'm currently at almost my first 24 hours without a cig  Cravings aren't too unbearable yet   I have relapsed my whole life  Sometimes I'd go 2 months  4 months  5 months  etc   but a relapse always occurred  Why  The biggest factor was personal influence   Someone once told me "You are defined by the people you associate yourself with"  and I think that has stuck in my mind the hardest  When you have a gaming addiction  your main circle of friends will be gamers  When you try and dispose of gaming  but not of your friends  a relapse is all but eminent   The last time I relapsed  I was gaming free for about 4 months  I went on Skype with some of my old gaming friends to see how they were doing  and they were all playing Hearthstone  which was a game I played all day every day  They told me about a new card that came out which was meta defining  and being somewhat interested in seeing it's ability  they showed me some decklists and it instantly brought back all the feelings of gaming I've tried my hardest to stay away from  I thought it would have absolutely no effect on me  but later that night I found myself falling asleep to a few Hearthstone streams on Twitch  The following week I had Hearthstone  Heroes Of The Storm  Overwatch  and Rocket League all re downloaded on my computer  and then proceeded to play games for 10  hours a day for the next 3 months   This time around I have told my friends that I can no longer participate in the topics of gaming  and that I need to spend the next several months getting my life back together  I have blocked all sorts of websites  and cleared my Youtube account of any gaming recommended videos  Welcome    and happy new year to you  too    This is a good place to be  Glad you're here with us  I will join you in not drinking today  I apologize  I'm drunk  you know  What a great day  And the cake sounds delicious  Happy New Year and anniversary  and bday to your husband   Lots to celebrate  Maybe he's been shooting placebos  That's why the sugar wouldn't dissolve     Do you really gotta downvote me  C'mon grow up  Thank you very much  I'm glad  glad is not really the right word  that this resonated  There's comfort I think in feeling understood  and makes it not as lonely of an experience  Feel free to PM me if you ever want to talk     Don't care   no reason for it    I'm not hate'in on all these CA men living in their mama's basements trying to holla    Free love  I realize it seems impossible right now   Please know that many  many of us have been exactly where you are   You can change things   You will want to change things if you give yourself a chance   My advice would be to go to the ER  Ah  props to you for giving up the coffee  too   I've heard great things about giving up caffeine  nicotine   or drinking all at once   I admire your strength and am glad to hear you enjoyed the company at the meeting     It can definitely feel like a label  but it might help to come conceptualize it as a common reason you're there  helping yourself and helping others in community  It also helped me really see that for myself  this is a problem which I needed to get under control   In talking about here at CA genius   And swearing and threats  Damn so sad  The first day is the worst  you should feel like you are hanging on by the skin on your teeth   side note that is the strangest phrase    Your body's homeostasis has included constant weed for how many years  Now you just take it away from it   so every neuron in your reward center is probably screaming at you to bring the good stuff back  Just recognize that your brain is LYING  and try to distract yourself until tomorrow   Also don't worry about Day 3  Day 4 etc  The fastest way to make yourself want to smoke is to tell yourself you can't smoke for the rest of your life    that sounds impossible right  Makes you want to throw in the towel  So just breathe and tell yourself you only are going to abstain for today   Worry about tomorrow  later   Much love to you  You can do it   You're a joke    Fuck off    Start with today  Go to a meeting  probably tomorrow at this time   It all starts with the desire to stop  You've already got that part  Hugs  This was something that took me a LONG time to realize  Way too long  Extracts are way to expensive  kills tolerance  and to me defeat the whole purpose of choosing kratom  Sure it may have very mild WDs but they are not even close to what opiate WDs are but some like me don't have any WDs or they are so minor I don't even notice them because I've had opiate WDs so many times  I was also amazed at how much it helped with pain and that's the main reason I take it now  I initially had no plan to use it for pain either  You didn't know wnat you were doing then  chief  you banned me from posting on your entire shitty site    Moron  By day 22 I woke up feeling a shit load better  It was like a switch went off and it's been a steady increase everyday since  Been on this shit so long forgot what "normal" even feels like  Keep grinding bro  you'll hit the 30 day mark before you know  Whenever you get a craving  try and remember that it will soon pass  Good luck  Most of what I do is book keeping  I own a few retail stores in some smaller towns with no competition  Before I started smoking I actually strived towards goals   created something  Thank God I did that before smoking  bc once I started all the motivation went away  Hired employees and walked away to stay at home to do my books and smoke  It's not a life for me  I've always inspired to make a difference  Smoking made me content   Awesome  thanks for the suggestions  I've heard good things about them before   Over 12 years here    just stopped     it's going to suck    but it's for the better good right  3 Either way  it sounds painful      Reminds me of someone here using a toilet brush one time  I'm sure no one can guess who    Hey baby  looks like someone wants to whine    Unfortunately  everyone with half a brain no longer takes you seriously     Go fuck yourself    Thanks  I don't drink and this was my last vice  I am at day 15 and feel good  I'm a little spacy  which I didn't expect  Quitting coincided with 2 weeks off work  I go back Tuesday  I believe I will be fine but will continue to read all your posts to stay hooked in  For me it's being thankful I don't black out then wake up staring at a drain in the floor of the county jail   Hiking with the little guy for me  Sober morning started at 6  would have been torture I'd had been up drinking til the wee hours  Happy 2017 Sobernauts  Good job on your first week  I'm on day zero  Not a huge new year's resolution person  but I kind of needed some sort of a 'cue' like turning of the year  to give me a bit of a push  Already being an testy biotch but oh well  Keep up the good work      In a bowl  Do you live in a barn   Ahhh that is messed up   Also weird of your flatmate to go there too given the circumstances  when i was 16 I was a full blown porn addict I was watching porn for hours a day and It took me down some dark roads in my life  see porn is a drug  masturbation is fine and natural people have being doing it since the beginning of mankind  porn however is not natural or realistic  sex isn't like what you see on the screen      Doing the same thing man  You can do it   If you want to stop smoking you can't have "just one today" or else you are still smoking   Or at least that is what I am telling myself  Don't be scared   Everyone is there for the same reasons you are  and you should find that everyone is welcoming and happy to have you there  When I got sober the first time in my twenties I spent a few good years in AA  just know that if you don't click with the first meeting you go to there are tons more for you to check out with different people   they're all a bit different  Don't be scared  and you have nothing to be ashamed of  The people in AA genuinely want to help and are glad to have you there  Have fun    I just turned 31 and had the same realization  From 19 31 I was stoned  I figured why not give a year or a few years sober a try  Thanks man I can't friggin' wait to feel even slightly better   I am determined  He thought it was funny that this girl was spraying her boyfriend with the bottle  and I got pissed at him for being "immature" and thinking that's funny and cute  Totally stupid and illogical  I know   I guess all those emotions I repressed with weed are coming out now  Or maybe it's just a withdrawal symptom  Not excusing my actions but that wouldn't have happened if I was high     wow i could have written this   almost at a year myself   good fucking stuff man  This is how I quit too  Only vaped for the first two weeks and drastically brought the nicotine to 0 and then I threw it away     Congrats on quitting cigarettes  You got this  The freedom you will feel when nothing has control over you anymore is amazing  Good luck   You know before this post and you showing your true colours I thought you might have been cool to be invited to  the place we do not talk about here  Where we do not mention the name  But After this Forget about it  I see why you are not liked now  An angry insecure  nasty drunk  Kratom is not that bad and I can see you're just a troll  I'm sure you're one one of the people who down votes every single thing posted on a certain sub  Did I not say if you buy it at a headshop it's extremely over priced  At the prices online with well known vendors it's very cheap compaired to opiates or the clinic  That's you're own fault if the case but I'd bet money you've never even taken Kratom with this comment or you were taking extracts and if that's the case you're not very bright  I'm sure you're ok with subs or methadone right  Sure there may be very minor WDs in SOME but what you're talking about is from extracts if anything related to kratom  Extracts defeat the purpose of kratom and are for idiots trying to get high off it  Feels good to be on here again  two months in a row  Here's hoping for a porn free 2017  You will feel very happy when you wake up tomorrow morning and you did not smoke today   Give yourself the opportunity to feel that feeling  Wtf loooool  Check in LOL  you're a joke  didn't read your post  D    That's what you get for lying  I love this post and everything you said is right  not today It does get easier but you have to be tough with yourself     especially the first few days   You made a decision to be successful in 2017   I have an inkling that if You cave in to your excuses to smoke  You might feel that You let Yourself down   I am only at the tail end of my first week off weed and it is already much easier to abstain   I give myself permission to eat anything I want or buy anything I want or basically do anything I want except no smoking weed   I start looking after myself really well   I be very kind to myself   I know all about the excuses and reasons the addicted mind comes up with to pick up the weed again   That is all they are excuses from the addicted part of your brain   Hang onto the logical part of your brain        the one that says You want 2017 to be a success   Picture the addicted part of your brain as an ugly little weasel whispering in Your ear   Don't listen to him   He is one sick little beastie   As Your clean days accumulate  the abstaining becomes much easier   You can do this   I have smoked for 30   years wake n bake daily style of the highest grade   This is the second time I have quit   I picked up again because of the death of my partner but I am getting back on my feet and I want to be a success too   Keep Strong  It does get easier but you have to be tough with yourself     especially the first few days   You made a decision to be successful in 2017   I have an inkling that if You cave in to your excuses to smoke  You might feel that You let Yourself down   I am only at the tail end of my first week off weed and it is already much easier to abstain   I give myself permission to eat anything I want or buy anything I

but I am getting back on my feet and I want to be a success too   Keep Strong  Tsk Tsk  Those pale blue eyes are getting red  Careful  Check in  Isn't it the best feeling  To enjoy life and remember it  Great job  thanks   7 years 4 months since last drink  hiked this morning  100 push ups  feels good man   Yea at this point being totally sober feels "exciting" because being messed up has become my norm     Well done guys good effort    Sending encouragement   My mind obsesses about that which has not occurred  and indeed may  not  occur   There's an apt acronym   FEAR is my mind believing that   F  uture   E  vents   A  re   R  eal   My first meeting   I was made to feel welcome     I often go to meetings when I travel   I find the meeting address  arrive a little early and just say to the first person I see "I'm new here  how does it work "  There are no "requirements"   You don't even have to talk except possibly "I'd just like to listen"     You are of course invited to share as little or as much as you desire   I find fellowship  tools  resources and support   I've made some of my best sober friends at meetings     I hope to hear about your experience  That's awesome  The sooner the better  I don't miss reading texts I barely remember sending or knowing I was mad when I woke up but not remembering why I was mad  Nope  don't miss it at all   I dunno    she sounds pretty awesome to me When I was 25 like yourself I too was convinced that I had a special kind of alcoholism  that mine was the high functioning kind and that I would continue along with drinking a six pack of strong IPAs every night for the rest of my life  What I learned myself  and what I've seen in others since getting sober about two years ago at 29  is that "high functioning" is not a type of alcoholism  rather it is a stage of alcoholism and for some it lasts a bit longer than it does in others  I juggled a lot of things with a good amount of success until one day it was all too much  Alcoholism is a progressive illness  it is simple physiology that our bodies will require more and more of a substance to achieve the desired effect as time passes and tolerance continues to build  Nobody is immune from this unfortunately    Some are able to stop before it gets really bad  I had to experience it myself to be convinced that I absolutely had to stop drinking if I wanted to have a happy  successful life  Are you convinced that you need to stop drinking in order to achieve your goals   Feel more alive and more present  in conversations I find it easier to express my thoughts etc  and engage with strangers more like at the shops or in public just you know passing comments where I would usually just think 'I should say x' and actually do nothing  now I say it  A bit more confidence and pride in who I am instead of feeling guilty  I had no idea I would get so many replies on this  Every single one of these replies has touched my heart and meant a lot to me and I feel grateful to know that many other people understand what I'm going through  If you guys can get through this  so can I  You're allowed to now   Congrats on finally making the decision to quit  As far as spending money goes  I feel you there    I've emptied my bank account on weed more than once    I'm 9 days sober and looking back on how much money I wasted makes me feel sicker than the withdrawal does   Tomorrow when you wake up and don't smoke  your day won't be foggy  You'll have a clear memory of the morning  afternoon and night  Stay strong  it's going to be worth it  It worked both ways for me   The anxiety and depression made me some uncomfortable that I wanted to drink to numb the pain   But the residual alcohol anxiety and other mental physical symptoms of drinking too much made me so miserable that I finally became motivated to quit   I have thought before that it's like the dentist for me   I have weak teeth and am afraid of the dentist so I generally delay cleanings check ups  but once I had an infected root   The pain was so intense  I couldn't get there fast enough to do whatever it took to alleviate the issue  just like I couldn't bear the misery I felt after drinking anymore  Sure  It will gonna cost you some money  It's not cheap to dial to Brazil  Good luck coming here and fucking one of our underaged prostitutes  You'll get a bullet in your forehead  in the process  most likely  You may want to switch to ibuprofen which isn't as gnarly on your liver  Dandelion tea or apple cider vinegar are good for liver assistance  Good luck to you  I'm hoping to make the change soon  That I had a pattern of choosing the wrong friends  I bet you wish you were back in the sub you're fucking up as a mod  then you could ban big  bad ole me for calling you on your bullshit    But here little baby you can just cry  cry  cry   Waaaaah  You sound exactly like me  I also own my own business  worked at home and at the end was smoking 3 5g's a day of the best stuff you can get every hour a huge bowl through the most expensive bong you can buy in my area  illegal state   Day 7 here  Day 1 6 was rough  finally had a good day today    I believe in you man  I'm certain with all you have accomplished that this will be just another celebratory accomplishment  Hang in there and holler at me if you need someone to talk you out of smoking or if you need to talk  Just have the mindset to do whatever it takes    You got this   If quitting during your normal routine is too difficult   you might consider changing your routine for this change  It sounds like that is what you did with your Europe trip   I found it impossible to just quit in the middle of the work week and keep on my routine because of all those regular times I was smoking  e g  before class  while preparing food  etc  so I used time away from home to get the first few days under my belt   Regardless   good luck  Good work   Will def check out that loseit pge  Cheers  Youre a fucking joke  you dumb fuck eat a dick  We have to heat our dope why  Because you saw it in a movie once  Shit for brains  I won't drink with you  too   I'm grateful for this sub  for my sobriety    for online non drinking buddies like you  too     New clarity in my view of life  greater respect for women  Motherfucker have you ever made Kool aid  Did you fucking heat it up  I bet your dumb ass did  sending love and support your way  find an AA meeting near you and hang out with the people   they all know exactly what youre going through  I don't really have any advice  just my experience   I was a daily drinker for many many years and managed to raise a family  make it through medical school  residency  and begin practicing medicine successfully   Then as life became more taxing and feelings or fear  guilt and shame piled up I drank more and more to cover those things up   I was still functional   But then it progressed to interfering with the professional and family life all while I was in complete denial   The day I lost my job I still denied I had a problem   And the thought of never drinking again terrified me   For me this disease was progressive   It never got better  only worse with time   And my attempts to quit on my own failed   It was only with admitting my problem and accepting outside help that I began to heal physically and emotionally   I've a ways to go but I feel a hell of a lot better than I did one year ago   I wish you the best  You are not a prick  you are human  We are all in the same boat  and know exactly what it's like to allow addiction to let you down over and over again  Last time I went to my dealer I said "I think this is the last time I'll re up" and he laughed and said "how long ya been saying that now " While that was just a small comment  it hit hard  You have to really decide to quit  and you can  Stay strong friend  we are all here for you   Edit  as far as the anti depressants go  you can get something over the counter called Sam E  in the US it is OTC   It helps me more than actual prescription antidepressants did  and no dr visit required   Yeah man you can do it have some faith  In your post read a lot about how alcohol does not  harm  your life    How does alcohol   enhance   your life    I never suffered any tangible consequences of daily drinking  Having lived sober for awhile  I am able to see what alcohol was sneakily keeping me from   true enjoyment  peace  rest  meaningful interactions with loved ones  no matter the time of day   and money  my hobbies are way more fun and less a guilty pleasure these days    I haven't stopped drinking  forever   I have decided  not to drunk    today      Have you considered 30 60 90 days without alcohol just to see what abstinence looks and feels like for you  Ultimately only you can decide if some  a little  or no alcohol is the right choice for you   The name of the place  fuckface   Oh shit  I read your little story    Whoops    What makes you think I'd want to be in a group with a little bitch like yourself     BWAHAHAHAAHHAA    Dummy  Your vagina  you are doing it wrong   I've never heard of the BBA way either  but I can share that working on the fourth step can kind of suck any way you do it  Think about it   you are writing down all of these resentments and bad things you've done  and short of seeing some patterns  you aren't at a point where you're seeing the upside to doing this  But the freedom that comes with completing the FIFTH step   it can only come from taking that moral inventory in the fourth  Actively working on the fourth  it's a matter of putting one foot in front of the other and doing the work to get through it  It doesn't need to be perfect  nothing does   but it needs to be done   Going to meetings and talking about it helps a lot because most people I've met have struggled in the fourth step  Never forget that it is just one of the twelve   you won't be in that mental place forever  I keep feeling like that that I have repressed all this emotion over my time smoking that now I can't deal with shit because usually I would be high and I wouldn't really give a shit  I'm trying to turn my life around but everytime I try to quit u always smoke again then I feel shit for it but still end up smoking again  I don't know how to escape this cycle  well done for day 9  that's fucking impossible at this point  Here's to attempting day 1 tomorrow morning When I was in college I had a brief moment of clarity and was able to see that alcohol and drugs were probably decreasing my quality of life rather than enhancing it  But my grades were good and I was achieving all my goals  so I did not see sufficient reason to change  I did things my way for the next 17 years   got married  had kids and was tremendously successful in my profession  But my overall enjoyment of life was steadily decreasing all the while  Everything that was truly worthwhile became just another obstacle to be endured until the next time I could get drunk or high  I had everything I was supposed to want  but at the end  I found myself driving through an ice storm  looking for a good bridge to drive off so I could finally end the pain  I decided in that moment that maybe I had a disease that I hadn't treated  so I reached out for help  That was 16 years ago  Today  I can say unequivocally that I would not trade my worst day sober for my best day drinking  There is so much profound yet subtle beauty in this world that I could never appreciate during all those years I was chasing the perfect buzz  For me  the best chemical euphoria is just a cheap imitation of the genuine joy that now get to feel on a regular basis  Yes  sometimes I may be less outgoing than I was while drunk  but I am always more present and more authentic  and I'm not willing to give that up today  yeah you made the right move coming over here  Porn is the problem not masturbation  people have being fapping since the beginning of time without any sexual problems but when high speed porn came it became like a drug for a lot of people including myself I could spend hours every day and multiple orgasms on a screen and then fetishes started forming and I went through a dark time in my life and that was because of PORN not fapping  nofap is just as unrealistic as porn with people talking about how there never going to fap again thats just setting urself up for a fall  goodluck mate I hope everthing works out for you Thank you  Hahaha you dont even know what Im talking about  Come talk to me in a year when you have put your time in here at CA  Im the baby just because I can find words that dont involve swearing  I hope that maybe you are really loaded and read up on this tomrw and think man I fucked up bad  But then again you already proven you cant admit when wrong  New goal   no nuts in tissues 2017  Record currently 1 1  New slogan     No more fiends in 2017     Edit   slogan might be changed to   Less fiends in 2017    What do you guys thinks  That was my original plan with leaving  I came back   went "oooooo weed" and that was it   I run my own business so I'm trying to vary up my routine to help  Wake up  make breakfast  hit the gym  actually go out and work at a coffee shop    instead of    just sitting at my computer  That is wonderful  I think treating yourself with fancy sodas is an excellent way to celebrate the victory  Ice cream was my go to celebratory indulgence  especially in the early days  Oh baby  I'll wipe your tears away    You little bitch lol  Ohh gotcha     well I could see myself  in the right mood  reacting the same    Just blame it on the withdrawal  The silver lining in all this is that is a good fucking excuse for over reacting lol   LifeRing is another secular group  Good luck  I can relate  I have no real answer  But it would seem that you are bothered by your drinking or you would have never ended up here  Feel lucky that you are having this realization now when you can make a change  Many people never get that opportunity   that's nearly the only place I go  but there are like 400 meetings a week here  Let me know what part of town youre in when you come back again and I'll suggest some   I like that  But I bet he tried to smoke it  The fact he gets no H and is all sugar is my fault  WTF  HAHA   Now that's the kind of thing a clueless looser might say   Thanks so much man  Ya that is me exactly     I think ever since I started buying from a dispensary the weed has been too good     you can really feel it    and thats when it started going downhill   I'll keep in touch  Congrats on hitting day 7  Thats awesome  Hahahah My reasons    1  My physical health  In 2014 I was the lightest I'd been since 12 13 years old  180lbs  scary right    I've gained 50 lbs of that back  Alcohol ruined my sleep and caused me intestinal problems   not to mention going to the ER for an ulcer last June    2  My mental health  I had had long standing anxiety and depression issues and drinking certainly made that so much worse  Hungover anxiety at work hurting my performance  something I take huge pride in   being upset at losing my memory  being upset that I crashed early when friends were over   anxious that those around me could smell the alcohol on me  anxiety that I'd say something horrible and unreal to those I care about  Anxiety about not knowing what went on the night before   3  Social health  Never risking driving under the influence  Never making an ass of myself  Not being seen as the drunkard  When my friends have played card games   The Voting Game   even a month into sobriety I still win the cards voting along the lines of someone with an alcohol problem  It's eye opening to realize that's how my friends see me  It hurts but I need to see it as another reason to eradicate alcohol from my life   4  Breaking the genetic trend  My mom's mother drank herself to death  Mom told me stories of hiding alcohol around the house trained tank of the toilet  under the couch  in her bed  behind her bed  Fortunately my mom avoided alcoholism  despite being married to an alcoholic  My dad is in work release right now for a DUI  It's his second or third  Eight years ago in February we had an intervention for his weed and alcohol use  and he said he'd get better and go to classes AA and maybe it did help  for a short while  I know that even while he gave me the two and three year AA chips he wasn't being honest in his sobriety  Now multiple DUIs later  he says he's going to change  I want to trust but he needs to prove that he's helping himself   5  Being honest with myself and others  Like above  it means nothing if I told my amazing husband that I'd stop drinking  and not stop  or drink behind his back as I had in the past  Doing that was lying to myself  and worse  lying to my soul mate  I still can't believe the things that I've done and said to the person who is most deserving of my honesty and respect  He'll be going on trips away this month  and it would be the easy  but wrong road to drink while he's gone  It would be dishonest to him  and dishonest to myself  To grow and be the person I want to be I have to be honest  I will not drink today  nor any day again   6  There is no moderation for me  When I drank  there was no one or two  I'd like to myself and others saying that's all I wanted  But it would always become more  The rabid animal inside would just keep craving more and more until before I knew it I was waking up the next day  no idea what happened the night before  When my husband would say  okay  just weekends  it could never be just weekends  or just wine with dinner  It always had to be more  And that destroyed me inside and outside  Any permission is opening the door to me hurting myself and everyone I love   7  The best for last  my partner  My partner came from an abusive relationship  I vowed to be an awesome husband and show him what a better life could be like  I sure failed that in many occasions  I'm blessed to have someone who loves me  is willing to help me and be there for me  Someone who can hear me promise that I'd never do it again  and when I failed and did it again was willing to still stand by me and let me prove that that was the last time I'd hurt us both by drinking  That last time was 29 days ago  and I've never felt more confidence in myself that I'm done with alcohol for good  For myself  but also for the amazing fella who's willing to love me    I will not reset my badge  I will not be dishonest with myself or my loved ones  and I'm going to start respecting myself and my amazing spouse  I will not drink today   Edit for formatting cus I'm 100  mobile  I can't wait to hear the progress that comes with you giving up smoking   It is impressive that you kept everything together while smoking so much   so it'll be sweet to see your capabilities with a clear mind   You're as credible as timbf now    Lolol     Nobody with half a brain is going to take you kids seriously now  Ya man  if I had  50 and no food  I was more likely to buy  40 worth of weed and keep the  10 for more weed the next day  I laugh sometimes about "oh man it would be nice to buy x" and then I think "wow if I didn't smoke for a week I could buy it"   But then I would just go buy more  Vicious cycle  don't worry and don't let it get you down finish off 2017 pornfree  Not smoking causes us weed addicts anxiety   It is important to deal effectively with the anxiety   Your Dr can give you medical assistance or you can go the herbal route to help take the edge off   A mad33 gave excellent advice in cutting back  for awhile before you quit   It will make the withdrawals easier to handle   I would definitely use the 2 weeks your friend is on holidays as the time to cut back and quit   Get a wee bit of clean time under Your belt before subjecting your partner to the angst we all go through in dealing with withdrawals   We can do this  GREAT quote  My theme for this year is "do less  finish more " I am always overestimating what I can get done  and consequently have many unfinished projects and goals not reached  Time to make those incremental changes  Fantastic job on 2016  I really enjoy your posts  Thank you for your thoughts my fellow long winded pal  D Welcome  Facing reality is very difficult but it wasn't getting any better when you tried to escape it    I'll be two years sober in march and it continues to be the best decision I've ever made I wouldn't throw your lot in with those retards   We know how to make kool aid    If you wanna be a timbf fucktard  well  don't say I didn't warn you  I have had plenty of weird things in my vagina but not that    Yet    Congrats man  Keep the streak alive     No more fiends in 2017   Congratulations  I'm 26  so I can relate to your thoughts on your age  I'm so happy for you  Aww  guess timbf has a bitch after all    Assume the position  Isn't it great   I especially enjoy the added energy and general sense of peacefulness that sobriety is graciously giving to me   I've heard people ask  "What do you do for fun if you don't drink "  That always makes me smile   What don't I do for fun these days   I've rediscovered old hobbies  exercised more frequently  spent a lot more time with my family    just generally recovered my old zest for life   Wasted  hungover me wasn't doing any of these things  Congrats on your sobriety   I'll happily not drink with you tonight to celebrate the new year  Hello and Welcome  I've been where you're at I don't know what it is but when I would start drinking excessive the mental obsession of getting booze in me would trump everything  I started practicing a lot of lip service  Calling into work  making a lot of excuses and just being a rotten person  That is my experience  the muscle pain I've been told was from my lack of potassium  I used to get cramps really bad it hurt like hell  So alcohol wrecked me in so many ways and nearly cost my life a few times  This last time I fell off the physical pain from withdrawal became so bad and I couldn't stop on my own I had to go and detox and be under supervision  I just turned 37  I started drinking really heavy at 22  I don't regret what I went through it has led up to where I am today  I hope you find peace and there is a lot of help out there   Sleep will come  Music  good documentaries  etc  always kept me in a decent mood late night     No more fiends in 2017   Original post was deleted  buuut  may I ask why you say you feel like a dick drinking a soft drink in a bar  I'm sorry you have to hear lectures on moderation  I suppose I'm lucky that my friends understand wholly and support not drinking  Do folks you talk to not understand that for many  there isn't moderation  That it goes a lot further for us      Sorry  friend  I won't drink with you today  You are young  There is still time    Speaking of vaginas  I need to go shower and then go do important things   Dude you argued with not 1 two 2 not fucking 3 but 4 IV users now  AND NUMBER 3 was a fuckin biochem major     Youre a dumbass  You where saying fash was wasting so much    The only person wasting their drugs here was you heating that shit up and fucking up the potency  The only thing you dissolved by adding heat was filler     Sush sweetie  the adults are talking  It gets easier and easier  Keep strong  Keep focused  If you can be around loved ones who support your decision  If you can't  keep your mind occupied through reddit  movies  music  etc    Good luck  You have our support   Hahah He is busy with me right now  Go away  lol Yeah on second thought  I'll probably be avoiding that one haha  Thanks for the advice I can relate to just showering and having a vagina  but no important things     Bang out some pushups  You doing meetings     No more fiends in 2017   You can do it      There is hope  Right here   So far as I can tell more than ten folks who started a year ago have reported their success on SD in the last day  This is huge     This is exactly how I feel but I still don't know how to ditch the bud Thanks for your story   I remember your Sunday Share when you posted it   Awesome   The 'glass of scotch' is something                Same  it's a vicious cycle for sure  It's really scary  I just made a promise to myself that I would go to 3 meetings a week for all of January and will tell my therapist so she can keep me accountable  I don't have to share with the group  I just have to show up  This has nothing to do with tim dude youre a fucking dumbass idiot  everyone youve come into contact has told you that you are wrong  But it's ok Everyone else is wrong  the subreddit full of lifelong junkies are wrong     You are right  Yep forrrsure  I just came to see what was up and then I see it's just some fuckhead who refuses to admit hes a fucking idiot and then turns around calling everyone else names and telling them how right he is      Ohhhhh  I know the feeling all too well   Some people like fruit  especially bananas for the potassium   Small bites   Chew it up well   Lots of water   I like sparkling water   It helps  Also  I found that soups are easier to get down than solid food   Sorry  I don't know of any supplements that will help   I did read that probiotics help some people    There's no explaining to this dude  jesus fucking christ  Im running away lol I'm sorry  That sounds so hard  Thanks  I also forgot to add that I have my girlfriend with me as a strong support system  so that's great  I took about 3gs earlier to see how it would affect me  and it was just fine  I've had some periods of "weirdness" today along with my withdrawals  but I really think it's all just kratom withdrawals and side effects  I'll be tapering down to nothing within probably about a week  only because I don't want to quit cold turkey with all these weird withdrawal symptoms already a problem  Thanks again guys for the support  I'm pretty educated when it comes to all this  but I've just never heard of anyone having such severe symptoms when taking such relatively low moderate doses   Welcome  friend   Glad you are here   Staying sober has been the best gift that I have ever given myself   I'll gladly not drink with you today if that helps     It never happened to me  but I did have friends in grad school who described something like this  That said  it's probably best to go to a doctor if you're barfing when you eat  They'll have a much better idea of what could be plaguing your digestive system  Good for you  I'm also around  the same sober time  I just got out of treatment before Christmas and haven't been to any meetings also  I feel like I'm doing really well and that I don't need to go  I heard the 90 meeting in 90 days is really good to do  Maybe this is a good goal to set  For you and myself I also had a lot of pie  I don't even feel guilty    Your boy has already assumed a submissive position   https   www reddit com r cripplingalcoholism comments 5lfjw4 how to make a margarita dbvzcxc      Happy New Year to you as well   u seanomenon     Feeling grateful today  I have spent so many January 1sts in the past nursing atrocious  all day puking hangovers  it's so nice to bring in the new year feeling good  feeling thankful  You helped me out 5 years and 3 months ago now  THANK YOU  Hope this new year brings you happy adventures  peace and joy    3 Thank you man  Heading into day 6  Hoping I get rest tonight  Good shit happened today but the cold has me feeling like ass and cleaning everything behind me  I smoked daily for 20  years    The first three days will be the toughest   You'll likely be irritable and may have difficulty falling asleep      Try some Tylenol PM to help get your sleep patterns back on track   But only for a few days      You may experience a lack of appetite   For me that was good as I had become overweight   I found fruit and Greek yogurt were good and helped keep my energy up     Your dreams will likely go into overdrive after being suppressed for so long   Mine settled down after a few short weeks     Ultimately it felt real good to stop hurting myself    Good Story Telling  I felt like I was there  Happy NY to you also  Here is to a Sober and strong one  I like this perspective quite a bit    Okay  the above reads way cheesier than I intend  but an up vote seems inadequate      So   thanks for sharing  It's helped me to read and think about how I've been interacting with my own circus of late   I have had issues with my appetite the day s  after drinking heavily   I would not eat or could not because I too would bring the food back up   I've only had those experiences after drinking heavily  so I know that my issues were alcohol related  I woke up late but sober  went to lunch with 3 of my best friends  did laundry  went over to another friend's house to visit  watched Seahawks with a good friend and support system  swept my house  did yoga  dyed my hair  answered some messages I'd neglected  and called a friend in WA to wish him happy new year  It was a good day  Tomorrow I will go to work and go to AA  I have hope  which I haven't had since before thanksgiving  Will not drink with you all tonight     This is a terrific quote   Congrats on 473 days of sobriety  I will not drink with you today    Therapist  First time tomorrow  my wife is going with me to learn and try to understand what I'm going through with me  Despite never touching a drug in her life she's remarkably open to wanting to help and understand recovery  This is a seriously nice thread   I almost got married last night   and got proposed to again today   This explains a lot  Haha   What do I do for fun   I remember everything   I have to inventory the resentments I gather so I don't boil over which leads me to drunk  which leads me to jail  broke or even death  This process has helped my stress level tremendously along with meditation   All in a day's work  ya prick  Lots of truth here  Thanks  I have wake and baked daily for almost 20 years  Looking forward to a new chapter in life  Keep your vagina clean  It is what my mother always told me  And that is important  Don't underestimate yourself  I don't   But I definitely can't at 3  I just wanted to know where he ate ramen  Jesus Christ      Happy to say after 11 months clean it didn't even cross my mind    Skin of your teeth is an interesting phrase  this made me laugh  Thank you   Thank you for all your efforts and hard work    I smoked daily as if I needed to fill a void in my life  I waked and baked  smoked before every meal  smoked before bed  I was psychologically   addicted    It gets in the way of my career also  I quit for my health and future  It's not crack  but it was definitely something that I needed to stop depending on daily   Just fuckin with ya  Thank you so much for this   I am exactly the same   and am constantly searching this sub for people with similar experiences    I am a daily smoker  I own my own business and smoke before work every morning  I wake up  smoke and then do a ton of creative thinking  I'm about to start a project that I won a grant to do   ideas and writing that I did stoned  I am writing a novel  and it reads well even when I'm sober   So why am I here   On leaves and not petioles  One day I had the thought   why am I waiting for something terrible to happen  What if I hit someone while driving high  I don't drive totally stoned but definitely while feeling the after effects   Even if I don't get drug tested  I would never know if the weed impaired me  My girlfriend is a teacher and a drug dog barked at her car   I've never stored weed there  it could have been a total mistake   but ill never know  It could have been from me getting in after just smoking  Biggest reason of all is that I want to be a foster parent   and in my state even a small drug conviction will get you banned forever    Or maybe on a less visceral level I am wondering if I am meeting my potential  I've done so much stoned   what am I capable of when I'm sober    I am gearing up to quit on my birthday this January   I'm experimenting with days off  Its hard  I feel uninspired  lazy  angry and disengaged  I'm hoping it passes   I fear that my good ideas  critical thinking and optimism will wash away and I'll become an internet addicted zombie  With a double chin  Which  speaking of which   I could really use some of that loss of appetite that everyone talks about  I spent my day off weed binging on Christmas cookies   Anyway  I hope you keep writing because it really is helpful to hear your perspective  And would love advice on how to acheive the creativity  clarity of thought  emotional reasonace  and motivation that weed can provide without use of the substance  Best of luck  I'm sorry you are hurting  I've been having rough go of things these last few months and not using alcohol to escape has been challenging at times  Every morning  however  I am so glad that I didn't drink  The price of a few minutes an hour of escape just isn't worth the cost  Plus  it won't change the situation or make me feel any different   I guess this is  in part  to say you are not alone  I will not drink with you today   Nice job man   What's your plan  I'm in sign me up  Haha set up the block and wait for me  Pie  That's what was missing from Christmas dinner  Pie    I am totally making apple pie this week and I won't feel guilty about it either     Lol   so true  I'm glad I tapered off before quiting this time around  Finally did something fucking right    Why are you advocating active smoking on an addiction forum   The fundamental definition of addiction is the inability to moderate      99 99 percent of us cannot do what you do   Believe me  we've tried     I'll join you in going to AA tomorrow  Keep up the good work  Please don't  lol  Later gator  I think what frightened me the most about going to AA was the fact I would be making an undeniable statement that I had this disease and taking a concrete step toward sobriety  It made everything very real  And it ultimately saved my life   The people were overall very kind and welcoming to me  I would suggest that you stick with the women  especially at first  Not every man in the rooms can be trusted  Good luck    I don't need an excuse to quit and get rid of my PC  I just need to do it and want the change for myself   100   You are from his subreddit  here to defend him    I admire that  but I already destroyed your master    There isn't a defensible position here    Just doesn't exist  sorry bud     You can name call and be mad all you want but it doesn't change the facts    Grrrrr  right  Thanks    I can't have one either  It's either some or none  I'm choosing none    I'm happy to hear you are feeling great  2017 will be a great year  Drinking nightly from 24 31  I was able to graduate law school  pass the bar  run trials all while staying fit  dating often  purchasing materialistic trivial things  etc    You are your own man  but I warn you  it can catch up to you   I've posted my full story if you care to read it     Good luck and I wish you continued success   I will not drink today   Congrats   Do your best to separate the voices in your head  if you will   There's one that is committed to you  moving forward and getting better     and there's one that wants you dead   Try and remember which one is talking when you're contemplating doing something good for yourself  I like the idea of this subreddit being my sponsor  Thank you for the advice Thank you and good luck  Your little voice's echo is profound    Awesome to hear   Thank you  I've noticed distracting myself helps too  Sometimes if I wait long enough the urge will pass  Best of luck to you  No problem at all  glad to have helped  Glad you are here  sounds like you have support at home which helps  Yes  you can do this  I do it one day at a time and check in every morning and throughout the day   Yeah I have friends who drink more than me and eat like pigs  I don't get it  and it's very frustrating cause I do like food  I noticed the change in my appetite about 2 3 years ago so I was curious if my long going drinking habit was affecting it  Been meaning to see a doctor about it but my insurance isn't so great  drunk chess i like it horse to 3a  I can relate so much to this  Yesterday I tried an edible as well and it was an awful experience  Not to mention all that money wasted  It's kind of a good thing it was a bad experience   another bad habit avoided I suppose   I applaud you for playing that off like the joke of a remark it was  His though was that I had recently slipped binged drinking alone Dec 22 23 24  although I informed all necessary parties in my life and did not lie  Sign me up  Thanks    This would give me anxiety x1000  I commend your confidence   Thank you  I was hesitant to post this as tomorrow is day one   I am not an alcoholic  this I know  But I want to stop the daily couple of beers or couple glasses of wine  And I know I have to because I have gained so much weight because of drinking   The exceptions will be with my BFF as she is moving soon and we have to have our two girls nights before she leaves  Who knows when we will see each other again   Is that alright for this sub or do I have to quit permanently to be here  Habit definition  an acquired behavior pattern regularly followed until it has become almost involuntary   Yep that's what I was doing with alcohol also   New habit these days i'm happy with  5am starts when no one is up  hit the beach and back early hangover free is nice  Right the fact is that fucking heat isnt needed to dissolve sugar or heroin  If you want to dissolve more sugar heroin than you would heat up water and that would increase the fucking solubility       For fucks sake man    And seriously destroyed my master    lmfao who the fuck seriously talks like that lol  Never met you  have no idea who you are  but I'm thinking of you and praying for you  Be strong and know that you are stronger than this  There's a lot of folks here fighting the same battle  You have a pretty terrible attitude   Just because someone disagrees with you is no reason to make a bunch of other assumptions about who they are or fire off personal attacks   Be intellectually honest  what worked for you may not work for others  this is true of just about any method  and just because you didn't have a problem with a substance doesn't mean others won't   You are very excited about something that you feel finally worked for you  and that's great  but there's no reason to get so defensive   Kratom  like other replacement therapies  has had success for some people   Like all mind altering drugs it has also posed a problem for some people as well   It IS addictive and may lead to difficult withdrawals   It CAN also have other side effects  most notably a skin condition effecting the face which results in redness and dry patches similar to eczema   This is well known in Thailand where it's use is old news  having been an herbal remedy for a couple thousand years  and it's a condition that continues after use has stopped  perhaps permanently   Eventually a tolerance will build up  extract or not  that's basic biology   A drug is a drug  it will effect different people differently  and by definition will have side effects  that's how drugs work   While they may not have been an issue for you personally  virulently defending it as a perfect wonder drug just comes off like the potheads that insist weed is a perfectly harmless plant that has never harmed anyone   Taking any psychoactive substance has consequences  sometimes in the balance it is a benefit  sometimes not   Please don't neglect the rest of your recovery program and depend on kratom to magically fix your addiction  nothing can do that  only by working on ourselves can we stay clean long term   Good luck to you  I hope you have a successful recovery  Bottle of wine costs about the same with the same proof   There are parts of me that want to give up the booze  or at least learn to control it somewhat  but there is barely any incentive to do so   What are the reasons you might want to give up or control the booze  Is it just the near certainty of health problems later on  as you mentioned  or are there other reasons    I do have depression and anxiety  both of which I have managed for around 10 years now  Honest question  Was drinking one of the ways you managed that    I can't help but feel it would change the whole dynamic of my life   It is absolutely changing the whole dynamic of my life  some parts of this are challenging right now while other parts  the parts I choose to focus on these days  are wonderful  wonderful changes that make it worth it to me  I have experienced that empty feeling of not feeling quite myself  especially a week ago  but I'm developing a new normal for myself that I like more  I think it'll be a while before I can be around boozy gatherings with lots of people  Christmas was a challenge  so I spent NYE at home  What's working for me right now is taking a break from many things I would normally do  I spend a lot of time on here  which helps with the hours when I don't have other satisfying non drinking activities to distract me   In terms of abuse I inflicted on my body  I got away with a lot more 10 years ago than I do now  I know my drinking made that worse  10 years flew by  and what I wouldn't give to have made the changes I'm making now 10 years ago instead  But at the time  I didn't suffer as much because of it  And so it goes   Thank you for sharing your story with us  I wish you all the best  Thank you  I've looked up meetings so many times and chickened out  I'm really hoping I can get up the nerve tomorrow  It takes time but I promise it is worth it these difficult days are part of it  I've seen people almost fall apart after a year and live to tell about it  They will say that they are so happy that they stuck with it and another year elapses and another year and all the mental garbage and the gloomy days subside and everything is brilliant  I got a sponsor this time around and really started working the steps and not just riding the coat tails of the fellowship of AA  Don't get me wrong the fellowship and meetings are great for some people  but I am introverted so I needed a more personal approach  My sponsor gets me in the book and I work step 10 daily when I start getting out of sorts  This time around is different for me and much more fulfilling spiritually  I am of course more spiritual as well  Having kids would be rad I could definitely get a charge from them   I'm with you   Much simpler  And cheering on all the day 1s  You got this  I have to wait several hours before my stomach will let me eat after I wake up  Even then I still feel like I'm forcing myself to get it down  I should have mentioned I also smoke a pack a day so I know that definitely isn't helping either   Sign me up  the smoking will be fun  I hate smoking sanyhow  it's the drinking it will take some getting used to since it's been my "this makes me enjoy people" medicine for fifteen years  it will kick my climbing game into high gear though so that will make up for it There are people in all stages from complete abstinence to moderation to considering where they fall into the mix  All are welcome  You would be surprised how many people are here just reading   Hoping everything goes well for you  Man  I've been pretty out of the loop as of late  Weren't you like nearly homeless last I checked  Now you're living it up in NYC    Either way  hope this year goes better for you buddy  Actually  better for all of us  Cheers  Wow   I didn't mean to strike such a nerve within you that you would feel compelled to write about what you think I think even though I stated none of those things whatsoever   This sub isn't an appropriate place for you to post personal attacks  if you actively participated in this community you would know that but instead it seems you came here just to advocate for Kratom and you are now becoming angry that people aren't agreeing with you   You went to go as far as to say I am "what is wrong with people "  I would have to disagree with you there  I am advocating for a solution that doesn't require the use of a substance every day to feel well   I am not advocating maintenance of addiction to reduce it to an easily manageable malady but instead to solve it altogether which there are many ways to accomplish just that   I am not in a 12 step fellowship nor do I believe those are the only way   Rather  I consider the disease model of addiction to be the most explanatory which is why I consider things like methadone  suboxone  and kratom to be efficacious harm reducers but not solutions to addiction  Great post   I'm inspired by your story  Welcome    I found r stopdrinking helped me find what I wanted in IRL support  as well and being generally helpful    My binging ended up five days a week and passed out for the weekend  I never thought I was an alcoholic  but I tried 30 days booze free  After about two weeks I started to think 'what next ' The idea of going back to drinking appalling me so I kept going and never looked back    My life is beyond improved  it's simply new   It gets SO much better  You are probably gonna sleep a lot for the first 6 months and that's okay  You've got to be selfish  to an extent  in recovery  especailly in the beginning  I recommend NA and working the program as they tell you  It works  Stick around until the miracle happens     It did feel good  You absolutely can do this  I hope you make the choice to quit  There are several of us that have been in a similar situation  and we're here and we're sober  It's scary  especially at first  I've not gone all that long yet  but just know you're among friends that can relate to you   Cheapest wine around here besides Mad Dog or whatever its called is about  6  And it smells like wine whereas you may be able to hide the 4 loko smell   Thank you  I have to say I have been to an NA celebration  for my brother  and everyone was super super nice there  And I've been to a Naranon meeting as well  I think the most intimidating thing is probably the prospect of actually getting sober  Maybe the fear of meetings is really about that   This    Chronic  Progressive and Fatal   People disagreeing with you doesn't make them a troll  reasonable adults can disagree and not be an ass about it   Such an attitude does create some skepticism about your intentions though  if you were just trying to help people why would you be so defensive   Being honest and reasonable gets much better results  knee jerk run on sentences make it hard to take what you say seriously   Also presenting a solution  and then immediately offering places to buy said solution just looks bad and again is a red flag   Just my  02   Good luck with your recovery   Definitely  Congrats     Thanks for the proof BTW that people like you active addicts  are scared of kratom because you know it works and if used you have no excuse   Wow   I can probably only go to one meeting a week but I also see a therapist who can help fill the gaps hopefully   No headache  No unsettled stomach  No urge to vomit  No exhaustion  I'm not sure why I never tried this before  Again I know the feeling and I'm tired of this cycle   This has actually become a more recent issue for me and I know much more of a sign with MY body telling me "it's time to leave alcohol alone for good "   I don't know David Foster Wallace  but I sure do know Ted  9   I'll need to look up Wallace   Congratulations on your 2 years  Kratom never really worked for me   I found lope was the way to go   Dose first thing in the morning  again in the evening   I could sleep  I could eat   Perhaps I did it wrong with kratom  but for sure lope helped me Drinking heavily was always an appetite suppressant for myself    I would consult a Doctor nonetheless   I could barely walk and stayed in bed for two weeks    Seeing a Dr  won't hurt  we can't give medical advice  can you pull your appointment forward if you need to  Stay off the Internet if you can  Or channel your surfing to r stopdrinking   Don't be surprised if you need to eat sweet foods  There's a bunch of sugar in booze    You're not alone   Thank you for posting this  I don't know about you but by the time I had a few  my 'tracking' would start to decline  I wouldn't be able to remember if I tracked it or not  Happens to me at the track at the gym too  7 laps equals a mile  When I get to higher numbers  I start to think 'Was that lap 10 or 11 ' When I didn't know  I would always go with the lower number  I'm sure I ran way more than I thought  Imagine if I did this with a drinking app  Was that drink 4 or 5  Ah  no idea   I'll make it 4  Eek  My BAC would not be accurate   Either way  you're doing a good thing and I'm not drinking with you today   EXCUSE ME    I know you're grasping for straws here  as you have sunk your own image to hell  BUT YOU WILL NOT TRY AND CAST HOMOPHOBIA ON ME YOU PIECE OF SHIT    I love my gay brethren  and fuck you for trying to turn nothing into an issue you worthless cunt     SHAMEFULL THAT YOU MOD  R OPIATES YOU GODDAMNED TRASH  Honestly  if she's going to do one or the other  Kratom is the way to go  For me personally  I just don't want to be addicted to this stuff anymore  But was I fearful for my life  No  Just sick of feeling crappy  worrying about the potential ban  etc  The one thing you said that worries me a bit though is that she's 'nodding out'  That doesn't happen typically with Kratom  So I'd be concerned maybe there's something else going on  I have gotten really sleepy before from taking too much Kratom  but never nodding    All in all  if she's going to take Heroin  pills or Kratom  I'd say Kratom is her safest bet  Because I'm a drunken mess kept in reserve  Yep  I think you are right on the nose with that  When I really think about it I think I'm most afraid of really taking concrete steps and truly admitting to myself that it's a real problem  Thanks for the tip about the Womens meeting  I sort of had that feeling and I always feel most comfortable in the company of women so that might be best for the first meeting   Lotta people suffering over at   r quittingkratom  It reminds me too much of regular opiate withdrawal   If it's helping you get your life together  and you're okay with knowing there will be discomfort when you stop  then more power to you  So what is your plan of action   Ah  I see  I am pretty sure you live very close to me   Alternatively you could take up running  meditation  journaling  horse riding  yoga  swimming  painting  learn a language  volunteer at a homeless shelter  volunteer anywhere    If you're an alcoholic you shouldn't pick up  if you're not you don't need to pick up   You brought it up like it was a bad thing  Not me  A lot of people like it  So whats your problem  And I always love when they say I got many gay black Mexican friends  Never a  good sign  And enough with the swearing  They are incredibly intimidating for everyone before one attends  I was more nervous entering a meeting than I was a courtroom  more nervous appearing amongst fellow alcoholic than I was colleagues or judges  Just let the meeting know it is your first time and don't feel pressured to share  you can simply sit quiet and listen     The nerves subside quickly  Everyone there has experienced what you have  Everyone there is there for the same reason  You'll see people of all ages  races  sexes  etc   I go to AA as much as often now  I struggle with the religious aspects but that's okay  Trust that you'll be okay   Send her articles on substance abuse and the disease of alcoholism  The only way to get through is by education   I'm able to get up and walk  Hell I worked at the cafe as a waiter ok new years eve  Only thing that was wrong was I felt like I couldn't talk right  "Bread and butter" was coming out " fesh bed and budd" I barely introduced myself to tables cause just saying my name made me sound dumb  Not neccesarily stumbling on my feet  but my words  No one understands what I'm saying anymore I have to repeat everything  Is this normal  Oh  I know what that's like  I don't think about not drinking ever again  I can't  Maybe I'll be able to envision that or say that's my intention down the road  but if I dwell too much on that right now  I know that's a relapse recipe for me  Seriously  I think I've relapsed more times after grappling with the idea of not drinking ever again than any other trigger  So  as of right now  my goal is today  I also like the idea of milestones  The ones I'm looking forward to are 30 days and 90 days  I have every intention of going beyond 90  but focusing on finite goal is a sort of trick I'm playing on myself so I don't panic  so I can stay in the now  as counter intuitive as that might seem  I'm sure it works differently for others  And that's where we all start    You can do this   I talked to her and she was really upset  to the point where she said she was ready to say fuck off and send me the check for the support i've given thus far and cut me off from the life of the child completely and do it on her own  said she has the support and people she needs and she doesn't need me  she doesn't even consider the baby's need for me  then we talked the next day and she said she understood why I would want the test done but did not say she was going to do it  The tests available while the baby is inside her are intrusive and dangerous  i'm willing to wait 2 or 3 months to find out  there is one test available for pre birth thats not intrusive but it's way expensive   I'm scared also of having to deal with her for the next 18 years  I'm not afraid to be a dad  but scared of dealing with her and her family  i'm very confused  For the next couple of weeks   r cripplingalcoholism is participating in our

something like this  there were 2 possible outcomes   1  I don't like it and have a bad experience  bad situation  2  I like it and now need to fight a sobriety battle on two fronts  worse situation    Thankfully it ended up being scenario 1   I had anxious paranoid thoughts about all the things in my life that are hard and unpleasant for 4 hours  then passed out   No danger of me craving pot again       Still  the "screw it  do it" attitude I had a couple days back is troubling  and I need to be hyper vigilant going forward   Hope  https   www google com search q rhode island client safari hl

not to drink another drop of alcohol  When I first stopped drinking the thought of not drinking again was so very overwhelming but now it's a part of who I am  I can't imagine my life with alcohol in it  I always play the tape forward when taking a drink crosses my mind but it never ends well  I can control my drinking one day at a time   Well I've got that covered   Two months down and feeling awesome  Let's keep on keepin on   read up on this    https   en wikipedia org wiki Delirium tremens The need to worry is relative   Did she have a period of total sobriety from maintenance meds   If not  the transition from something like methadone suboxone to kratom may or may not be a positive thing  positive in that most people seem to have an easier time kicking kratom  negative in that kratom presents a lot of unknowns       If she has been sober from all opioids  it's probably best described as a relapse    She is not really sticking to NA guidelines if she's taking this stuff and still sharing at meetings etc   So there may be an element of deception there    Overall  I think kratom can be positive for users of hard opioids  but it presents its own unique set of problems  I want to become more social and increase my confidence with females  I've never had the balls to ask a girl out before and I want that to change this year  You can do it    And yep  I watched my mother die of lung cancer  It's a shitty  shitty  SHITTY way to go   Way to go  I love my AA meetings  I make it a point  as do others to welcome a newcomer  New people coming to meetings helps me  Please come in  Just adding  and it still was hard to quit smoking  even after that  Addiction is powerful  isn't it  It's not "his" subreddit  It's not "my" subreddit either  We don't own it and we don't control the people who post there       Now You've got me paranoid   haha  It has worked well for me so far  SD has been a great place to be when the urges get strong  Well I'd want her to not be on any of it   all it does is spiral down in 99 9  of cases  Don't think it's that  Other than being irritable I've been wondering why I can't speak correctly to anyone  Mornings seem to be okay and then after a few hours of work I seem okay  otherwise I feel like I'm walking in a haze  Since day 1  Props to you for being able to beat benzos  that's amazing  I'm amazed that you think that was easier than kratom withdrawal  Cold turkey can be rough  but tapering has been super easy as long as you have self control  I'm terrified of gaba like withdrawals  One time I had a small case of rebound anxiety from 2 days of high dose phenibut  Didn't hit me until 3 days later so I was really confused  Just had this constant feeling of impending doom in my guy  Horrible feeling  but only lasted a day  I would take cold turkey kratom days verses any more days like that  Nowadays if I take a high dose pgenibut  I taper down quickly the next 3 days or so  For example  if I take up to 8 grams throughout a day of phenibut  I'll taper the next days like 2 3g  1 6  1 1  0 7  0 3  To avoid any sort of hangover or rebound anxiety  Works like a charm  Gaba drugs aint no joke to fuck with    But yeah  it's hard for me to hate kratom too much to quit completely  I still enjoy it  and usually have good self control with drugs  I initially started using for chronic pain  but now I use recreationally  I know I'll be able to jump off after my taper relatively easy  but still think I'll use occasionally once I've had at least a month clean  Can't hate the drug when we're the ones who abuse it Wow  That's crazy  but I'm glad you're ok  We've got your back  Jesus  I can go to a corner store and pick up a full bottle of shit ass red wine for  3   I'm sorry  R alcoholism is a forum

But then it gets better  I experienced very strong physical cravings  white hot rage  tears  and everything in between  But if you can hang on for three days  getting through it a craving  an hour  a day at time  it gets better  I had feelings of lightheadedness and feeling mentally "fuzzy" as well  Paradoxically I felt short of breath  and found myself taking great gulps of air  breathing very deeply  when the cravings hit  I slept more than usual   Can't long to smoke while you're asleep   I went for long walks to keep moving   I quit in April    But you can do it  Three days of hell  for a lifetime of freedom  Hell  yeah   And everyone's different  it may not even be hell  You might only go through Heck      R alcoholism is a forum for discussion and support   Your post has been

 Go team  Glad you're here with us  Let us know if we can support you at all  Happy new year SM2L  You are a constant inspiration with your prolific online line support across so many subs    Thanks for your service   I am all in with this whole not drinking thing  Strength in Numbers  It's true  I'm a girl      If that helps   Welcome to your new life  You're most welcome my friend   http   www hartford gov   Not far at all      I got to the point of drinking half a litre of Vodka daily  It get's better but the amount you're consuming does need the aid of medical professionals  It also helps telling someone you love and trust    Thank you for your share  You will overcome this  You will get better  You will succeed  You will excel   I'm just cutting it out completely with some nic gum to help the craving  Only 2 pieces today  which doesnt even equal one dip   My cousin has really been pushing me to quit for the past couple years and I've been putting it off  but he told me If he catches me with a can I have to pay him  5    But honestly right now  I feel pretty good  Ultimately I made this decision for me  not because someone else wants me to  and I'm  sticking with it this time  unlike the umpteenth other times I've "Quit" Fuck you and fuck him  you threw your hat in with that dumbass earlier    So sorry he's become a pathetic hatemonger  but you're going to have to suck it up  Buttercup  or denounce him outright     No hedging your bets here  sweetheart  I will not drink with you tonight  Glad you're here  I'm really not in a position to say  I can tell you what happened for me     If you're worried call the doctors offuce and see if you need to bring your appointment forward  That's what I would do   I've been told I get "surly" when I drink  Great to hear  Well done   There's a lot of support and encouragement on this sub  I'm proud of you for simply reaching out  that's a really hard first step and you did it  I think you can take the next step  whatever that might be for you  as well  It gets easier  and you will not regret the decision to stop drinking  Hang in there  friend  I won't drink with you today  I would look into getting a court ordered paternity test if you want to be involved  Text her about this issue that way you have evidence she thinks your the father  It sure sneaks up when you expect it to be over  eh  That's what makes it rough for me  I still miss smoking sometimes  and I still get a craving  It passes    But to say once you've quit and you're glad  that you never wish for it again is wrong  and dismissing that is like overlooking an enemy  Acknowledging it can make it easier to face and defeat it    When I miss smoking  and I still do  despite that it's done nothing for me and killed my mother  I just honestly acknowledge that I do miss something that's bad for me  and that's that way it is  I miss it  it's bad for me  and I can't ever go back to it  Sort of like walking away from an abusive lover  Part of you can still love and miss how he  she  or smoking made you feel    I too miss those moments of solitude and decompression that smoking gave me  Funny  when you can't or don't smoke indoors  it really was a nice way to get a few moments of alone  I even miss the build up of craving and the release of it with that first long  slow  fulfilling drag    But  Life's better without  You know it  I know it  But it's okay to miss it  And just be aware that missing it will come up  long after you think you're over it     Fuck you  hate monger    You are an embarrassment and should not mod any subs    Go fuck yourself  I experienced that alcoholism is a progressive disease   It only gets worse   When my consequences were not yet convincing  I kept drinking until they were too painful to bear and I had to stop   Quitting before desparation is quite extraordinary   Beat wishes to you in being able to stop before your misery forces you to  I won't drink tonight with ya      Down about 10lbs here so far   Hoping to lose about 30 more  Uhh ohhh  This post is going to cause drama   I will  I appreciate the advice The subs have a long half life  You will feel worse soon  Take lots of showers and baths   That's what I was told too  This was an ice breaker for me  I'm gonna try to go as many days as possible  Use water and exercise once the nicotine out of your system man   Limit your coffee as well   Get through each bad moment because it gets better    For me  Moderation does not work and I have no use for it  I want all the Alcohol  That is why I rather have none of the Alcohol  That is why I blew a 10 month run and would have had a year today  But I learned tons and know it does not work for me   When I felt the same as you describe  I timidly crawled into an AA meeting and came out with hope   I haven't needed a drink since  even when my Dad died suddenly in 2014  I'm in  I will not drink with you tonight  Weed is just repressing your anxiety and loneliness  and I smoked daily for over 8 years for the same reason as you    Feeling a little lonely  Not for long  with the help of  20 and a few bong rips  After repressing emotions for so long  it's now difficult to deal with them sober  and I know that it will only get harder the longer I smoke  I'm on day 9 of not smoking now and it sucks  I feel anxious and depressed  and I know that one toke would take all these awful emotions away    But it's not worth it  My brain needs to rewire and learn to function without weed  Quitting sucks  but stay strong  There are so many benefits of quitting  You are not alone     I am just confused about why you're so angry about this  And also why you're arguing about it after saying that you haven't shot up in years  And why you've kept going after everyone has said that you're wrong  Why are you taking this so personally  And are you always so quick to anger  I'm honestly really baffled about how you can't have a civil conversation   Can you just talk to her and ask  Is this something you think she will be honest to you about  I understand your concern  I really do  Heroin is a SCARY thing  It terrifies me   u are an ungreatfull bastard  so go buy some surstrming  Man you like the word "Fuck" a lot  Check out a dictionary and learn a few more you are really showing yourself tonight  I will be fine going over this tomrw  You not so lucky  You have had multiple people tell you are wrong but you shout them down  make threats and swear  Grow up man  Talk like a civil human being  Go watch these on Netflix if you haven't  Black Mirror  The OA Narcos   Amazon Prime has 1 month free trials and you can get Amazon Video with that which has all kinds of great stuff too    A big congrats to all you guys   Tremendous accomplishment   I would love to hear how the year went for some of you guys  some of the highs and lows   And how you feel after completing such a long challenge   365 days is no joke  Nah  You can go fuck yourself   Timbf's a good man  Don't trash talk like you need to be cool to hang   And ate you really giving him shit for modding a community that I'd do close to this one  just with more random deaths   That ain't right  She quit cold turkey  Straight up had her last shot  and she was deep too  her highest being a gram and half a day  and stopped doing it  She never quit smoking weed though so there's always been that element but this Kratom stuff is certainly new  It wasn't buried beneath a bunch of old garbage or something   we're talking just on her bed on top we had 5 empty 1oz bags and then a few pre made capsule bags in 12  24  and 42 counts    Reading online it certainly seems like a major problem if she's doing as much as she is  I mean  this is just on her bed   I don't even want to think about how much empty bags are in her backpack that she freaks out about anytime someone just as much touches it  Thank you for plugging that subreddit  Sorry  CORROSIVEsprings  your post has

amount to take to help with WD      I've played the lope game unfortunately   It dries you out to nothing   IMO  health wise  you're wayyy better off taking 30g of kratom a day   I don't think that stuff should be used at all to get off kratom   You do not want to trade something that is some what "safe " even at large doses  with something that can end up killing you or destroying your heart      Who knows how it will affect your kratom tolerance if you go back   You might need to double your taper dose to get back to where you want to be   It has an extremely long half life     You gotta dump that stuff and not think about it again    Pay me  I could not imagine my life without drinking  it was part of my being   Today I can not imagine sacrificing the gifts of sobriety for whatever temporary relief or pleasure might be left in a bottle   Don't miss it  don't want it  and don't even think about it   My whole attitude has changed  I used Kratom to get off of heroin  It pulled me out  not the other way around  Just personal experience   Once I heard someone say  rock bottom is where you stop digging  I've always known that weed makes me numb to the world  and that's exactly why I used it  I end each month with less than  100 in my bank account because I've spent all of my disposable income on weed  I've known that weed was ruining my life for years    It causes me to want to sit at home alone  lose friends  not care about anything or anyone  just pass the time by getting high    Eventually I just got fed up  I'm tired of being this person  this person is not me  I've gone back and forth about quitting weed for YEARS  This is finally the time  I'm on day 9  and I feel awful  but I can't wait to be the person I want to be  I personally think social media is cancer   In the beginning  I think a lot of us take one hour at a time  Hang in there  Or saltlakrits    But that's delicious though    Yeah  I was thinking a meeting every day or even every other day would be hard  so that's a happy compromise for me  Good luck     We can do this  I too felt for a long time like drinking was a huge part of my social life  indeed   I have social anxiety so I was convinced I needed  alcohol in order to have friends     I never lost a job due to drinking  I never hurt anyone  I wasn't the "skid row" type drinking out of a paper bag on the street  so what was the problem   I agree with another commenter that "high functioning alcoholic" is a stage  not a type  20 years from now  if I'd kept drinking  what would it look like   I'm 29 now  and I quit because I could start to see that my "yets" were getting closer  I didn't have a DUI   yet  But I was starting to drive drunk a lot more  I didn't lose my job   yet  But I was calling out "sick"  drunk  a lot more  I didn't lose any friends yet  But I wasn't talking to them either  When I started blacking out more often and contemplating suicide almost every time I drank  I knew it was about time to stop    Whatever you decide to do   it's great that you're thinking critically about your drinking  I hope you find the answers you're looking for   I like it  I'm an aspiring writer struggling with bulimia as well so I can relate to this one  My favorite lines are "She is only killing herself" and  she savors the emptiness  The only thing that bothers me is the pluralism  I don't know if that's the term for it sorry  english lang was last year  in "the young  the young  old" I would add a "the" before old  Would just flow better  Overall  good work and I hope the best for you    Limit coffee or caffeine  Not much for coffee but ill have a red bull at work  My job is pretty physical so exercise isnt a problem    The toughest part for me is dealing with the anger and stress  Its perfect I have the next two days off so Ill be 3 days in by the time I go back to work   It already has   The problem isn't discussing Kratom because the majority of people here have probably taken it at some point and understand its potential use   It is often discussed here   The problem is that OP is advocating for the use of kratom and becoming angry at anyone whom dares to mention the potential negative consequences of taking it   They seem more like a shill for kratom than a person offering their experiences with the substance  it doesn't help that they offered to send purchase links via PM  DEFINITELY takes longer than 2 weeks  If you've been using it a while  I'm seriously just starting to feel like 90  to baseline at 64 days  I was really getting nervous a week ago that I'd never be the same person  Even though every week got a little better  I never fully felt like my old self  I still would get sad too easily and so unmotivated  I was using it for 4 5 years though  It's crazy shit  I promise myself I will NEVER be addicted to anything like that again  Even if I take something in the future  besides coffee  I'll never take something addicting daily  WDs suck so bad  That was a wake up call  I'm 100  certain moderation will not work for me  I know that once I have 3 or 4 drinks in me  that app will be thrown by the wayside  I don't even bother putting in food in MFP on the days that I drink  I doubt I will bother with this  It's a lot easier for me not to drink  Moderation sounds like torture in all honesty because the entire time I will be craving more   Thank you  Agreed  let's do this  Congrats on one year  Happy Re Birthday   Oh I'm sure but I do know that in the past she wasn't using heroin   no way   just based on attitude and living with her  But I will say that in the past couple months or so  especially  I've noticed that she's been a bit   off   which would coincide with her having this stuff as opposed to when she was acting more normal and had none of this stuff   So while it's possible she relapsed  said nothing to anyone and hid it very well  and then started taking very large amounts of kratom  I found 5 1oz bags on her bed   all empty  to get off of it   OR   she's taking it to get fucked up   Considering her behavior and weird vibes the past several weeks I'm leading more to the latter   Do I leave a comment here to check in for January  Good job man  It can be especially hard when the habit is so ingrained in your everyday life  Just remember that you knw exactly where smoking will take you  it wont be anything new  Knowing that will ease it and make the newfound sobriety a bit more interesting  Keep us posted    If I didn't just want to get out with my liquor I'd say something     I'll take liquor and some judgemental

is good   Don't hide from it   It is important  Your conclusion that you may have a problem with alcohol seems well supported   Fortunately  there is a solution and help is all around you   Best wishes to you in reaching out for it   All that is required is a small amount of honesty  openness and willingness  That's great that he wants to quit and that you want to support him  This has to come from him  though  That's the beginning and the key to a person's sobriety  Good luck Full support for the keeping a journal and cost benefit suggestions below   I've been mostly sober for 2 years and went on and back off in part because of anxiety and not having other ways to cope with them   Perhaps doing a few 30 days clean challenges and during those looking for other ways to deal with anxiety will help you gain some insight into whether or not you feel like you can have a healthy and sustainable long term relationship with alcohol   Kratom is a big part of why I have over 2 1 2 years off heroin  alcohol and all other drugs  It has definitely helped me save my life  I now have an apartment  2 cars  full time job  and actively participate in the community  Not to mention a wonderful family life and amazing girlfriend  To anyone who is passing judgment on responsible kratom use let's remember I once lived on the street and committed crime everyday as a way of life  And for those who say how addictive it is I haven't had any kratom in over 2 days and feel more withdrawals if I skip my morning coffee  My life is amazing today  Whatever helps anyone who used to live how I lived and doesn't live that life any more  I support whatever you're doing   I'm in  it was okay when I was younger but  it's time to stop   Welcome  From what I've read  you might want to also check out  r AlAnon  Al Anon is a long standing support organization for families and friends of alcoholics   I bet you don't feel like a loser today  neither do I  It feels pretty dam good to not be hungover today  I won't drink with you   I didn't really think of it that way but imagine it being very helpful  The habit is so ingrained I've woken up a few times this week and said "I won't smoke til the afternoon" and the next thing I know I've rolled one and it's ready to go  It's habit   That being said habit's can be broken  I'm glad you brought that up  I smoked some pot too  I felt guilty  It wasn't the idea when I decided to get sober  Al Anon is a great place for those of us who love an alcoholic s    Lots of great experience about how to be healthy ourselves and what helps and what hurts the alcoholic s  we love   It's a big step but you sound willing  Forever grateful of this subreddit  18 days clean today   Good luck friend  I'm the same boat  I read somewhere that the liver can heal fast but once it's really fucked up  there's nothing left to do  I may be wrong though  Alcohol can fuck up a liver really bad  With the Benzos  only the first week was really bad   and one week  you forget quickly   no matter how bad it was  Just lucky  because 75  of the  Benzo users have severe PAWS  and I was one of the 25        In addition  most people do not use Benzos for such a long time  But I don't like games of chance   And I don't like the Kratom game anymore    Feeling like a normal person that doesn't feel ashamed of himself  Same  I also feel like this stemmed from me not being my real self  not my best self  So I was attracting the wrong people  But how awesome it is that you recognize this and can turn things around  The ability to change is really motivating for me  Hope things are looking up   Happy new year  See you all on Stay Clean January  We're here  I promise  Now is the time   Get it straight you are so Fucked up that you do not remember i came to back up what she said    Haha whos the dumbass now    Thanks for being open about this  It's soooo hard when you have to pull that bandage back  A big part of it for me was also remembering things that I had allowed myself to bury under weed usage  Healing from this kind of childhood trauma is really a daily job  I wish you the best in this endeavor  Don't give up   Most of those people would complain from coffee WD  If you've ever had to deal with opiate WD you most likely won't have an issue  Almost all of these people have never had to go through opiate WD or any from a hard drug  We are right there with you  one day at a time   Also  if you feel an urge  craving or just mental distraction  try to remember that this mental condition is temporary and that you are able to wait for it to pass  I find your post so motivational  It's post like this that keep me going  Thank you  Love that quote  Taking it for my tool box  I won't drink with you today   Lope didn't help me but kratom did  Everyone is different  So real  Just remember that you don't have to dwell on a mistake just because you spent a lot of time making it  Upward and Onward   Checking in  Here's to another good month of sobriety  It's true for many  Know what's weird  You didn't drink and you're happily posting today  if you drank you would be posting w guilt and shame  I dunno why we drink we always regret it  it's illogical but really hard  Glad you didn't drink d00d This was beautiful to read  thank you  Welcome   There are tons of great resources on the info for the sub  great recommended reading also   A saying that I've grown to deeply appreciate  not sure of the original source   something along the lines of "there's nothing so bad that drinking can't make it worse"   Glad you're here  I just went no contact with my mother this week  It's been 10 years in the making  Tried threats  sit down meetings  going little contact but nothing worked  Finally decided to cut ties and let her figure it out on her own  I have enough going no on in my life without having to worry about hers too   Huh  I'm pretty sure somewhere a child is going hungry tonight  Two things I never waste  Booze and food  I've seen dirt poor  And I'm not OK with being an entitled ass because of that  I get dick pics on the daily      Attractive schlong  I'm in  This is my 4th Day One in 3 months  but I've re established what my goals are in life during the next year and this is only going to make all of them easier  I'm really feeling it right now  let's do this  I'm gonna start my detox off of Xanax next week  Scared shitless   Haven't had a puff of weed since I got hospitalized for my Xanax withdrawal  Been about 2 weeks  I totally identify with you  no desire to get high  but the boredom is fucking rough  Best advice I can give you is to fill up your time with other stuff  I've been watching a new TV show  spending time with my family  and focusing on work    Keep up the good work man  There's more to life than getting high  it's nice to finally be able to see that   It's always a good idea to redirect those "screw it" thoughts before they get out of hand but it sounds like you have a good handle on things  Especially since you're recognizing those thoughts for what they are  Some good things came out of this  and guess what  We made it through to the New Year without drinking  That is an accomplishment all on its own  Congratulations   Welcome   There are tons of great resources on the info for the sub  great recommended reading also   A saying that

That's what the drug literally does to our bains   It's not true   Just take it minute by minute man  Sign me up Raising my la Croix to you my friend  I won't drink with you tonight  Thank you left clique  this is helpful  Hi there   302 days ago  I was in the twenty a day club  My liver area hurt  I sweat constantly  and my life was such a mess  It took a DWI and the possibility of losing my family to jolt me out of it  It is hard at first  but you will be amazed how quickly your body heals  You can do this   Welcome back  I tested the waters after 10 months off and regret it  But I take what I learned to make a stronger run at never drinking again  I will not Drink with you   Hi and congrats   I have 47 days and totally understand your feeling  Just this week I avoided meetings  What has helped is to go to the meeting and be with others in recovery and to raise your hand and share what youve shared here  I have done exactly the same thing and have been stunned with the help I have received   The other thing that helped me was going to many many different types of meetings and groups  I live in NYC and am lucky this way so I understand it may be harder  Gettibg my butt in a chair and sharing for me is the most important  Trying out different types of meetings is the next most    Just my experience     I've made the mistake of thinking I could go back to casual use after 54 days clean   Almost 8 weeks in and I started it up again   thinking I could use 3x a week at most  Well like you'll find time and time again with people who think they can go back to limited use after abusing this substance   3 times a week turned into 4  then 5  then daily   then multiple times a day and I ended up back to where I started before my initial quit  Unfortunately my ego got in the way and I figured I "wasn't like everyone else"  and I could go back to sustainable usage   To my dismay   I am like everyone else and I got hard core addicted again  though fortunately my bender only lasted a month before I gave it up again  26 days today   Though you may truly be different and could manage casual use   I think the stats say otherwise and you should just go no contact on this substance like it's an emotionally physically abusive ex  P Hey  despite resetting your badge  drinking for a few days does not change what you've accomplished in your sobriety   Learn from your experience  becoming stronger so as to not let it happen again  and enjoy being sober again    Best of luck to you  Thanks  I feel like I take advantage of this thought too much though I guess  Like I will manipulate myself into ending up smoking every day again and haven't been able to stop that yet  it's a continuous cycle of stopping  wanting some and then smoking consistently again  And if I can't smoke weed it will be drinking  not to same extent  or smoking cigarettes    I'm trying to stop this feeling I get  but when I actually think about it it really doesn't even help and makes me emotionally less stable and able to deal with life  Works harder  relationships are harder  thinking is harder    but I'm numb so I don't care  Thanks for taking the time to respond   Appreciate the response  it's like it's too hard to even write down that I will because if I fail I have physical proof   I will not drink with you tonight   I like that line   "   missing out on the "fun" of drinking  I skipped drinking so I wouldn't miss out on the fun today "   Yes  a personal anecdote of an experience that didn't end well is evidence that the individual whom had the experience is just "scared of kratom" because they "know it works" and will no longer have an "excuse "  I am sure everyone on r quittingkratom is also just "scared of kratom " For me day 1 and 2 were the worst  I stayed busy  I filled every moment with activity so I wouldn't think about drinking  This sub was extremely helpful as well  After day 2 everything got better daily  There is a light at the end of that tunnel  I won't drink with you today   Minute by minute  hour by hour  day by day  week by week  month by month  It all adds up but it all starts with minute by minute   8 hours is a good start  Be strong  Keep it up  Keep your mind occupied  If you're not making over  10K per year gaming  just don't come back to it    unless it's co op on a simple  silly game with your nephew on the Playstation in the living room   I'm so proud of you for going  It was scary and overwhelming for me at first too    Ultimately sticking with AA was the single best decision of my life   Checking in  One step at a time No matter what I say you're going to try and come up with some rebuttal and wave your dick around  Agreed  I fucking hate what social media has become  No one is "waving their dick around" except you   You have been attacking anyone that replies to you that doesn't agree and or has an alternative experience to the one you have claimed to have  I hear ya man  I used for about 4yrs and at one point basically carried a big ass bag of it around everywhere I went and shoveled handfuls of the nasty shit in my mouth all day everyday  I was taking insane amounts the height of my addiction  I got so fed up with this shit a year ago that I said fuck it and quit everything    Adderal  pot  antidepressant  xanax  and pretty much booze too  The fact that kratom made me feel so gawd awful  gave me the motivation to quit everything  Managed to kick all the others but kratom keeps fucking with me  It's all out mental warfare to kick this plant but I'm determined this time to do it   Thank you  it definitely sometimes feels embarrassing to talk to people about as it has this stigma of not being so bad and there are all these other drugs out there which are much harder on your body withdrawal wise  I know something is wrong  at this point it's just a cycle of quitting and taking back up again  I just can't seem to find meaning in life without a substance  like alcohol  weed or even smoking cigarettes  I'm trying to get something that I can't ever reach and the constant anxiety surrounding it  especially since my partner is aware and actively wants me to stop  is exhausting   I am confident I can quit again but     like always within a month will always start back up or try manipulate my way into smoking  it's fucked   Exactly   I did whatever it took to stay calm that first day   ate whatever I felt like  took 3 showers  played video games  whatever   You've got this  Happy New Year  MWR  2016 had it's share of lows for me  but there was a lot of good stuff too  I learned that I could do something that I didn't believe I could do  I haven't felt confidence in myself like this in a long time  it feels really good  Looking forward to the year ahead  and spending time with everyone here at SD    Joining the day 1 January 1 crowd today  Last night I discovered at 47 peer pressure still works  With friends  safe place  but I was not supposed to drink and I did  Today I was sober though     Hope you're doing better  Take care of yourself   Come find us in the chat  There are usually people around to hang with  There is a link on the sidebar   Welcome  I can totally relate to your post   It is so NOT worth it  anxiety and feelings of hopelessness    Cheers to us refusing to give up  Extracts don' defeat the purpose of using kratom that is hyperbolic  UEI  and the OPMS shit  Sure  Fuck that shit  But extracts are just like cannabis concentrates  Not for everyone  and can have a negative impact on tolerance  but just like normal kratom  the negative impacts will be a result of abuse and not proper use    I take extract enhance blends  that I make and sell  every day  Because there is extract in it  i never have had to up my dose  I take 3 5 grams and that's it    Not everyone can gulp down 10 grams of kratom without experiencing stomach discomfort or vomiting  Extract can seriously help those in need       Yay         Wow  I don't believe the "coincidence"   I started at age 13 and drank alcoholically for 30 years to age 43   13 years ago tonight I was getting arrested   I came home and drank into Jan 2  so Jan 3 is my sobriety date   I went to AA  followed directions and haven't had a drink since   Amazingly  I haven't had a troubling thought about drinking after that first year   If I can do it  I am pretty sure you can too as well as just about anyone else who has a sincere desire to stop   Get this first 24 hours under your belt and I'll work hard to do the same  Wouldn't it be better to get real girls and have real sex  I will be finishing one year without fapping tomorrow and it's awesome  What I am now working on is quitting porn  On the same timeline brother Welcome ThreeFistsCompromise   I'm not drinking with you tonight    Awesome  Great work  As others said  Al anon can be a great resource    This might not be what your looking for but I asked my wife what she did to support me when I got sober  we had only been dating for 3 months when I got siber   We used to drink a lot together     I changed a lot of my life style  There's no alcohol in the house    I stopped drinking mostly  And I never drank around you  Especially when you first got sober    I made it clear that if there was ever a situation that you didn't want to be in  we could just leave  no questions asked    I tried not to be judgmental    Encouraged anything that you thought aided in your sobriety  Like AA    An open line of communication about alcohol    Those are her words  I'm sure if you'd like  she could talk to you about it    Great post   Glad you made the transition past being a lurker    I genuinely enjoyed your story     Keep posting  would love to see your progress  Would be awesome to see how you're doing after your first full day  or even a few days from now   I'll keep my eye out for you   u love of hockey    Got offered edibles from my old hook up  Easily turned them down  He congratulated me on being clean for a year  Give the account to me    s    Though seriously  good luck man  I have quit many times before  my issue is starting up for "just a couple joints" one night and starting every day again  The first week will suck  but then it starts lifting and everything feels easier and you feel happier  but you also think "I feel so good would be awesome to have a smoke"  I try to just sleep a lot when I quit and read or watch tv  I am usually irritable and down  Every time I get caught at about the month mark with this "would be awesome to have a few joints" feeling which progresses to bongs everyday   When you're smoking it it feels normal to smoke everyday  being straight feels wrong  This does change  don't doubt that  I wish you well   As a camp counselor when I was about 15  a kid told me she wanted to have spots on her face just like me when she grew up  Don't read too much into it   This is wonderful advice  I'll just add that sometimes even a day is a bit much to chew  Sometimes it's just an hour or two that I need to focus on   That's so awesome  Happy new year     It's like a demon  But thankfully it gets conquered everyday by people with will power and patience   The hurdle of not drinking with your friends is simple  If they care their not your friends  Getting sober is for you  Only  If your coming here you might be an alcoholic cause you can't control your drinking  you go on a bender fuck up and fear keeps you sober  I would recommend a meeting of alcohols anonymous and look at step 1     Congrats on your First Week   The first few are really tough but I know you're tougher   Keep fighting the good fight and Happy New Year    you'll have to eventually anyway  Kratom will stop working  I don't see why or how this is true  Kratom should never stop working if someone uses once or twice a week  The problem is  only using once or twice a week and never doing more than that takes a lot more willpower than most of us have  There's a lot to unwind there  but one small thing is dealing with parties   A huge weight was lifted off my shoulders when I started planning for social events   I thought about what I would say if offered a drink   I made plans to leave if I felt weird   And most importantly  if I felt at all weird i skipped it   And the funny thing was that as I started telling people I wasn't drinking  it got easier   I had some accountability  people were supportive and I relaxed   Give it a shot   I was uncomfortable not drinking when I was planning my next relapse  because I worried that people might "hold me to it "  I know now I was always planning to relapse     It can be done  I am much more relaxed in social settings now and life is going on nicely without booze     I won't drink with you today  I've never had a problem with weed  I'm in my 30's and I've probably used it    2 dozen times my whole life  and I live in CO  I consider it a better option in every way compared to booze  Honestly  if my relationship with booze were the same as it is with weed I would never think about "quitting" because I really never really feel like I've "started"   He says if I leave him that I'm giving up on us  You aren't a prick  the chemicals in your brain have rewired so you aren't able to make a decision about this in the same way you could if you weren't smoking  I think insight into your own mind helps  write down how you feel when you are feeling crap  and remember you are feeling this way because you take drugs every day  It feels normal to take drugs everyday  but it's not  Once you get past the hard part this will be clear  Be kind to yourself   Aw  mommy didn't bring you the right sammich  How about get off your ass and make her one  In a very very similar situation myself  Also engaged and having the same internal battle regarding my father's presence in my life  I recently blocked him on my phone for a week or so as a trial run  basically just to get through the holidays without his emotional turmoil    While every situation is different and this certainly will not work for everyone  my personal approach has been to reinforce good behavior and to "cut ties" when he is exhibiting bad behavior    I would not recommend telling your mother you are cutting ties or distancing yourself  If it just happens "naturally"  will probably save you a very upsetting and unproductive conversation if you had confronted her   Great response man  I think you have a level head about it and are much more mature than I was when I went through that ordeal  18 21   Your goal of not using this as a permanent solution is spot on  When I started my meds I believed that it was "the solution" to my problems  And after the pills made life worse  I decided that weed was the solution  I've quit before and my life got back on track and my issues pretty much disappeared  But the sweet herb pulled me back in after a trip out to Colorado to see family and it led to me being dependent on it again even though I knew I was better off without it deep down    I guess that's addiction  I'm on day 4 now of quitting and I already feel my homeostasis coming back with exercise  meditation  stretching  reading and playing music  When I get stoned I don't get any dopamine from those activities  and they don't help as much  When I'm sober  they give me the happy focus chemicals I need help me center myself when I start losing my direction  I've also found that I can get the adderall effect from a simple double shot espresso  I like to think that the coffee bean is more natural than amphetamines  and I'm able to utilize it on an "as needed" basis  I think we've got similar stories and it's great to feel like I'm not alone in this  I bet there are tons going through the same thing      I especially enjoy the added energy and general sense of peacefulness that sobriety is graciously giving to me   Oh man  that sounds amazing    yes  please  I am looking forward to that   Well said  I can be a grade A shit talker  but never violent  except occasionally to doors  I'm happy for you and your great day as well      That's awesome   Hey  man   I'm struggling too   You aren't gone  You're right here  Just like me   You posted here  That isn't a small thing  That's a start  Starts are the hardest thing   Change isn't easy  This new start will take you some place  You'll make new starts after that  You're always welcome here   Drinking is a habit because it works  You have a reason or a need to drink   There's another path to what you need  A different way to be safe or happy or connected or excited or whatever you're looking for    And that way won't kill you  And it won't make you hate yourself  And it won't leave you a broken mess every day   You started  You'll find it  You started at thinking about killing yourself and found your way here to ask for help   I'm already proud of you  Reading "This Naked Mind" has really helped me change a lot of my thinking about alcohol    that sentence came out of that new line of thinking  Still a work in progress  definitely  but    so far  I haven't regretted  not  drinking      I agree  but in my  3 weeks of experience of being clean  the mental part is easier to manage   There are supplements you can take and things you can do to help   You can forget about the depression and cravings     With the early physical WD stage  you're just there for the beating   If you're kicking bad  haven't slept in a 4 straight days  there isn't anything that is going to help other than another opioid     The first part of quitting is breaking the habit   The physical withdrawal symptoms are what keeps people using daily   Breaking that pattern of daily use  and more importantly  knowing it can be broken  is a huge step in the right direction      I used stuff for over 6 years  never once clean for 24 hours   I thought it was going to be terrible   I was terrified   It ended up not being so bad   Maybe I got lucky   Maybe I expected worse   But it is easier to sell someone on a week than saying you're pretty fucked for 30 60 days   No one knows how bad their WDs will be until they try and get to a certain point     I did ok today  I ran my fingers along the healing skin toward the evening which I could have limited had I reapplied lotion  I didn't worsen it  though  No new damage but it could have happened    I was just fortunate  Man that sucks  I had an old guy tell me  If I don't get up off my dead lazy ass and go enjoy life and stop dragging around my alcoholism with me  It's nobodies fault but my own  And you know he's right  See what y can add to the stream of life Stay strong  First 3 days are the worst   We got this  Nice  Keep it up  One day at a time  There have been a lot of alcoholics in my life    My father is an alcoholic  he has been for about 30 years  I cut off our relationship five years ago when I realized he was never going to change because he didn't see anything wrong with his alcoholism and drug abuse  Hardcore denial    My mother in law has been in AA for eight years  She hasn't touched a drop of liquor in that time  but she substituted a painkiller addiction  That got rid of the violence  but now she's totally vacant when high  and emotionally aggressive conniving when searching for drugs  My husband only talks to her a few times a year because it's painful to interact with her through her drug abuse    My maternal grandmother joined AA in the 1980s and she has kept showing up  She's still not perfectly sober  she's never been able to go a whole year without drinking  Earlier this year  I picked her up from a public park where she was drunk as a skunk after drinking a bottle of schnapps    but those incidents are far between and she keeps going back to AA  It's a lot easier to handle because she's trying hard to battle her demons    So it's definitely not easy  And it's worse when they won't admit they have a problem  The hard part is that they'll never get there until they're ready to  The only thing you can do is establish healthy boundaries to protect yourself   You got this  Are you checking out local AA meetings  Rad  glad to hear your on your last bag  Don't let yourself down and buy another  It's crazy to think we work a job we hate  just to get money so we can get stoned and enjoy music when there's an entire industry of dedicated musicians that are making a living off of playing music whether they smoke or not  I really want to get my priorities straight and start pursuing music because it is my only true passion  No more working to buy weed  I need to start working to satisfy my heart It really doesn't matter if you consider yourself an alcoholic  problem drinker  or a Drunky McDrunkface  The label or severity is not so important  What it important is the desire to stop drinking and it looks like you have that   I tried many times to stop  I would go days or weeks  But I always set a limit  I'd tell myself that I wouldnt drink for two weeks  But at midnight at the end of the second week  I'd have a beer in hand  counting down the seconds    When I got sober I didn't set a time  I decided it was time for a change and that's what this requires  a life style change  But it's a pretty simple one    It's not like going to the gym where you have to drag yourself there  All you have to do is literally not drink  Willingness to do whatever it takes is all it takes   The rest of the life style sort of comes with it  And it's all good  even what seems like bad  Like losing drinking buddies who you thought were friends but really just want someone to drink with  You'll learn who your real friends are   I just celebrated 18 months of sobriety  I stopped counting days after 6 months  My life has completely chabged  I mean 180 turn around in that time  You can look at my post from yesterday if you'd like   Stopping drinking is the most important thing I've ever done  I would be digging myself into an early grave if I didn't stop  I'm sure of it   How old are you  And why did you post this here  And maybe a homeless person would have eaten that instead of you throwing it away   If your an alcoholic you have three ends if you keep drinking  Wet brain  dead  prison mental institution  To drink is to die brother You'll always have support here  Everyone is great   Have you considered what options are available to you  Do you know if you'd like to do a set program  and if so  do you now what is available in your area  Or if you'd prefer something self directed  If so  Annie Grace's book 'This Naked Mind' is available free of charge on this sub   Either way I would get to the doctor or the ER ASAP first of all   20 beers a day is enough to cause some dangerous withdrawal symptoms  You can talk about options for initial detox  then think about how you want to tackle ongoing recovery  There's heaps of options for this and there will be a way that suits you    There is no problem so bad that alcohol can't make it worse   It might feel hopeless now but everyone that gets sober has felt this way at some point  There is hope for you even though you can't see it  The alcohol is talking right now   once you take away the alcohol  the world will be a much brighter place    Good luck and stay in touch  Being optimistic is really a double edged sword    It does show incredible strength on your part that you are willing to be helpful while still distancing yourself  That is a very healthy outlook on the situation and I applaud you for it   I was an angry drunk  more often than not   I never found anything that helped it  it would just happen and I was so so mean   Honestly I think you're best bet is to try not to black out or know what's going to happen if you do  limit your contact with people if you want to get that shit faced   It's hard not to cross the line  but you can still get pretty schnockered without blacking out  takes practice I suppose  What the fuck are you talking about I was on the road to killing myself or being in prison for the rest of my life on Roxi's and Methadone  I found out about Kratom and used it as well as Cannabis to finally stay off pharmaceutical opiates for what I'm confident will be forever  unless obviously a major trauma event happened   I still do take it daily and have not chosen to quit altogether  but I can take tapered T breaks  I don't abuse it because I can't just take what I need  I'm not and never would go stealing for it  I can last over a month on less than  100  I can do things I can't with opiates   I can quit  but it curbs my cravings like Methadone and works for my little moderate pain  that Ibuprofen or OTC medications truly do not  I ended up in it all because of a legitimate prescription when I was 14 and it went downhill quick  I live in Florida and if you do too you know how cheap plentiful it was in 2008 2012   It's definitely not a solution and by no means a cure  but it can help what seems to as much as Methadone and Suboxone which are so much more toxic  Like anything  daily use may cause addiction and WILL cause physical dependency  Tapered T breaks should be taken with all drugs  but if you by chance can't  unlike Methadone or Suboxone you're not going to have the truly  crushing  depression  severity of RLS  pain  shitting yourself and puking  You're not going to overdose and die from it  All the janky packaging in head shops and OPMS and all those bullshit companies  yeah they're not cool  But legitimate vendors who truly have knowledge on herbal supplements are just fine  If you're just abusing opiates to get high  it may be not be for you but by all means is still worth a shot  If you're abusing them because you're also prescribed them and need pain management  you have a good chance of it benefitting you  If you are going to go the suboxone mmt route then Kratom is worth a try  Of course quitting substances all together is the best thing you can do  but this is more for the ones who still struggle with depression  cravings  occasional use  etc  and aren't against trying another option  Even home made 4 5x extract blends are great because it got me off 140mg Methadone dose  It shouldn't be used as a crutch and it needs to be understood  but to not realize the harm reduction in it compared to what Big Pharma has out  you're blind    I read 3oz Maple Syrup    now I can't stop throwing up everywhere  Thanks op I don't think anyone likes to think of themselves as an alcoholic   in fact I think everyone here tried to negotiate the hell out of not being one  Anything but that    But seriously  I recognize a lot of myself in your post   I couldn't bring myself to discuss it with my SO either  because that would be 1  acknowledging a real problem and thus 2  I would have to do something about it    I went back and forth a lot  am I or am I not an alcoholic  should I drink tonight or not   and frankly wasted a lot of time  and endured more consequences   but that was the path I chose to take     Not surprisingly when I finally did accept that I was an alcoholic  whatever that means  and did come clean with my husband  I was finally able to stop  and everything got a lot easier   And for what it's worth  even when I admitted to my most hateful  humiliating  horrible secret and how much I had been struggling  I found that in that moment  I actually  earned  his respect  He really had no idea what I was going through  still doesn't to some extent     He was sad that I had kept him in the dark  that I had struggled alone  that I didn't trust him enough to be open with him      In addition to this sub  I also found the recovery podcasts like The Bubble Hour  hugely helpful     Hang in there    Sign me up I will not drink with any of you tonight  Happy New Year   It's definitely not a panacea for addiction   You had me there  Congratulations and happy new years   NICE  Only 332 more days for mine      Congratulations  The importance of perspective and self care are things of which I feel many people  myself included   need to be reminded   In one of your replies  you said something that reminded me of Gloria Anzalda's  Borderlands La Frontera   she describes the importance of looking yourself in the eye  even when you don't recognize or are afraid of your reflection  Your internal Shadow Beast is a part of you  and is a part of your own power and efficacy  Self knowledge  assuming all the parts of who you are  embracing the parts of yourself  or reframing them  in productive ways that don't necessarily correspond to what other people society expect from you are all ideas that help me remember that I was made for a purpose  that I am part of a greater plan  There is power in naming yourself an alcoholic  because once you look your Shadow Beast in the eye  that is when you can more authentically engage in the world around you  Goodness knows I would want to tell my 12th grade self that    it would have saved me from a lot of hiding and would have made me find my own power over the people who only see its monstrosity a lot sooner  Let me guess    It was a shitty car to begin with and you have no insurance   Who cares you would have lost that job anyway   You would have found a reason to     Now drink   Bye fam   I'm a Leo      Astrology isn't real   I was ok when it was just a Friday  or Saturday drinking    Some are saying that it's ok to drink once in a while now  But I was so much better when I didn't drink at all   That's what's up man  I think we can both do it I completely agree  I live in SE WI and have family in the central part of the state  Even though the drinking cultures are different  the common denominator in most activities is alcohol  How did you stop drinking  Gotcha  Ill keep an eye out for that  Im a little jittery to begin with so I might have to cut it out  This is the first time quitting that ive actually felt confident about it  Every other time was well ill try and see how it goes   My 2016 sounds a lot like yours   I was thinking this morning  well  I guess it worked out  because all those relapses were the opportunity to get all of my tools in order  but they seem to be working pretty well now   Here's to running in 2017  Thank you  Oh sorry next time we will provide caviar and lobster    Get out of here you prick  I know what you mean  every so often my brain is racing with thoughts of how to get some  how I could hide it etc  it helps to know someone else is going through this too   Even if it's internet comrades  it's nice to know others exist     I was doing pretty good recently and had a relapse  There's always the "I was better off before that PMO" feeling   Good for you  fam  Have a good day tomorrow  You deserve it  When we was young we would get that canned ham mixed with potatoes   you know what we were grateful at least there was something on the plate Since I quit drinking  I've smoked a few cigarettes here and there which I was not happy about   I'm trying not to get caught up in perfectionism  while simultaneously not totally going of the rails either    Priority one is not drinking   that's my manta at the moment   Very minimal research done at all but I think OP is saying he took 30 mg of Immodium and not the Loperamide  I'm currently at day 15 of my C T off a 30g day for 6 months habit  In 30mg of Immodium there is only 4mg of Loperamide  I have taken 30mg of Immodium on days 4 7 9 14 and 15 and I did not feel like I was megadosing  Also at that dose I am almost positive that it's not prolonging my withdrawals as I haven't noticed a change from taking it  However I don't see the point at all of taking the two together  Please correct me if I'm wrong and 30mgs of Immodium is megadosing as I'll immediately abandon doing that  Not sure why I needed to remind myself why I stopped in the first place but here I am anyway  Could have been a lot worse as things go   Thank you  Two years of pretty consistent scrutiny for being a vegetarian has prepared me for this  Since you mention English  Oversee means to watch supervise  like a boss oversees their employees  The word you're looking for is overlook  This makes me really happy  Sending warm  sober 2017 wishes your way  Good luck  You moved to a place that when I visited it briefly  I was shocked at the overwhelming presence of cigarettes and wine as the national raison d'tre  No I don't believe I'm addicted  I was just curious what the far side looked like  I wish you all the very best in overcoming the addiction and hopefully one day being able to balance it out equally     If not  there is plenty of life outside gaming  getting addicted to sports is great way and you can do it with friends  You're on for 92 days according to the flair  you're doing great    I'd definitely recommend detox and rehab if you have the insurance to do it  I know you may have life committments but a lot of people I've dealt with in recovery lost their job relationships etc because they were getting high  Physical withdrawas are bad but the mental craving is still there  and while a week is phenomenal  when I would try to be clean at home the fact that I had been doing heroin for a couple years and opiates even longer made it that I would go back to my old habits and get high  I needed to re learn how to live without drugs and in my eyes the best thing for rehab for me was giving me time away from the drug in s safe environment  The comfort meds worked wonders along with the suboxone so that you don't feel too bad at all   In terms of easing wd at home  this may sound stupid but I would take hot baths and lay my legs out because the rls always got to me and the hot water seemed to really help that  I would then read in the bath to try to divert my attention and focus on something else  Listen to me you need to get married to this broad  Who cares if she's a sloot that's hot  She's been around   so what    tell her to take a shower and you're good to go  Day one for me as well  Congrats on the first 8 hours  Wishing you luck on the rest of day 1 and on your day two  You've got this  So do I have a problem  I drink when because at the time I tell myself it's ok  but then regret it after   That worked for you  and I'm glad it worked out that way  However  alcoholics aren't always that nice  especially when it comes to discussing their drinking problem  I know I always felt guilty  like I was walking on eggshells  whenever I tried to bring up drinking around my ex  He was very   like he did NOT want to talk about it  He didn't want to talk about it with me  let alone anyone else  That is quite a lot    It's great you noticed it as a problem and are doing something to combat it     I wish you the best for this new year McDonald's is not that bad dude  That shit is damn good compared to what a lot of CAs eat  Fuck I don't even have food today because I celebrated yesterday by eating today's food too  Meaning 3 packs of ramen  I'd straight up devour McDs man be thankful  AA does not explicitly recquire a belief in God  only a "higher power"  It can be literally anything except yourself  I'm agnostic and go to AA type meetings regularly and it doesn't feel too religious imo  I would at least try AA and  if you don't like it  then try a different group  sign me up starting over  You're on 1 day  you can totally do this  I believe in you  Woah   this Wellness plan worksheet is perfect for a self improvement nerd like me  Thanks VE  Congratulations  Great post  thank you  hahahha that wa funny Thanks  I think I have all the proof I need at this point and know that I am better off when not drinking  Many of us here will have heard all of this before from alcoholics in our lives  They are consummate liars and manipulators  They will always try and turn the blame away from themselves and onto someone else   often you or anyone else close  They will rationalise their drinking   seizures  etc   and say they are 'controlling' their drinking   Most of all they are constantly lying to themselves  After 2 years trying to help a close friend and neighbour  I realised it was destroying my life and I've opted out of being his shoulder to cry on  listener to all his self hate and anger at the world and people around him  anger at everything apart from the one thing they should be angry at   their drink addiction   You say he says if you leave him that YOU are giving up  Let's be honest here  he gave up a long long time ago  Your relationship is way down his list of priorities right now and all you are is a companion on his journey into oblivion   You have to get out of this situation now because the longer you hang around the longer it will take for him to accept he has   and he is   the problem   Will he do anything about it  That is entirely down to him  Nothing you can do or say will make him deal with it  I wish I could tell you the magic words or spell to make an alcoholic face up and start dealing with their addiction but  it doesn't exist   If you leave will he get better  Impossible to say  It's 50 50 at best but if you stay you'll just get dragged down with him for years until he either gets worse or finally get help and recovers   You're not giving up on your relationship but you must give up on him until he gets himself sorted   I used alcohol to numb me from all of my feelings  Very high functioning for the most part but it was slowing get worse  I am a stubborn sob and just made up my mind that I was done    It's been a rough road  Having to face emotions instead of drink has been the toughest  I found a therapist that I like and that has really helped    If YOU think that you should quit  then go ahead and do it  Challenge yourself to see how long you can go without a drink  Don't think about "forever"  that is difficult for anyone  1 day at a time  as the saying goes   With the onset of speech problems I would be concerned about something neurologically going on  I think it warrants a doctor visit sooner rather than later    Not to scare you  but slurred speech and inability to get words out can be symptoms of a stroke   Wow  this is powerful  I'm so glad you made it through that  Happy 2017  Admitting you have a problem is just about the hardest part  The next hardest is taking the first step to fixing the problem  Hope to see you stick around  we are all in this fight together    use it as a way to run from every single problem that arises in my life to the point where I become completely dependent on the feeling of gaming in order to get me through the day    This is never a good thing  when I used to get even mildly upset and used to be pretty depressed  I slept through many days of my life without realising  This sounds fairly similar to you  8 days is strong  it takes 3 months to cultivate a habit  I think  You can do this man   Same  Growing up  it was always around at parties  as teens my brother grew it  I've always been able to get it and there's some here at my cabin now  It just doesn't occur to me to use it or  on the rare occasion that I do  it's like another 6 months or a year before I do again  Ah  if only my favorite red wine were like that   Isn't waking up without anxiety about the previous night fabulous   I put away my Christmas decorations  had brunch with a friend  amidst quite a few hungover looking folks   went to the gym  tried to get a pedi  every salon I tried was closed  and finished out the day with a short run  I really  really love and hold dear my sobriety  I've dated some straight up whores before  Honestly not too fun at all  I tend to avoid falling for those types now  I don't really care about how many dudes you've fucked but if you fucked most of the dudes from my social circle that's just not gonna work for me Thanks to this group  It gives me an anchor when om lost  Great job on a year  You give me hope  You have inspired me to keep track of my own positive achievements over this next year sober so that I can revisit them at the beginning of next year  I think i'll keep a journal  Thank you for the post  I won't drink with you today   The last week  not so much  I guess realtivley is the key word  so that way  yes  And I've just completely resumed normal life from yesterday  When I do finally get home I immediately hit up my games but that's only because I don't have any work   Thank you for this post   Awesome    One of the craziest things that I've noticed the past few months is how obsessed people are with when my husband and I are going to start drinking again  We initially said that we would quit for 6 months and then go into moderate mode  lol   but I love being sober so much that I really can't imagine going back to drinking    I'm at the age where everyone is getting married  and I already have some wedding related events on my calendar for this summer  Almost everyone I've talked to brings my drinking up  saying "Oh thank god you'll be drinking again for  event  "    as if my drunkenness will determine the outcome of your bachelorette party    On another note  that's fantastic about your mom  I love hearing stories like yours that offer hope    Hey thanks so much  Drinking just really hasn't done anything   beneficial long term for me  I suffer from pretty bad anxiety as well and drinking always makes it worse the day after  hangovers cause intense anxiety for me  so I am just looking for an overall change and to get rid of this dad bod haha  Glad to be here   You aren't crazy and you aren't too far gone  I'm 24  and drank a fifth of whiskey everyday until I got sober last summer  I'm a 110 lb  girl to make that amount even more ridiculous   I actually tried to kill myself a couple of times in my last year of drinking  I thought I had ruined my mind  but it is still here    With that amount  you may benefit from a hospital stay for detox or better yet treatment  but I've seen people who drank more than either of us get sober without medical intervention  Is AA something you would ever consider  Gets a little cultish  I'm a paranoid person as well  especially when I drank  but it helps me a lot   Yeah i know it scares me too  Dont know when the stroke would have happened  I don't remember anything happening  Why would it fluctuate so much too  Like mornings it feels better than afternoons  Nights feel better too after work  Congratulations on triple digits and happy new year to you  too  Awesome man  glad you're ok now   I played it off as a joke  That's how I usually defuse things like that  Great job  Love it  We went to a friend's house for the Packer game tonight and were there for a nightmarish 30 minutes before leaving   they had all been drinking for 48 hours and I'm pretty sure there was a girl eating pizza in her sleep  Seeing people approach their twenties thirties and telling me that they're no longer into gaming because they have friends and family   This  this is what confuses me  I totally agree that getting busier means gaming a little less  but I can't imagine I'd ever completely abandon games  As I've become older I've started watching movies and TV shows a lot less to fit in gaming in my shorter and shorter free time    Multiplayer games are crazy time consumers  that's sadly the genre I like best  There's no story or single objective to go through like single player games  I like your approach of only playing those  that allows you to balance it out and get back to real life without worrying about pausing    Congratulations everybody   Looking forward to a clean January and a clean 2017   This month was a tough one for me   My semester of college ended and I found myself with more free time with nothing to do   I also have very little money because I have to start paying for the next semester of college out of pocket  so I couldn't go out anywhere really   I was stuck at home fighting boredom and loneliness   I'm proud I didn't have any relapses  but it was hard    Wow  I could have written this   Thank you    When I said that I mena headshop extracts that are sold for people who are trying to get high  The ones that may or may not have some crazy shit in them  Welcome  I will not drink with you today  They probably gave him benzos for anxiety  and those can be used to safely cold turkey off the alcohol without the fear of strokes  Start at the prescribed dose and then come down in dose over the next week or so until he gets to zero  He will have them successfully gotten off the booze and avoided benzo addiction Keep your head up  Loosing people sucks ass  one of the many reasons I continue to push on today instead of being a victim of my own mind   Oh yeah  and no more drinking as soon as the benzo is started  When is it time to let go  Will that help him realize    I can't tell you when it's time for you to let go   I threw in the towel when I realized that my relationship was so severely damaged and I was so angry that not even his sobriety could fix it    Will it help him realize  Maybe   Maybe not   Your departure may be his rock bottom    With that said  I watched a family member decimate every relationship in their lives and ultimately drink themselves to death so    Some people don't have a rock bottom    You can't control him   You can control you   You can take care of yourself and learn to love him in a way that keeps your sanity intacted  Alanon meetings helped me immensely     She's so smart  she likes science and animals and a degree in microbiology  She teaches anatomy at a college  I don't understand why it doesn't make sense to her  I really don't  It still boggles my mind after all these years   Alcoholism doesn't discriminate against intelligence  I'm still in the first 100 hours and I've been making friends  I used to be hooked to tf2 for the longest period of time and the free game Paladins finally tipped me into buying Overwatch and so far I've had a blast    Tech hobbies such as  That sounds cool  D  And a more productive substitute   To quote Lcio   sorta   "You're gonna do great"  This is irrelevant  but a long time ago I ordered a cheeseburger from McDonald's and they forgot the patty  I ate that shit anyway  It wasn't bad  I kind of miss those shitty McDoubles  Sigh    The last few years my parents have come to visit and they stock up on weed  Back in 2015 they left some cough drops with me  there were like 10 or so of them  When they came out again they were mostly there and they asked if I just didn't like them  I was like no I really enjoy it  just as a rare treat  If only I could say that about good beer or a manhattan  HAHA  can you imagine comfortably drinking like 4 beers in an entire year and not even having it come to mind  There are people out there like that  WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE    Yeah  headshop extracts suck  I bet a decent amount of them are spiked with Chinese opioids fucking losers On the other hand  what part of life does alcohol fulfill for you  It's mind boggling how invested people are   not in sobriety  but in their efforts to get us to drink  We have some family friends that literally have a countdown to when we initially said we would start drinking again  back when we were newly sober and terrified to imagine our lives without alcohol   I smile and play along because I don't want to make it weird  but in reality I just feel bad for them   The early days suck  For me  it seemed like it was mostly breaking the habit of drinking and finding other ways to occupy my time  Maybe you can find a substitute beverage  or game that you enjoy playing  Really  almost whatever it takes in the beginning is a ok  You can do it  I'm sober right along with you  If you're seizing  you can very easily and painfully die  You're going to die  Thank you so much  What a wonderful NDV    Good job     Fair enough  I've never tried it  so I don't know shit   I do identify with all those people desperate to break free from it  though    Being a slave to a substance blows    us recovering opiate addicts know exactly what I'm talking about        if you're taking it purely to circumvent withdrawals and not gaining anything legitimately therapeutic from it    Go to AA    I'm 27 and have been Sober 6 5 years  Best thing I ever did for myself  Listen to that little voice you pushed way down that says "you deserve better than this"  If you get DTs  detox first with medical professionals   Good luck all  remember to check in here often  there is no way I would be at 4 months smoke free without this sub   Haha I have had that happen a few times at a few different places  I don't see how it happens but whatever  I always take that shit back though to get it fixed  If they forget the lettuce that's one thing but forgetting the meat is just too much  Same  I was thinking of my New Years Resolutions and realized that I finally made one work  Almost 4 months smoke free    I got a cold for New Years and I was thinking this morning and bad I feel but also how much less worse I feel since I no longer smoke    This article can also inspire you  just START and go day by day    http   jamesclear com successful people start before they feel ready I reckon most of us have had our share of day 1s  I'm on day 1 again myself  A couple of times a year I decide to quit  and succeed for three months before failing  Almost every time because I think I can go into the bar and NOT drink  It fails every time  I just don't beat myself up  over it  I got laid off early in the year and went my usual three months of no drinking  and started up again around June  Only difference this time was that I replaced my 12pk a day habit with two Tallboys of those Bud Light margarita drinks  Not even enough for a decent buzz  It was mostly just to unwind after a long day  Well  I went out last night to the bar  Woke up today at noon hungover  and decided to try again    In my experience  the first week is the hardest  I might have a 6 pack of O'Douls to get me through the week  After that  it gets a LOT easier  No alcohol for me for the next 24 hours  Yucky much  2017 here I come   No alcohol for me for the next 24 hours  Yucky much  2017 here I come   23   thinking you have all the answers   an asshole sister indeed  She has some great qualities that I really admire and respect  but as long as she continues to float down De Nile  I refuse to take her bait when it comes to my sobriety  I learned to have patience with the ebbing and flowing of my commitment to sobriety  As long as I was taking the appropriate steps and using my tools  it was okay to have doubts  Vigilance and self reflection have been key   Same  This is so random but I screen shotted this earlier    I was emailing someone my newemail address and this prompt came up    To clarify I've never text you or text about you    https   imgur com 8IutADd  How weird  And then it hit me  This is dumb   I had that same ah ha moment when I was trying to make up all these rules to rein in my drinking  Usually I'm a much nicer guy when I'm drunk  I listen a lot more and generally care more  which is something since I'm already a pretty empathetic dude when I can be I think    Though I have blacked out and done some really stupid shit before  My problem is more that in the incredibly rare instance that a conflict does start  I go way overboard and don't really control myself very well  But thankfully I'm good at walking away or just avoiding conflict in general so this isn't much a problem   I have done some dumb shit like throwing my phone or smashing my laptop before while BO  That's always a fun thing to wake up to   My mom tends to be a very angry and very fucking abusive drunk   To the point where it did a lot of damage to our relationship before my drinking was a problem  It's hard to tolerate mean drunks I feel  I usually leave those people alone  I sure don't  As someone who has a history of hangovers that I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy  waking up without is one of my favorite things about being sober  Thanks yeah I was with family and the only adult not drinking and just said fuck it  Same old shit though  Thinking about the next drink before I finish the one I am on  I can't moderate and even if I manage to only drink two drinks I wake up feeling shitty and anxious  Just not worth it  It entertains  makes me feel good  passes time  makes dumb things interesting  makes conversations with strangers easier  What doesn't it do  Self knowledge won't save us  I knew what I was  also high functioning  straight A college student  got a good job in my field before I even graduated  etc    Then I stopped being high functioning and got chronic and pathetic  You don't have to bottom out  you can beat the system by quitting while you still have control  Life is duller but you don't have the lows  you know  I think if you're positing here  you must want to quit at some level  Good luck  Awesome  just awesome    well done x Right  Ends up I decided to not go there  We talked about it and she's cool with it but thinks we might should again one day  I'm undecided  Something worrisome though is that now she has decided to date this other girl she hasn't known and has never had a friendship with and is still married to a man but is in the process of a divorce and so on and on  Hopefully it will work out but thinking it might get to be too much  Now that she is sober she is capable of having feelings   and she has a lot of feelings  Very intense person when sober  So she is probably making a mistake  I don't think that girl wants to hurt her  but it may end up that way  Or maybe the opposite  She seems pretty smitten  the other girl  not my friend  Makes me think I may not should have broken it off  But I just have too much other stuff going on with college and work and stuff to have this as a constant worry   That always gets me   no one HAS to drink on New Year's  or literally any other day  Happy new year  Just remember that paranoid anxious feeling you get before you toke  Life's too short for feeling bad like that  Its your body's way of telling you something is wrong    Smoking doesn't fix anything  I know its hard but life can be enjoyable without it  Maybe go talk with someone like a therapist  Smoking and thinking negatively about life and your circumstances  is a recipe for a bad time  New year  new you  Circle of Death and videogames are definitely my favorite drinking games  I like shooting dice and betting drinks along with change too  Also I want to thank everyone for reading and responding   My wife is the most amazing person in my life  Words can't express the wonders she has done for me  Which it will still be a worry  but what can you do  I agree with above  I've been known to drink much more than the average bear  however I could hold my drugs and liquor  At some point in the last year I crossed that invisible line where I found alcohol in control of me and not the other way around  You can drink heavily for sometime before you realize your physically dependent  By the way  the physical dependence is the tip of the iceberg  emotional and behavioral maladies are much more serious and take longer to correct    that is abstaining for long periods of time  Havent been drunk yet so pretty good  You  Had a few beers but eating bulk so too full to drink much You're only high functioning until you aren't    and it WILL end  Trust me  Your story is so similar to mine  I am 27  Stopped drinking at 26  It wasn't until I turned 25 that I started getting sloppy  I thought I was invincible or special or just REALLY knew how to handle my alcohol    I always did well at work  had a great social life  awesome relationships  always on top of my shit    then one day I woke up to my boss slamming his hands on my desk as I had passed out drunk on the sales floor in the middle of the day  long story short   I still didn't quit  well I did for a month after that   And things got progressively worse  My advice  quit while you're ahead  Non alcoholics don't ask themselves constantly if they have a problem  If that thought is on your mind often  you probably do  I wish you all the best of luck and hope you're able to make the choice that's best for you  We are always here to help   Please speak from the I and do not challenge people  It's not supportive or encouraging   That's awesome  I'm at 5 months  my first one sober since I was 14  I honestly felt like it was a little dull  but this morning was refreshing at least  I was at a party at my boyfriends parents and did the same with sparkling grape juice  It does taste better at least  I got a DUI two weeks after I was hospitalized for alcohol poisoning    I didn't have an option to get sober    Believe me  I'd have rather gotten sober without having a record   This is really encouraging to hear  Thank you    I've been a vegetarian for a little over 2 years now and although my family is around 90  accepting  my mom and I still get into scream until your voice is hoarse matches over it  The moment I equated my sobriety with my vegetarianism was the day I realized that my family isn't quick to accept ANY changes  and that I just need to be patient   I believe I did speak from the I  That was apparent in my second paragraph   And I removed the challenge  Sorry about that    You have your opinion     Which is just that     An opinion  Do not bash others choices for recovery  It is a rule here   I decided to check out this post  as I'm currently about a week from the last time I used  h  subs  anything but weed   and I'm still digging on that lovely skin crawling  sweating all over feeling  for persistent problems with hyper hydrosis  try sage tea     I've seen so many wonderful and supportive posts within this community  and as I was already feeling rather low  I figured  hey  maybe this is a kind word of encouragement  or maybe this post will help reinforce my resolve  undergoing this scary  difficult time      Man  talk about a disappointing bummer     I'd never try to make any direct guarantees about what one can expect from particular substances  "everyone say they got fire    "   but I can say that those who advocate doing personal research  seeking immediate support  and cautious harm reduction are the best to look to for genuinely selfless advice  While I believe OP's heart was coming from the right direction  he skewed his message  espousing his personal mission statement as the best and only way to go  inflexible even in the face of opposing fact  rather than worrying about what's important  spreading knowledge for safe harm reduction methods  to help ease the suffering we all know too well  OP  I hope you have a good rest after your hard fight here  We are all on your side  but only if you truly  humbly want us to be      I wish luck to everyone out there  trying to make a better life for themselves  Mad mad love to everyone that has a desire to become something more than they already are  and I wish you all the courage necessary to make desire in to determination  and then in to reality  Mad love to everyone really  even the very salty and defensive OP of this post  D Please  never take any one particular person group's word as guaranteed life advice  tailor made just for you   After about 36 hours of manic insomnia  I'm not terribly eloquent  so i apologize for any dramatic errors of grammar  I've been lurking on this sub for over five years  never thought I'd actually post  but here we are haha     Find someone who has a recovery program you want and ask them to sponsor you   To what lengths are you willing to go to   I did and it worked out well  I think most people will swing between extremes a lot of times before reaching moderation    Almost everyone I've talked to brings my drinking up  saying "Oh thank god you'll be drinking again for  event  "    as if my drunkenness will determine the outcome of your bachelorette party   It's so weird  Like they can't enjoy it if you aren't drinking  I think for most people their lives revolve around it  You are so darling  and your face looks fine  You got this  girl  Don't get me wrong I feel loads better at almost seven weeks in    I mean loads better  I guess my point was that of all the threads I've read on all the different sites  I got the impression that after a couple of weeks you're done with it all and life should be back to normal  Where in reality it's a work in progress that could take months  But there's no doubt you'll feel much better before that  I think a lot of people  myself included  feel like they may never be "normal" again  when in fact they will as long as they stick with it and don't give up  I can say for sure at day 39 I'm no longer having the relentless cravings and that alone is a huge step in the right direction    You're absolutely right about kicking the habit in the beginning  It's tough to kick any habit and kratom has a weird way of keeping its claws stuck in you  It more or less becomes a daily ritual and you feel lost without it for several weeks  If I know what to expect  I can mentally prepare myself for what's to come  The thing with kratom is    every time I've quit 6 or 7 times   I've had a different experience  All based on how much I was using at the time and for how long    The hardest part for me has definitely been the mental    the anxiety  depression and fautigue I had for close to a month  I work long hours everyday    out of the house by 5am and don't get home til 6 30 or 7  I used kratom and adderall to help get me thru the day and it's been tough to learn to cope without  None the less it gets better everyday even tho I'm 40 days in   You can do it  I'm in the same boat  I will not drink tonight with you  We have ALL said and done horrible things   things we deeply regret   because of alcohol  You're not vile  Maybe your actions were  but you can fix that  And we are here to help support you  The guilt can be crushing  Try to learn to love and forgive yourself  That is such an important part of the healing process  Also  maybe try to attend an AA meeting  It helps to not feel so alone in your struggles   Drinking is a pretty sure fire way of making all of your problems worse  Including depression  Get to an aa meeting  be honest with people and listen to those who have gone through it and come out glistening on the other side I luckily haven't had the displeasure of actually being denied the sale  Has that happened to you where they got judgemental and actually wouldn't sell to you over it  Thank you  I have diagnosed alcoholism  PTSD  depression    borderline personality disorder  At five months sober  sometimes I feel like I'm never going to be happy again with or without alcohol  Your story inspired me  My HP is a universal spirit my dead grandparents  I too cringe at the prayer chanting  like less jerking off  Googling popcorn lung supports everything I said    And no shit it's not applicable to everything or everyone  No cessation method is       I used an IPV D3 with a Velocity RDA  0 5ohm coils  and a variety of different juices     It's common knowledge that vaping is   safer than smoking cigarettes     I know what it's like to have Drinking effect your job    I almost lost mine because of it  It's a terrible feeling  I just hit my 1 year mark as well  I'm so happy reading your story of success  Wishing you another amazing  sober year  You should be so proud of yourself     Congrats on your turnaround   I remember the helpless feeling    horrible place to be  If that's what it did for me  I'd have no worries  Kratom saved me  It allowed me access to choices again and the ability to rebuild my life  One year ago I was HOPELESS  I wish I had learned about it sooner but grateful it was not any later   New years consistently remains the most difficult holiday for me  If there is one holiday that really revolves around booze it's this one  I fell asleep at 9 30 and got so much flak  Glad it's over  Let the new year begin  No hooch for me  Right  I've also had friends tell me that I can't be pregnant at their weddings so that I'll be able to drink  I keep an arsenal of snarky replies just for these oddly specific conversations  I honestly didn't notice the first few bites  I thought it was a bit odd  but I kept eating  It wasn't until I actually looked down that I realized what was going on  At that point I felt sort of stupid walking back up to the counter  They probably would have made fun of the fact that it took me so long to figure it out      Edit  it was one of those small  1 cheeseburgers  nothing fancy   12 5 days in here and I'm using Quit Pro  I like it because it's easy to see how long I've gone  how much I've saved  and it also tells you some of the benefits that you should be experiencing as they happen  Also has some good motivational stuff too but you can only read 15 unless you get the full version  but that's no biggie OH my God I haven't had a great night's sleep in the past two weeks   and talking about being tired    I've forced myself to get up and get to moving so that I didnt ruin my kids winter break    I'm going to break free of this curse this time    Thank you so much  It seems surreal that I've made it to 100  Can't wait for 200  This time of year is particularly challenging for me with so many hours of darkness  starting around 4 30 pm where I'm at   Dark   cold   tough to be motivated to tinker in the garage  go outside  etc  The temptation to drink can be pretty strong  but I would rather be bored and go to bed early than stay up drinking and feel sluggish the whole next day  No but I work in retail and I've seen it happen  Usual result is someone senior getting called over and asking you more politely to leave  If you refuse then security is called  Awesome  Happy New Year   Enjoyed reading this  Thank you for sharing  Recovery really is an amazing thing   I use the Smoke Free  stop smoking app  David Crane   android  It has nice layout on the home page  where you can see how much you've saved  how many cigs you've avoided and how long you've been smoke free  It also allows you to put a widget on your phone's home screen which is nice   Misery loves company unfortunately   I fucked up  Threw out my ecig last night then this morning I cracked and bought a pack  Got two cigs in then threw out the pack and got my ecig out of the trash  Baby steps I guess  Two days in and still here  You have to want to stop  you can't just feel like it's something you shouldn't do  You have to have a reason not to do something that makes you feel good and that reason is different for everyone  Personally  I had a self reflecting trip on shrooms and realized that I was letting too many things control me  including weed  It's not an overnight realization and takes baby steps  just realize what is important to your happiness  If you want to talk drop me a pm I did not drink with you last night   I'm not sure  TBH  I'm not sure if I have an alcohol problem myself  but I fear that I might  At the moment  quitting is not something I can commit to   I'm also in the same boat as you  I don't drink everyday  most days in fact I don't  However  when I do I convince myself that it's ok  end up binging and feeling full of regret afterwards   This cycle has continued for me and it's a little troubling Awesome to hear this  3 months  Way to go  That's a great way to look at it  Good on ya   Whoever created that blog still needs to "launch" it  according to WordPress  Just remember  while it's good to stay positive  relapsing every 11 days isn't the same as quitting  Your next step is to be offered a joint by your friend and not smoke it   Congratulations on breaking through 100 days  Like you I'm a total NOMO head  I've been using it since just about day one  Those folks who built that app are really great people and if you ever have a problem  reach out and they fix it in a snap   Watching the weight melt away felt so great and with all the money saved on not drinking  it felt okay to have to keep buying new pants      I won't drink with you today  The only way to get out of the binge restrict cycle is to stop restricting  Just eat when you're hungry but focus on eating healthy  unprocessed whole foods   I struggled with binge eating and restricting and constantly lost and gained weight but since I have stopped restricting  I don't eat less than 2000 calories  the binge eating has stopped   It will take a long time for your metabolism to heal and you won't lose weight as quickly as you'd like  you may even gain some as you learn to eat when you're hungry  but in time your body will adjust and will let go of unnecessary fat  The first week I decided to stop restricting I must have eaten 3000 5000 calories every single day  no junk food   mainly bananas  nuts  dates etc  and I actually lost over a kilo in that week   Overall I haven't lost the weight I would like to lose but I have actually been able to largely maintain the same weight for once in my life  Also I've come to accept that maybe the weight I'd like to be just isn't realistic for me because of my body frame  I'm still working on it   sometimes I get fed up and decide that I'm going to restrict for a few weeks because I think I'm cured and won't binge but after a week of restricting I binge again  It's a cycle and the only way to stop bingeing is to stop restricting   Finally making it a reality  I'm done spending my time alone in front of my computer reacting to pixels change colors  feverishly chasing some temporary  meaningless point value that some developer arbitrarily assigned and will eventually replace  My in game achievements are not achievements  Sunk costs are only compounded regrets  not investments     No gaming  No watching streams  I understand that  I guess it's always just confused me that to her there's a way to rationalize everything  She's such a no nonsense  practical person otherwise  I guess I'm just venting  No matter what consequences come from something it never seems to matter  Is it possible you're mentally psyching yourself out about quitting and youre afraid  Maybe even at a subconscious level  I'm only asking because    that sort of mental anxiety energy exacerbated my physical state when heading towards quitting pain meds  Mental shit can really manifest itself physically    I'm also not a doctor  and you know your body  If something ain't right  go see a Dr  Wouldn't hurt     Great work earning that chip  I'm going to my first meeting tomorrow  any advice you'd be willing to share  I will not drink today   In fact  I don't even have any desire to   Too much other stuff going on  One year   High five Checking in  I have had some urges so far but not given in  I think posting will help me  You can still sign up January  I signed up for both  Let's do it  Came across this sub by chance  I generally lurk  had no idea this was hear  Things could be better for me  but I wish you all strong luck this year  You guys seem great   Still am homeless and hanging on white knuckled   Good job  We're all proud of you  I can relate soooooo much to this  For the first 4 6 months I let myself eat whatever as long as I didn't drink  Every time I had a craving  I got fruit slices haha  Man I love those things  Now I'm able to eat healthy and try to get my sugar from eating fruits   I've done the pour out thing too  typically because I didn't want to keep drinking   It always feels like a victory  and more often than not  it's because I want it to be a grand gesture that I'm walking away for good   It took a lot of times to realize that ending up breaking my promise to myself was a sign of dependence  I will not drink with you  either   Raising my water glass to you  though   My best advice is to plan out each day with activities and strategies so you don't unwittingly fall back into old habits  Sponsor not counselor   No training or approval needed to become a sponsor   Don't judge AA by single member   There is no real membership in that you don't apply and get accepted  you just show up  There are service boards  Then maybe you might have to increase water intake  Or do you think it's a hormonal imbalance  I'm only a couple days in  hang in there we are gunna do this  That's 8 hours you have back  it's yours  not alcohols  Don't give alcohol any more time  I mean  it just reads like an advertisement that serves as anything other than to benefit anyone but the salesman  Doctors and AA were the only ways I managed through immediate and post acute withdrawals  You've done good progress  You're moving from games full time to games   Youtube   Then you can go Youtube full time  then move to another hobby   Our addictions just move around  from games to youtube  then reddit or facebook   I don't exactly know what happens in your body when your brain goes from relying on THC to provide it happiness  to no longer having that substance     But for me  smoking was an escape from being sad  anxious  stressed  etc  I never actually learned to cope with stress and anxiety  I just smoked until I didn't feel bad anymore  So now  I am actually learning how to deal with life  My memory also sucks because I used to wake and bake every morning  and now my days aren't foggy  I remember what waking up was like today  and exactly what I did this morning  I can also talk to people now    Weed was always a way to feel less lonely for me  I was perfectly fine with spending every night with my bong on my couch  and now I see that that's just not what life is about  I realized that I enjoy being around others  and I enjoy listening to what they have to say and being able to respond in an intelligent  meaningful way  The subdued girl glued to the couch  having no emotional response to anything because she's too stoned to care    That's not me  I am on day 9 and already finding out that I want to be so much better   Im not exactly 100  clean but i woke up hangover free this year  Probs first time in 14 years  Saw this sub when drunk maybe a week ago and i swore id be sober new years day and i was  I did have a few during new years eve day but stopped at dinner apart from one beer at 8  Then drove up to watch fireworks with my son and cousin  Def sober drive i kept it very spaced apart dont worry lol  Thats a pretty big step for me even tho sounds shit  2017 going to be different  In a good way  That's what always got me   I could break it off  but the worry wouldn't stop  so leaving didn't make me feel better  If you're having a hard time separating from her  don't beat yourself up or force yourself into it unless you truly feel it's right  And if you try to leave and end up going back and leaving and going back again  don't beat yourself up  This is  hard   and struggling to get out of a messed up dynamic doesn't mean you'll never leave it  or that your life will never get better  or that it won't get better unless you follow a prescribed method   Big piece of wisdom I've been gaining in my struggles  if you have a hard time reaching your goals  maybe there's a good reason  I tried and tried to detach from a loved one  failed every time  then began to realize that detachment wasn't the way for me    and lo and behold  I don't have any huge regrets about the way things have gone   Not that you and I are the same person  Letting go might be a great path for you  All I'm saying is  follow the external information that actually makes sense to you  plus the intuition in your heart  "Following sensible sounding advice because a lot of people believe it" isn't anywhere in that equation  Nah  it's not anything like that  but thanks  I know what you mean  It is the best idea you will ever have to help yourself  I wish I quit or even had the idea that quitting was an option when I was 16  10 years ago  Quit  porn isn't going to enrich your life  It won't love you  It is empty sexuality  it is a waste of time   If I could go back to your age  I would drop all that shit in a heart heat  Use our inaction and hindsight to your advantage  Quit now and never look back  It will be way easier at 16  At 16  you've got to undo what maybe 4 years of damage  I've got to do undo the damage I caused my brain from 14   26  so 12 years of daily use or more  I'm guessing that's for if someone is sloppy drunk slurring falling over  Only if you give me a blue phat  Haha thanks man  D maybe she is just awkward and didn't mean anything hurtful by it  I do stuff like that on accident once in a while   This describes my issues when I was drinking    Don't smoke any more    When I stopped I craved sugar candy for a few weeks   Things starting to normalize now  There are a lot of nuances to making amends  One part of the step states that one should make amends to someone except when to do so would harm them  An example MIGHT be going to the husband who is oblivious of the fact you fooled around with his wife and saying  hi  I need to make amends to you  I slept with your wife  That would be harmful to the wife and the husband and their relationship  not your place to do that  It is ok to say  hey  I stole  20 out of your wallet  I'd like to pay you back with interest  I say all that because you may not be in possession of all the facts or all the efforts this person has tried to do to make amends  There is also no time limit on it  you can take years making amends    In regards to him being "nominated to counsel someone"   that's not how it works  You can sponsor some one  kind of a mentor for lack of a simpler explanation  and usually the sponsee approaches the sponsor and they come to a mutual agreement  There is no governing body who decides you can or cannot sponsor someone   It sounds like you have some serious outstanding issues with this person  Maybe you should approach them and see if AA has had a positive impact on their life  It sounds to me like you are holding a grudge and have not forgiven this person for the past indiscretions and are now trying to sabotage their success  In AA we try not to judge someone by their past  By going through the 12 steps  one of which is making amends  we can hope to change and remove our character defects  and become more altruistic and help other alcoholics    There are several reasons why somebody in the program has not made direct amends yet  They may not have remembered a wrong  a direct amends may injure them or others  or they may just not be ready yet   My advice is to just leave it be  You can only be responsible for your own character  This year went very similarly for me  I had 60 days and then started back up last Friday and drank until last night   I have been on and off this year but haven't really committed  always trying to bargain and find a loophole   Back to day one  Wish I knew how to edit  I should have said " make amends except when to do so would harm them OR OTHERS" "Hair o the dogs the only cure  so wheres the grog" quote from an

drinking  and I usually wake up super early and can't go back to sleep  Last night  I slept ten uninterrupted hours     She's not awkward  but I recognize that even phone conversations can get lost in translation  I try to give people the benefit of the doubt  which is why I didn't make a big deal out of it  Everyone makes mistakes  and I wasn't going to rake her over the coals for a slightly rude comment   Thanks   I don't like pancakes  but then I can say beef with butter  D  D me neither  High five   Thank you  I'm creating so many opportunities for growth as I continue forward  Congratulations on 274 days  My public goals were abs by 31st December 2017 and always waking up early between 5   7am  On January 1st I had 2 chocolate bars when I woke up at midday  So off to a great start  My secret goal is one full year without watching a single porn video  Still not yet watched any   I can relate to virtually everything you said here  I don't even look at myself in the mirror after a binge    You've got this man  We've got this  because really what do we have to lose  Porn  Ha  And thanks for taking the time to read and comment  It means a lot  It truly is  Congratulations on one year  Same  Such an odd feeling  I'm glad I'm not the only one   Ehh the withdrawal from kratom for me is nothing   Couple days of anxiety and insomnia and light  very light  RLS  MUCH easier than like methadone or sub   especially methadone   thats the most painful shittiest thing I have ever been through  Weeks of hell  but everybodies different  I agree though kratom isn't some miracle  Thanks PG  Your presence on this sub has helped me so much on this journey  What a truly wonderful gift that you are giving him  I hope that you enjoyed your time being fully present with your family  Continued success in 2017  I'm so glad this helped  The way I see it is that I am taking my life back from a place that afforded me an unpleasant  dark future  Hey  thank YOU for commenting  I felt alone spilling all of this with no one commenting so I'm grateful for every single reaction   How long have you been smoking   Do you only smoke in the morning   Have you tried other ways to consume it   How illegal is it where you live btw    Last week  I was on holidays and couldn't stop smoking  I got scared  so I decided to take the car and leave for a few days without taking the weed  First day is a bit tough and second one too really  but then it was ok  It's true  my conversation skills are not the same  my inspiration is not the same  my attention to details is not the same but I was still capable of appreciating life in general  even if I was alone  It's very reassuring to see that the withdrawal is nearly non existent after a few days   I'm scared of weed  scared of the fact that I may be lying to myself and that I don't really need it  Usually  these thoughts come when I sober up after a period of high  But the thing is  I don't really sober up  The introspection and behavioural change than happens while high stays with me to some extent even if I stay away from it for some time  So it's easy to think that I don't really need it when I'm still enjoying the benefits     I read the rest of the sub here and the main reason people leave it is because they use to run away from important issues  I don't think I do that  I have a job  I don't have a debt  I'm single with no one to take care of  The only think I might not be taking care of is my dreams and I'm not sure if they are best served high or not  I think it's worth trying both as long as i'm not losing anywhere else   What I find most difficult is keeping a workout discipline when using regularly  It's my first objective if 2017   find out how to do both   I'll be happy to keep in touch with you  just to see how it goes and how you doing  Same here  Although had a few beers  food and family stopped me from drinking much  My cousin had her baby on the 1st and my mum said "oh no everyones usually too hungover to care" i said not me n she laughed  "1st time ever haha" wellll its a start  I was fairly stoked after being a pisshead for 14 years  1st new years with no hangover since 15  Im aussie       Honestly  once you quit smoking you may find that the depression and anxiety go away    I like to search "moderation" in the SD search bar and read all the posts and comments  including mine  about moderation fails  It always gets my attention   I'm not necessarily sure I'm done forever   But I knew I made the right choice to take a long break when I had next to zero cravings to smoke once I stopped  Good job taking this step  We've got your back  Get the book off the side bar  If you can't sleep listen to the 'alcohol mastery'  podcast  Take action  Get on it  This is what I tell myself too  Makes a huge difference when you remind yourself that this is a choice that you have agency over  We don't drink because we choose not to  not because we can't  It certainly seems like you're worried about it  and you've said that you regret drinking    Perhaps you could try to quit for 30 days and see how you feel at the end of it    Only you can decide if you have a problem  but when I was starting to quit  I found it helpful to read others' stories here  to see whether I could relate to what they were going through  Turns out I could relate to just about everyone posting here in some way  And  I knew that my drinking habits had become uncomfortable and overall my life was very unhappy  That was what I needed to start the process of recovery   The label of alcoholic isn't important  I felt I had a problem when I was not able to stop drinking even when I wanted to  I couldn't make it 30 days when I was really trying  I would be able to give up other things I loved and enjoyed in for an indefinite period  like chips  which tells me I don't have a problem with those things   I am with you  Here we go  I will not drink with you today  I have gotten the book and just about to get started with it  What a beautiful show of support   The only way to get back on track is to get back on track  For me  writing down how cruddy I felt being hungover and the like was really helpful to me the next time I felt like having a drink   I'm only 22  heavy daily smoking for the last 4 years  and I'm getting this feeling too a week in  It's pretty awesome  At what point did you get the "extreme clear headedness" everyone talks about  Hey  it's a new start  I recently saw a few folks with whom I used to drink  It was clear they're still doing the same old  same old  and sadly  it was pretty obvious just by looking at them   It didn't make me miss it at all  rather it made me really happy for how my life has improved since stopping  This is yet another drug that a doc will gladly give u without attaching the possibility of developing a serious dependence  I got on it when in detox for morphine and poppy tea  nobody told me it was habit forming  A few months later I had a brutal wake up call getting on the GABA  It's frustrating  cuz it really does help  For me  getting off the GABA felt like benzo w d  Screw that  I'm so terrified of every single med drug plant now  Seems like I always end up paying some big price down the road   Thank you for your encouraging words  This is exactly why I have started writing and blogging  Keep an eye on me for future writings  Pub  Sounds aussie to me  Where ya from   I made a two page list of activities I want to do  places to go  restaurants to try  hikes to take  shops to visit  and I plan my schedule a week at a time  I am too busy to get bored  My danger zone is happy hour   get home from work early no plans bar time   What a cutie  And great job    Love this  thank you for sharing  Congratulations on 11 months and losing 40bs  That's awesome  I'd really like to hear people's response to this too   I find it really boring to be around drinking people after a couple hours  But my husband  and all our friends drink and he is not ready to leave a party after two hours  Or if we go out to dinner with friends  we have to stop at a couple of bars on the way home  I end up feeling irritated and annoyed with them all and just want to leave   or start drinking   One of my triggers too  Undermining my own fun  I would be creative on the pc  programming or drawing  and decided it requires a few beers to be perfect as I felt great    after two or three the "buzz" that is alcohol kills the "buzz" that is creativity  and replaces the void with indifference   I regret these moments   Exercise is a great way to boost self confidence and feel better about the way you look    bonus points because you get to eat more afterwards  Damn  that would drive me crazy  Your flatmate and ex sound like turds  Way to stay classy and sober  My hat's off to you  Word  No drinking tonight   I waited a month before masturbating  but I quit porn for reasons other than PIED and did have sex multiple times during that month  I think in your case you may want to wait longer than that  but I also think it's important to eventually separate P from MO at some point  The nice thing with separating them is that I found masturbation without porn or fantasizing to be far more enjoyable than I ever remember it being   Update  Talked to him about going to a meeting  he says he's been to them and they make him feel depressed  Counseling   Happy year to you as well   Yay for us making it through our first sober holiday season     As far as losing the job  at the time it was scary as I was the main provider for my household  Honestly  I hated the job  it sucked  i was underpaid and overworked and my intense unhappiness connected with that job added to my alcohol consumption  Losing that job was one of the best things that ever happened to me  It was the catalyst to my new career and for that I'm so happy  Definitely NOT encouraging people to get wasted and fired or use alcohol as a coping mechanism for their shitty jobs   I'm just happy about the way things worked out   I'm 22 and I havent smoked or ate or vaporized since December 16th and I don't feel any different  I still feel very cloudy and almost perma fried   I went for a skii today and I didn't cough out anything  In fact  my lungs felt great  I know there isn't any physical detrimental damage  but my mental sure doesn't seem to feel any different   Congrats to all 398 who participated throughout the year  You're all awesome  Keep on trucking in 2017   yup  not worth it  I had a relapse a few weeks ago and i actually had two hits of a joint and I was like nahhhhhh   Woah  That's really cool  Congratulations        good for you it's the small victories like that that add up to success I think you already know what you need to do  I know for me I like to justify eating by exercising beforehand  With that in mind  maybe suggest going for a walk run together and grabbing a drink or snack together  Also letting her know you're there if she needs a shoulder to lean on would be a good idea  Being a supportive and healthy role model  as Iroklife suggested  is a really good way to help her see what it's like to have a positive relationship with food  Good luck totally unrelated but your screen name is hilarious     Definitely  It will help you develop good habits and not waste precious years as a teen    Source  in 21  14 18 were wasted on things like porn   Yea  some of the worst angry drunks out there are just people who don't drink very often but holy fuck when they do    it all comes spewing out    Learn to communicate while sober or semi sober  Something makes you mad or sad  Say it  don't just bottle it up and unleash it once you've had enough liquid courage    Because this is what happens most of the time  you're drunk and mad and the people you're with are not going to be following your line of thought at that point sober or drunk    They'll just get pissed right back at you  because they have no idea what's even going on or what your problem is  To survive as a drunk you have to have some sober coping skills  That's a great tip  I've been having "moderation fantasies" recently  like way too much of my day is spent fantasizing about this   Next time  I will do that search and see what there is to see  Congratulations on an entire year  I will not drink with you today  I'm confused  What does from the I mean  And what's the thing with challenging people  Guilty  On my first overseas holiday  I got drunk as fuck off those little bottles of free wine on the plane and proposed  not for the first time  to my partner  The person in the seat next to me overheard and congratulated us   7 years later  still with my partner  still not married  Instead of staying home and ordering pizza  suggest you go out for a walk and grab something nice to eat afterwards  Exercise is a great way to boost self confidence and have a more positive relationship with body image  It's also a great stress relief  which could help and reduce stress related eating in her case  I totally understand your handover situation  On holidays in another country this was the only time i CRAVED pot  was when i was lying in the hotel room sooo hungover  Like a true addict i made sure i wasn't in that position the following night  but that's my issue   Stay strong im going to join the sober journey shortly  12 years is too long   I'm glad you're here and looking for help  You're asking for medical advice  which few of us on here are qualified to give  If it were me  I'd definitely see a doctor ASAP  I wouldn't want to face withdrawals without medical supervision   I'm out here rooting for you  Thank you for your words of encouragement  I feel like this time will be the one where I quit for good  Speaking from the I means speaking from experience  We don't give direct advice on SD  It comes from a peer support model of recovery  I don't know you  You knoq you  Me telling you what to do and how to think isnt what we do on sd  So we tell our story  share what worked for us   Instead of saying "you need to look at it like this"  which is an attempt to set someone straight   we say "I look at it like this"   The challenging part just isn't supporting  It's directly telling someone "this is what I believe you need"   Hope that clarifies  Yes we take this place very seriously  I know it sounds intense  but we've grown a lot because of the way we approach one another   I do that too  To numb my feelings or thoughts as sometimes I overthink everything  I used to just watch a good movie when I was stressed out  I enjoyed it    Now I barely have the attention span  and hate the thought of going to a movie on a Saturday when I could be home drinking  It's sooooooooo horrible to admit that    I loved going to the movies on the weekend  Now when it's Saturday  every moment is about when should I start drinking    The weekends have been the worst  as I feel it's an excuse to drink from morning to night  The past two months have been far better resisting the urge to drink on fridays and sometimes sundays  and I never drink morning to night anymore on the weekend    I used to be so productive  I would tell people that I could never get addicted to anything because I was so passionate about what I was doing    One week I counted the hours to be about 26 hours of the 7 day week being drunk  That's a whole day I could of been doing what I wanted    Congratulations   Sounds like you've had a great year  I will NOT drink with you today    Negativity reduces positivity  So naturally if you want a positive life  a lot of negativity will be reduced     I pushed a lot of people out of my life because I had such a negative outlook but now that I see how much better I feel without alcohol  I naturally push people who drink out  Not purposely but just because it's not attractive anymore  My best friend and I brought eachother down and I'm trying to help him come out of it with me  Exercise is what helped me start eating properly again  Food   fuel  No fuel   can't exercise  Eventually getting stronger   fitter became more important than restricting my eating  So in order to be my best  I had to eat enough to give me the energy to work out   Maybe the whole exercise thing will appeal to your boyfriend   Dude  it must realllly suck  I'm tapering and I'd tell u to go ahead and taper  but guess what  Tapering sucks too  You're a whole week in   I hope u can muster the resolve to just push through  It IS gonna get better  It's so hard to not know WHEN  U have to believe it will  because it will  Our brains do heal  All your suffering has been healing  Please don't give up  U deserve it   Very insightful and helpful post   I'm always interested to hear from people who break the big barriers  and 100 is certainly a  huge  barrier   It's weird  but when I read your post and all you've accomplished  I find myself practically yelling at the computer screen "don't do it    don't give in "    Congrats on your year  your post is inspiring and awesome  So it sounds like you identified a trigger for wanting watch porn  That's always a good first step  the trick for me is actually eliminating all of the triggers  I always find myself trying to justify why I needed to keep doing this or that  but if I have to argue with myself about it that's usually a good indication that it would be safer to remove the activity to avoid a trigger  So yeah  good luck  Do you feel like it takes you a few days to get back to normal    For me it's always 2 3 days after drinking  Then something completely stressful happens  or any other excuse there is under the that I use  and I begin drinking again    How do you make it sober a whole week  I feel like that's just too hard   I have been addicted   physically dependent on pretty much anything but stimulants at one point or another  From my experience in terms of withdrawn after effects benzos and antidepressants are by far the worst  Some things  like the nerve damage from the klonopin in my legs  I will have for the rest of my life  Did u stop the Adderall too  I'd think that any stimulant would make the anxiety so much worse in the beginning  I'm not even close to done tapering  but the morning anxiety is pretty intense  I think an Adderall would push me over the edge   Checking in  My dreams came back around day 3  but I've only been smoking for about 4 years and only the last 1 2 have been daily use  I'm so sorry to hear about your loss  stay strong  Hopefully your dreams return soon    Happy birthdays    Easy there  if you relapse you definitely won't be the first  or the last  I'm not saying let your guard down  but be careful about having a do or die attitude  It seems great when you get started  but I found that having that outlook just wore me down instead of building a more positive vibe  Worse  when I did relapse it made it a lot more difficult to get back on the horse    "Failure is simply the opportunity to begin again  this time more intelligently "   Henry Ford Checking in  The most I've been sober I think  in the past year  is probably four days in a row  I think making it to Friday would be such an accomplishment for me  I'd probably celebrate with drinking  To make it a whole 7 days  all the way through the weekend doesn't even seem possible    How do you resist the urge of drinking alcohol  I've been there too  I found Annie Grace's book is very educational and inspiring  Good luck to you  Why one last one  I believe your on the right track about finding balance  Seems like lots of things are coming at you all at once  Life has a way of dishing it all out whether your up for it or not  Ive found that drinking to escape from issues   isn't of any real help  Just postpones things ya gotta address anyway  I feel better as soon as tackled it and dont have to include my drinking to it  I wish you strength  and rewards   Sign me up It's already early evening here in Australia  and my usual time to have that first drink   I'm already not drinking with you tonight  We're not able to answer these specific medical questions  if you're worried you should speak with a doctor about the symptoms  The withdrawals are different for everyone   Got very little sleep on second night  Made it through though  Still hanging in there   Might sound a little weird but next time you get a craving take a 3 block walk and turn around and head home   Okay so it's six  Just stomp out your frustration in every step and breathe  Breathe    Pm me any time   Love that song   Stop attacking X mas trees  Why is there so many excuses for drinking  How do you stop the excuse making  You know how many people are going hungry  Come on ffs dont waste food  What  kind of reaction did you want here  Done with hat gaming crap   Temptation is still hanging around  but it can kiss my ass   Signing in  Keep it up pal  Just hit 22 days here  Take it as slow as you need to   Thanks man  I kinda feel they're mutually supportive now  the habits but also the quitting  We'll see  Good luck to you too  it's definitely your fault   you control yourself  not someone else   if she was drinking and pressuring you into it then it would be her that should smarten up Very cool  Only one way to find out  My wife committed me after a wild binge  which included paranoia and me saying some suicidal stuff  I had a BAC over 2 5  I am now over 3 years sober  You can do it  Get the help you need  I got a PTSD diagnosis  went to a therapist who specialized in trauma therapy   That changed my life and freed me from all the intrusive thoughts triggering that was happening for me   I also did EMDR as part of my therapy   was amazed at how well it worked   I worked hard on my mental health which ultimately gave me the strength to address my drinking   Good luck   There is life beyond PTSD   you can get there   I saw several therapists before I found the one that was right for me  and I also 'interviewed' therapists before choosing to work with the one I ultimately chose   Your mental health is so important so good for you for choosing to focus on it       With you on the nofap  Not so sure about the slogan lol  "Less fiends in '17" I guess has a ring to it   Don't mean to scare you or anything  but whistle in your breath is an early symptom of COPD  All the more reason to continue with this quit and make it last   But do look into it for sure Hi  Glad your here  I think of how I seem to have a alter ego when drinking  This person is tacky  rude  and well a just kinda gross  I'm not her  I have class and manners  So the alcohol really is my enemy  It persist in turning me into another person and I've had to fight for who I know I am  We know who we are  I'm so glad to be free of the misery   Still fighting but winning  Then we  get to feel better  YOU WILL   One step at a time      Congrats my friend  ARE YOU DETOXING   TRY HYDROCODONE   YOU'LL BE AMAZED HOW HYDROCODONE MAKES YOU FEEL BETTER DURING WITHDRAWALS   Why are we allowing this  Please only post when sober

motivated  A year ago I quit smoking  something I never thought I'd be able to do   so I'm feeling confident I can do this too  especially with a place like this to help me    "I CAN QUIT ANYTIME I WANT  I JUST CHOOSE NOT TOO"   facepalm Just try to remember that bacteria lives on your finger tips  and it has no business being in your face  Stay strong  Jail got me clean   Meetings   They will take care of you   Just the other day we went out with a guy in Day 4 of detox and we forced him to eat some eggs and drink coffee and he came back the next day and said he slept and he felt so good    we laughed and cried    social interaction   I promise  Day one  No real cravings  Though I am having trouble going to sleep     She was also the major cause why I became depressed and alcoholic in the past years  No she wasn't   It saved me a while ago as well   It's a good place  it all depends on how much she is taking   Nodding off does not sound normal unless you are taking ridiculous amounts    Being a little out of it does sound like Kratom   Again if she is taking it you have to know amounts for us to know if it could be a danger  Kratom alone is not very dangerous but one can get addicted to it    Good for you  Reddit   Seriously  in very early sobriety I'd spend HOURS  more hours than usual  on reddit just to keep my mind occupied  I didn't care if others thought I was wasting time  I wasn't drinking and that's all that mattered  As time has gone on  I'm slowly going out and spending less time on here   I still spend a lot of time here  though  haha    Any particular reason you want to quit  You do not have to spend any time with people who abuse you and you are not obligated to participate in your parents' drama     You don't mention either of those conditions  but perhaps they exist and you just didn't mention it     Alcoholics don't change until things get so bad  they can't stand it anymore   When we stop enabling them  sometimes the natural consequences of their own actions catch up with them and they choose to get sober  So one of the best things we can do for them is to let them face the consequences of their decisions     My parents' behavior did not require me to go 100  no contact  but it did require me to set firm boundaries  including hanging up or walking out when things crossed the line    Alanon helps me see where to set boundaries that allow me to keep a relationship with my alcoholic mother in spite of her continued drinking      How do I tell her not to stress me because it makes me want to drink   You don't   Removed   duplicate post Making amends is part of the "steps"   You don't have to complete the steps to participate in the program   It's highly recommended and you'd hear it spoken of in just about any meeting but it's not necessary   AA is relatively loosely organized and that's a good thing   It keeps it approachable and comfortable for people who may be non committal about getting sober   But it sounds like you have a grudge and maybe you ought to address it directly  Yes  let's  You'll get there  For me I definitely knew when it was time  That's what I have been sharing with people  You'll know when enough is enough " Only  16" It's not a healthy habit  no matter your age  Quit while you're still young  it'll be easier to kick  For me the two most noticeable things are the insanely vivid dreams and the lack of appetite    I smoked multiple times daily too and I'm about three weeks clean  only smoked twice in those three weeks but haven't at all in the past week and a half  and I'm just starting to get back to normal sleep   normal dreaming  Appetite is mostly back to normal too    Haven't felt much difference yet in mentality or moods   though  I do feel a bit less fried in the mornings  I wake up more throughout the night though  I used to sleep soundly through the entire night    I've heard people also experience sweating and irritability but neither has been too much of an issue for me    I think most of the major physical withdrawal effects will pass within a few weeks  From then on its all psychological   Just get though each craving 1 at a time  It goes away eventually I promise  Also go to the gym tomorrow  Run as far as you can before you have to stop  Go the next day  and the next day  You will be amazed at how much further you can get on day 3  By a week I bet you will be running further than you ever have   Actually being able to see my lung function improve made a huge difference for me   Made me think   LOOK what fools they are due to drinking    If they sobered up they could see how disrespectful they are being  I've been trying to turn around the respect issues in my home since I got sober   I was treated with less respect due to my guilt  Its changing I think you will see changes as long as you dont drink       Yeah I figured it'd be a month if not longer for me too   I was smoking all day everyday for several years and dabbing pretty heavily every night  Didn't help that I'm also in a position where I can smoke pretty much as much bud as I want for free either  I'm hoping once I get back into lifting and give it a few more weeks my head will feel much clearer  I feel this  Weed makes you feel like you don't need anything but weed to enjoy yourself  At first it's freeing because you don't need to go through the  hassle of making plans  maintaining relationships  leaving your apartment  etc  All you need is a bit of bud and the TV  or in my case video games   But then eventually you realize that's a lie  You do need other people to be happy  truly happy  and the weed is just inhibiting that   temptation will pass over time  hang in there  you've got this  This week will take forever  It's not going to be easy but you can do it  I recommend going for a run down your street today  See how far you can get before you just can't go anymore  Then tomorrow do the same  In a week you will have gone 5 or 6 times as far  That is how quick your lungs start to repair themselves  Some people say if you never drink  you'll never become an alcoholic   I'm not so sure  Your story sounds like mine   I didn't start drinking daily till my 30s  but looking back  my first drinks  like yours  were totally messed up including embarrassing behavior and blackouts   So I believe I was an alcoholic my whole life     my mom's alcoholism left me damaged in ways that needed to be addressed   She taught me some messed up priorities   Alanon helped me straighten that crap out   Perhaps if I'd done this when I was your age  I could have avoided a bunch of pain and maybe even the damage of my own alcoholism      I love this  Congratulations  Sign me up if it's not too late please Checking in  Happy New Years to everyone   May your Willpower be unwavering and prevalent in this rough journey ahead  Definitely excited to be here  After being the only sober one at a new year's party  which was still a blast   I drove everyone home  then helped shovel the fresh snow around our building  Slept in due to heavy lifting  and for once not because of a hangover withdrawl       Fairly confident I'll stick with it  I don't have much in the way of dependency issues with drinking  but once I'm going it's like a train going full tilt  so the the motivation here is to just not start in the first place  Looking forward to being healthier and happier in 2017   to have patience with the ebbing and flowing of my commitment to sobriety   I needed to hear this  Thanks    It takes a week or two  but eventually you will sleep better because you don't have nicotine racing through your blood  Day 20   There with ya bro   Physically I'm good   Tired  sure  but really just waiting for the opportunity to get to be me again   The way I'm feeling  never again will I fuck with this plant  Try the gold ones next time  I can't describe the taste    Carmel maybe   but yeah I can't any of the others down  Not necessarily   12 step meetings aren't for everyone   And some of them kinda make  me  depressed TBH  Fortunately I didn't let that run me off  because I go to some pretty awesome ones   I didn't go "Oh  AA must be terrible" just because I went to a weird group   He could have legit had a bad experience   I'd say try another one at a different place and time  Maybe an "open" one you can attend together if he's just anxious not knowing anyone there   Things and people change too  I attended several when I was 21 and I  hated  them  I didn't think I'd ever go back  I'm glad I did   The cast always changes too  so things are always in flux  Honestly new people always come and not everyone stays  I might like a group that I didn't a year ago   Then there's Smart Recovery and local support groups not to mention IOP  group sessions sort of CBT style facilitation  and if he's got insurance look into that  I had a lot of fun at IOP and it wasn't anything like AA  I kind of miss those groups       Then there's a lot of people on SD  reddit and IRC  with triple quad day digit counts that just get support online here  That kind of floored me  I didn't think "online" really worked   I volunteer for a site that has online 12 step meetings in the NA format  They usually push hard on bridging f2f and insisting online doesn't work  Some of this was later revealed to have originated from people who were not actually working a program or steps and didn't have a lot to say about the NA way of life  So they just parroted the same crap and it caught on over the years   But I don't know  I'm seeing other people disagree and say they're clean and sober and using tools here and getting what they need  SD seems to applaud whatever works  I agree    I'm seeing people on the other site get whacked with all the things they're not doing good enough  meetings  sponsor  steps  etc   I think some people get discouraged and just give up  That's not the only path to recovery but I respect that it's the path laid out by NA  I dont like the amount of pressure that gets exerted around all that and as far as I can tell neither do many visitors  Attrraction  not promotion right  SD is kind of interesting reading for me right now and maybe it'll foster further discussion about our messaging down the road      At least on Reddit I can say whatever the hell I want about all that    P I was broke as fuck ITT  Every CA Mother loses ttheir shit  I'm going to stop drinking as well  tomorrow will be day 1 for me as well  I might buy a couple benzos tuesday to ease the transition  and smoke some good weed as well  Really  I mean sometimes it's non stop  Just complaining and complaining   Really similar situation for me  too  Free herb because of the lifestyle I was living   First time being sober for x mas in 8 years  Thanks   so true about the hangovers   it wouldn't be uncommon or me to have a 2 or 3 day hangover   Thanks   the shame and half remembered incidents are hard to deal with   and when someone would tell me what I did I had no choice to believe them  Sign me up please Yuuuup  Definitely nice that I didn't have to blow a crazy amount of money like a lot of people on here say over the years  but that free availability was also a major contributor to how out of hand my habit was getting  I know it was time to take a break because I've barely craved it at all since I stopped  It'll be interesting getting back to real life after the holidays though because while I'm still planning on not smoking for several more weeks  it's pretty much unavoidable that I'll have to handle and be around bud every day for the next several months   I get the meaning  but every time I see one of these posts I'm like  "but I'm not drinking "  I am not a clever man  Heya neighbor  Sober here in MN  No booze  only water tonight  and tomorrow too  There are harder battles out there as far as addiction go  But a lifestyle change is much harder to achieve than abstaining  You have to change your routines people and places  If you only hang with people who burn constantly try and find some new groups to branch out  If for nothing else being able to achieve a goal of self control will give you resolve to make more positive changes  Thanks for the great replies   much appreciated here   For the next couple of weeks   r cripplingalcoholism is participating in our yearly

for the observed NY day for me though  Hey  thanks for the hint  I'm so sorry  mistakes like these don't usually happen to me  I was just very drunk and barely able to communicate in my native language  Not even close to being the same      Try reading all the positive stories sometime then point me to the positive stories of shooting up dope  You are a fucking idiot  Yup I'm a sales man that doesn't do sales      What's "julomte"  Is that a slur against Germans  I've always found it funny that the only things more varied than names for Germany  you know  Tyskland  Alemana etc  are slurs against us  The Polish have lots of good ones  Then again  we haven't been on our best behavior exactly recently  Yeah with that it's not a problem  I actually prefer I keep at it  I'm in pain 24 7 and it helps plus has other benefits and zero negative impact on my life only positive  What's the problem again  Hi there   I find it very difficult when I feel that I don't receive the support I believe I deserve  and it becomes very easy to use that as justification for my own actions   whether that's drinking  or being grumpy  or whatever   But there is only so much I can control  and there are things beyond my control   y partner drinks  and that is beyond my control   He doesn't know what I'm experiencing from day to day  and that is also beyond my control   How I react to it is not beyond my control   So  I try to understand why he might be frustrated with me  and why I get frustrated with him   I try to empathise with him instead of expecting him to empathise with me   And I take action to address my depression   I am seeing a counsellor  I take time to myself  even if that means getting up earlier while he is in bed so I can have some peaceful time to calibrate myself for the day    I don't believe we can change the people around us  but we can change the way we respond to them     By blaming someone else for my actions or my illness  whether that's my depression or my alcohol abuse  I am not only giving control over to them  I am trying to absolve myself of my own responsibilities   You have a lot of options at your disposal   you could decide to end your marriage  to drink and blame her  to seek individual counselling  to drink and blame yourself  to not drink and work through it     So many choices are open to to   that's a wonderfully empowering thing   I hope things work out for you  and I will not drink with you today  Yeah I'll try LOL   Are you a guilty pleasure type of drunk as well  I only ever listen to 80s stuff when trashed  I wasn't even alive  I was like minus ten for that decade  I didn't explicitly say you were  I merely implied it  okay  marketer  Not much difference between marketing and sales  They both serve sales  so yes  you are a salesman even if you're not making any money from it  merely for promoting a specific sales outlet with that URL  Learning how to be vulnerable has been extremely challenging for me in my recovery  I'd encourage you to check out some of Brene Brown's work  her books and TED talks are a great place to start   Vulnerability can be really difficult but is definitely an important skill to work on   This is amazing  You should be so happy with yourself  I went to one AA meeting last week  and will be going again tomorrow   It was nerve wracking on the walk in but totally worth it  I listen to 60's Classic Rock and 80's Classic Pop  hahaha nice mix   That song I ALWAYS listen to Life in a Northern Town  For some reason when its one of these its Always the second on I Play  Most likely cause my you tube on phone shows uplike that for pre viewed videos on my phone Watford are in trouble indeed   What video games   good work  I'm still trying to break the 2 month mark  You glow  girl     see what I did there     That's awesome  it's great to get that kind of unsolicited feedback  and to know that the changes happening inside the mind and body also show on the outside   Congrats  and happy new year to you  I find that I get a headache around the 5 day mark  Could be withdrawal  or could be unrelated  Your body is under stress during the first leg of quitting  so it could be stress related as well  Usually just whatever I'm playing normally that has multiplayer and we make our own rules for it to be a drinking game  Mario Party and fighting games are also really good go to games  What's your favorite 80s song then  I'm really prone to Africa by Toto   Anyway  currently off work for the next week  vacation  and just getting smashed ad 8 45 am european time  Might get some coke later  Just nice to have someone to talk to  I cut back on my drinking significantly since August with many sober nights and unless I have been very hangover I also feel sober nights are a drag and boring af  I try to go to the gym till late  stop by YMCA for a hot tub and sauna  then watch TV  browse reddit  SD can be motivating although it gets too much sometimes   Some night I try to catch a late movie or go to a hookah bar cause you can't drink there  I am "fortunate" in a way that I can pick up night shifts at work and this way avoid drinking cause I am working till late  Hydration isn't as simple as drinking lots of water  your body also needs supplies of certain minerals  such as sodium and potassium  aka electrolytes  in order to retain fluids  Potassium is certainly one that can be depleted from alcohol use  Ideally you get these from diet  but there are drinks you can get from the pharmacy that are specially formulated for the specific task of hydration  If you can't get to a pharmacy  look for some of those brightly coloured sports drinks with "isotonic" on the label    TL DR  'lytes  The same way I know that listening to Styx didn't turn your hair grey  music can't do that  No one can make you feel any way  and the only person who can make you drink is   you      Probably 99  of addicts  at one time or another  have blamed someone else for all that's wrong in their lives  I can't really guess at how many sober addicts continue to blame others  but I'm sure it's less than 99   Whether it's 20  or 80   though  doesn't really matter  What does matter is that those who do stop blaming others have a much better chance of making it  at least according to what I've seen   Best of luck  I will not drink with you tonight The trick is to get so drunk you don't give a fuck  Well  at least until the fear kicks in  It is strange that Your digestive issues are showing up at Day 15   Is it possible that You have caught a flu bug or ate something that isn't agreeing with You   I just checked out the side effects of bupropion and gastrointestinal issues are listed     Years ago  I was trying to quit smoking cigs and the Dr gave me bupropion and I thought I had caught a really bad bug  I didn't want to smoke cigs but I was so sick I couldn't go to work   I had friends that took the same drug to quit smoking and yes  they felt sick in their tummy too but not as sick as me  I went off the pills and my belly health returned   This is my second attempt at quitting weed   The first time  I did cold turkey and man  was I ever sick   I couldn't eat and if I did  I threw it right back up   I had diarrhea and cramps and felt really bad   These symptoms started on the first day of my quit and got steadily worse for about a week and then started to taper   That is why I think Your problem might be caused by the prescription drug      When I quit this time I seriously cut back on the amount I smoked and delayed my first toke later each day   It worked really well for me   I had one or two days at the beginning of my quit that my belly felt off but other than a loss of appetite and the need to stick to mainly soups rather than full meals    my belly issues are very mild  Long story short            please consider that it might be the drug you are taking and not actually the withdrawals  Huge Congratulations on Day 15      That Sissoko reminds me of a frightened horse on a frozen lake   he's so ungainly  lol  Newcastle is certainly coming back up   you've got a team much better than a lot of Premier league teams this season       PAWS     Ah  I wasn't really asking for medical help   just what people have experienced at my level of drinking and or substance abuse  Experiences and maybe some support and guidance is all I was really after  I understand that this isn't a place that can provide actual medical advice At the moment  Keep on loving You   R E O Speedwagon   Enjoy vacation  Ah youth is wasted on the young  Call me ignorant on the matter but the fact that she's in NA  has supposed to been off opiates for over a year now  and has never made mention of this stuff once to me  meaning she's trying to keep it hidden  tells me that the dosage or amount she's using doesn't really matter  Clearly she's being secretive about it and shouldn't be doing something like this to begin with    Under my old username I saw the saga  Fuck her  congratulations of the new toy to obsess over  it's always nice    I currently wait on mine hand and foot obsessed with the cock he won't allow me to handle  hoping one day I will get it again    NY is beautiful I have been there a few times  Got my first tattoo on some sketchy place in St  Marks place to impress a girl I had a horrible  HORRIBLE obsession with when I was sixteen    I can only imagine have a thousand tornados of real NY emotional all around me in the frigid NY air  You lucky fucker    I'm so glad you are doing well  I'm not sure this was you forgive me if I am wrong but wasn't it you who had the YouTube video of you dancing in a robe with your back like a vagina    It's been a lot of drinks since then    Edit  never had real ramen  what comes in it    B how did you watch the movie  netflix or TV  Looked it up and really wanna watch it  Thanks dude  I posted in stopdrinking  but the mods flagged my post as asking for medical advice    so that sucks  Mostly I'm just desperate for guidance from similar experiences  not like an actual withdrawal walk through  Edit  for example  your post was perfect  Super helpful  Thank you so so much  A way out and somebody to just like shine the torch in the dark and be all like "Hey  Over here  this way " is all I'm really looking for haha No more porn for me  i do not need it  good luck all  Well that's a pretty good one   Hey you're active on the opiates sub as well right  Good to know  because I recently got like 9 days off the dope  I mean I still shoot coke but that's better than heroin at least   Also which time zone are you in  Just unusual to have someone reply to me at this hour  I always thought it sucked this sub was mostly American  we're like 6 hours apart at the least  Character cannot be developed in ease and quiet  Only through experience of trial and suffering can the soul be strengthened  ambition inspired  and success achieved   Helen Keller  You're a fucking saleman  I prefer idiots  Ah  I wasn't really trying to seek medical advice  Mostly I was just curious to hear from people who may have experience with my level of drinking and or substance abuse  What to expect  Any sort of resource that may have helped them as well  That sort of thing  Thank you so much  Will do   Jan 8th is 9 years for me hopefully  Thank you   Almost 3am  Im off work for anothr week or so  Been drinking etc all day night  You know  What your gonna be doing  It's spam  I reported it  I urged using doctors instead and he called me an idiot  He's not a fellow addict  just an asshole trying to make a buck and not being forthcoming about it  You should report it  Alcoholism for me was a disease of selfishness  It did not matter the risks I put on my job or life  being hungover drunk for work  because I could function  People had a hard time discerning between the two besides the fact that I was more social  outgoing  and adventurous when I was influenced or recently influenced    My biggest advice is find a reason to quit  I ended up slipping on ice  bouncing my head of the sidewalk and saved by the police  I realized I'm just endangering myself  I didn't think I drank more than usual and I probably didn't  but things got out of hand obviously   After waking up in detox because of a high BAC  which I asked NOT to know   the doctor told me he couldn't tell if I was acting strange because of the high alcohol content or head trauma  Throughout the next week  I decided I wanted more to life  I want to have goals of travel  hobbies  probably leather work or wood working   and become the fun me while sober  Or at least find out the best of sober me   TL dr if you want to quit find a reason to quit  We all thought we were functioning alcoholics  He's a bizarre player  Capable of being top level class  just never bothers to do so    Look forward to seeing who will be joining us this window  Worried that complacency   the last thing anyone needs in the Championship is starting to set in  Rafa will know this  If I can do it  you can too  I needed a plan though and here are the main things that worked for me   1  Committing to 30 days without alcohol to evaluate   2  Checking in every day and writing these five words  I will not drink today  This has the effect of quieting the 'can't wait until beer o'clock' voice in the old lizard brain   3  When the 'just one drink' thoughts come along  play that tape forward  It was hardly ever just one for me   4  Dry people  dry places  I had to change my routine to change my habits  Going to the pub as an activity had to stop   5  Find other activities you enjoy  My 2 main ones are cycling and playing the trombone   6  Enjoy the success of reaching early milestones  A day  a week  a month  90 days  180 days are all special  It's important to remember however that each of us only ever has today  I might have strung a year together but I'm still only an arm's length away from my next drink  Thankfully the urge to drink has gone  so it's unlikely I'll be picking up anytime soon   I will not drink with you today      You are a fucking idiot    This is your go to method for convincing yourself that you have won an argument  word for word  You are the idiot here  insulting us baselessly  copying your stock insult  promoting a substance that has no actual basis in generally accepted science   Regardless  I am not even opposed to Kratom  I'm pretty tempted to try it  honestly  but I won't buy it from you  This is obvious spam  You'll be lucky if you aren't IP banned site wide  And these people want  15 an hour   hahahahahahahaha Haha  Is this your subtle way of proposing or something  Im a former CA and I run Ultra Marathons now  Ill run my

something I am very very familiar with   Before I stopped drinking I found myself lying about drinking a lot  and for no good reason   Lying about having dropped a bottle  so I didn't have to admit that I'd actually completely finished it   hiding bottles  pretending to myself that no one else would have noticed that I was drinking two drinks for every one they had   And I lie about other stuff too  inconsequential stuff  it made no sense at all  And  if I'm honest  incredibly important stuff too   And goodness me it is exhausting   But  we're here now  sober you and sober me   Not drinking today  so no need to lie   THAT is exhilarating   And it gets better each day   every day that I am further away from that sneaky  deceitful  untrustworthy person  I feel more like my real self   It's good  and I don't want to give that up   Take care  and I will not drink with you today  I feel your experience  My last drink was March 3  2015 at 10 00  Because at 10 15 I experienced a stroke  I'm 45  getting sober and trying to well while still trying to have a life is difficult  Self centeredness and ego is part of my defects I am trying to rid of  Acceptance of starting life over is where I started   It's spam  He probably doesn't even use Kratom  That URL he provided is a sales site  Report it as spam  please  I am going to cut and paste a response I made to someone else just now  they are married  but the general gist seems to fit here as well   I hope it's useful to you  if not  feel free to ignore it       Hi there  I find it very difficult when I feel that I don't receive the support I believe I deserve  and it becomes very easy to use that as justification for my own actions   whether that's drinking  or being grumpy  or whatever  But there is only so much I can control  and there are things beyond my control  My partner drinks  and that is beyond my control  He doesn't know what I'm experiencing from day to day  and that is also beyond my control  How I react to it is not beyond my control  So  I try to understand why he might be frustrated with me  and why I get frustrated with him   I try to empathise with him instead of expecting him to empathise with me  And I take action to address my depression  I am seeing a counsellor  I take time to myself  even if that means getting up earlier while he is in bed so I can have some peaceful time to calibrate myself for the day   I don't believe we can change the people around us  but we can change the way we respond to them  By blaming someone else for my actions or my illness  whether that's my depression or my alcohol abuse  I am not only giving control over to them  I am trying to absolve myself of my own responsibilities  You have a lot of options at your disposal   you could decide to end your marriage  to drink and blame her  to seek individual counselling  to drink and blame yourself  to not drink and work through it  So many choices are open to to   that's a wonderfully empowering thing  I hope things work out for you  and I will not drink with you today  Please be super careful and don't cold turkey    Know that a lot of what you're feeling is a result of drinking   Before I quit  I had a terrible case of panic disorder  depression  suicidal tendencies and paranoia    It has been a crazy ride  and sometimes not easy  but never not worth it    Life's great sober  and if I could get sober  then you most certainly can    Always here to chat if you need   What a huge achievement  guys   Congratulations  you inspire all of us   You've made several incorrect assumptions about my beliefs  That's OK  I don't mind  Just sayin'   This post is spam  OP's  not yours   Note the URL at the end of their post  don't go there  it is a sales site  I reported it as spam and I urge you to do the same and make your own independent assessment of Kratom without paying any attention to this spammer  If you think you can safely go back you don't understand addiction    The good thing about Europe is that it's so easy to get around quickly  I liked Austria for this reason  We were heading back west  then decided to completely change our mind and go to Eastern Europe on a spur of the moment  Doing that in the States would be a nightmare   Don't fret there's plenty of time to visit yet  If you really cared about people recovering  you wouldn't be such an asshole  Report this spammer  guys  This   sub is going to shit   subs' moderators are very concerned about sales and promotional posts like this  Maybe time to taper down  I feel ya  see my one and only post   We appear to be in the same boat  a decade of drinking  functioning but deeply unfulfilled  The going to bed sober thing    We are robbing ourselves of our most creative thoughts and it's tragic  Good luck  I'm right here with you friend  Going to do my best to stay sober 2017  Been sleeping absolutely terribly these past 2 nights  and thinking pretty much constantly about alcohol   We can do this  Sign me up  Yeah that's true    taper  lol what's that  I've tried the whole tapering deal before but just ended up slamming them beers Speaking of intuition   I just woke up from the weirdest dream ever  In reality today we were talking about how our boss had made reference to all forms of addiction as "demons" and while not religious she said that it really does seem like that is what alcohol is for her  The boss feels like it's a form of possession in the literal sense  but okay neither of us are really sure about that one  Where we work  I work 3rd shift and she works 1st so I see her every morning for a about 15 minutes and we exchange information so even when we were arguing and she was going downhill really fast and I broke contact outside of just our professional relationship and saying what had to be said day in day out   we held it together enough to do that  One day I did text her after work and told her she smelled so badly of alcohol it literally filled up the room so she might want to get a hold of that   whatever  Anyway  let me not regress  Okay  so    the dream  I dreamt we were in bed and I told her I was considering having sex again  She told me she had to go to sleep  So I said okay and as I was getting out of bed she rolled over and she had three mouths  The one on top was her regular mouth and it told me she was scared  the other was her vagina and that mouth said she wanted to and I was about to go through a major "shift storm" and the third was a demon mouth and it said "follow me" Anyway   I just woke up from that nap  It wasn't terrifying  but it was definitely not a warm and fuzzy feeling  Anyway  I'm just going to play it by ear  Another thing she has told me is that she drinks to not have feelings  That may have already been mentioned  All I do know is that since she has stopped drinking and the pressure has lifted we are actually having fun talking again  She's not the obnoxious drunk  or the sad sack newly sober  The second part just may be part of the depression process   Also  something I forgot to mention was that something else that seemed to have contributed to the spiral when she was drinking was that she started taking lexapro  That seemed to make it worse automatically   The epitome for me is when I try to justify that the price of alcohol  as if it's a necessary expense  but cut back on other things like quality food  I can't leave my command at the moment  I am on restriction  Not even suppose to have access to the internet  Thank you so much for this  The idea of not having to be that person anymore really is amazing  I'm not quite up to being exhilarated yet   Your words really touched me and I am so grateful that we are not drinking today  I had the exact same issue in the first few months  I wrote out what I was ashamed about  It helped a lot to spew it  Kept inside  those secrets would grow into horrible character flaws that I'd assume we're permanent  Talking with other sobernauts helps a lot  too   Remember  too  that you've been addicted to a toxic  mind breaking substance  The person that came out when I drank was and is not me  That's not an all encompassing excuse  rather a reminder that you deserve forgiveness even if you don't think your alter ego does  Hey friend  hope you're doing well  Only a full day in myself  best of luck  We can do this   I understand you're in a negative place right now  but I hope you will see in time that you do have options   The people on this sub are here and willing to offer support and advice if you want it    There is a wealth of experience here  and I find it incredibly humbling to know that people are prepared to take time out to offer me  an internet stranger  their perspective and experience    I am not sure you want that  which is okay too   I hope you get to where you want to be be  I really do  Why did you decide enough is enough after so long  Hey bro  day 2 here and very similar back story  We didn't come to this conclusion by accident  that switch has been flicked and now it's up to us to keep it down  You can and will beat this  You know you don't want to go back  You know how you feel when clear and when not  You've made the right choice  you got this     a support group might be helpful  Fair enough   Maybe you can find an in person support group using Google     once I get a car and can drive myself to appointments I'll look into the other options  My insurance plan  part of the Canadian medicare system  pays doctors  a lot  to travel to meet patients   They can do house calls  or maybe even meet patients in a park or coffee shop near the patient's home  or maybe even see the patient in the doctor's car  if the patient needs more privacy than a park can afford    Doctors in my country still generally prefer for patients to come to them  though  it's still more profitable for them in the end   Maybe you could get Medicaid or Obamacare   Maybe those plans also pay for doctors to travel     I don't want to rely on my parents to drive me  Are there buses in your city   If not   do you have a bicycle  Well we are here on stopgaming not gaming in moderation  I do have a gf  but it's not always possible to have sex  For example she's on her period this week  and I'm not into having period sex  Some people are    Sometimes she's not around  Sometimes I'm travelling  Could be many things  But since masturbation  in moderation  is healthy  what's the problem      Sign me up please I'd go after Will Hughes     I've said this before  and I repeat it because I think it needs to be said  The first few days will suck ass  be prepared for it  For you will be grouchy  sick  have no appetite  yet you'll be hungry    Eat small amounts of soup  or Huel   and have little to no energy    That   will   go away  The cravings will stick around for longer    I'm battling them at the moment   If you can take a few days off work  do  but stay in contact with people who know you personally  If you can  tell them what you are doing   Yeah Kratom withdrawal weighs so heavily on my mind  it scares the fucking piss out of me  The last time that I detoxed off Kratom I actually checked myself into the hospital phsyc ward   And I checked myself into the physc ward the time before that too   For me  the transition from my 'Kratomed' self  back to my clean self is really dark  The hospital gave me a safe place  and comfort meds  Gabapentin is amazing for withdrawal  Hell yeah  that  is  a victory  Reclaiming our bodies from the drawn out poisoning we've put them through should always count as a victory in my book  Well done  you  And congrats on Day 35  Have a beautiful day  Cookie    I would say they were just regular dreams  nothing special about them really  Once I quit though they turned into constant nightmares  A lot of them would actually be great ideas for horror movies or games  for a while I was typing them out but I ended up deleting it when family came to visit  Very rarely I'll have a nice dream  maybe like once a month  Five months doesn't sound long  Yes it does  You're killing it  well done  It is a great thing to be able to say these words to a group of people that fully understands what you are going through and what you are looking for in life  We have your back and you have our back that is how this works  I never considered myself an alcoholic and deep down I sometimes feel that I am doing this for my health and financial reasons  But the fact is that I have no use for 1 drink but would prefer 10 or more says something  I'm glad your here and look forward to seeing you around here   Thank you so much for your comment  I didn't really expect anyone to comprehend the scattered words and everything about my story being pieced together by emotions   I'm not particularly concise and sharp   I'm really glad that you made the decision   Your decision Will impact my life significantly  The bread was delicious  I'm starting a Keto diet soon  so I'm indulging a little with pies and cereals and all   I hope you feel neutral  and choose to be above that sometimes   I hope you feel completely whole  by yourself   Thanks again     3  Awww  you too Eligiac  do you know I had to google that word   it's lovely    Have a great day  Because you cannot survive on your own on less than that nowadays  It's called  livable wages   People literally cannot survive on full time fast food or WalMart pay  They can't pay rent or buy food or raise their kids or go to school even though they work their asses off getting shit on every day by people like you   Have a bit less alcohol every day to keep withdrawal down   slowly get out of it   Take a break for however long  before ya do it all over again  I was there  I thought Kratom was a miracle when I was  You'll hate it when you're back on the street again  trust me    which I'd bet my life on unless you give up opiates entirely   This was actually a little triggering for me  as the last game I played  I stopped about a week ago   was wow  But then  I also can relate to those things she said about needing an excuse to quit  I was never an advanced player  I never even got to that part where you get to the latest content and grind etc    but when I got a lot of in game money from my brother to kick off my new character  I felt like I somehow owe him and so I have to continue playing  Sunk cost fallacy  But then I decided that I can just lie that I quit only because I have to study   which is certainly one of the reasons  Also a couple of days later my computer died  so that's the end of the problem   Too bad she didn't point them here instead of r nowow  we're a lot more active  I'm so glad that you've comer this far   D I'm not even excited for reaching 15 days  I'm just marvelling all this progress   It makes me feel a buzz I lost in alcohol   I hope you find that feeling that makes you roll around in bed  too self aware to sleep in  Sing a song as you walk towards the window with a glass of water or whatever you enjoy  and giving the philosophical sigh that you no longer need a bottle of amnesia   I will not drink with you today    3  Oh for fuck sakes it's exhausting holding up the facade of being a normal drinker when deep down I want all the booze  It's quite freeing once the chains of alcohol are removed  It's hard but I can see clearly why I want a different life  Im glad you are here and look forward to sharing victories in our battle against the asshole alcohol   I've been listening to this all morning  It's scared the shit out of me  Thank you so much  Ok  so here's the thing now    now  WE'VE got this   D Thanks for making me aware of relapse signs  I have been craving  I do have alcohol in my home  Haven't done it so far   I hope to keep it this way   Thanks  I love you  I see where you're coming from   I think that any choice you make if you make it  is empowering   I see it as the difference between letting things happen to you  and deciding what course things take   I'm afraid I'm not sure I understand what you're seeking here  so I don't think I am being very helpful to you     I hope you find what you're looking for  and in the meantime  please take care of yourself  Alcohol is probably the biggest hurdle when quit smoking  Good Job  Loperamide is Imodium  As to the social aspect  it is well proven that behaviors are catching  both positive and negative  So maybe right now your entire social life revolves around alcohol  But if you opt out of that system and create new social events  you may find a lot of friends follow you  I have noticed when I do not drink  my family is much more likely to drink less or even not drink at all  temporarily    I doubt anime is a great idea but beside that I completely agree  wow   Yay  Isn't it wonderful that you don't have to worry about people noticing  and judging  your drinking   Cookie also said one of the options at your disposal is to try individual counseling  Counseling to help you work on processing your own problems and feelings can be incredibly helpful  even if your wife isn't able to be supportive to you in the way you need right now  Even just going to two individual counseling appointments has helped me enormously  It allows me to get objective feedback to put things in perspective for me  and a way to learn new coping skills to deal with my problems and feelings without using alcohol   The truth is  things  can  get better if you're willing to make some changes to your situation  If you're not getting the support you need from your wife  it's up to you to seek support somewhere else  But  if nothing changes  then nothing changes  Best wishes to you     Welcome Spiral   Stick with it  your future self will thank you for it  Scream you live off the generosity of others  Without that you are Fucked  I would think you would be in favour of living wages     Congratulations on a year and Happy New Year too  Jax or Mango  Sign me up please  Thank you for this  End of day 18 here  Hope you're still doing well  Great on Football Manager  but I think not athletic enough for the PL  He seems to tire easily then go missing  Also we're pretty well stocked in attacking playmakers   Benitez will probably make a couple of loan signings out the blue  Have a hunch we may lose Perez or Mitrovic though  No great loss  providing Gayle is fit  Yeah  that could be or it might be those random drug tests at work and the pot  which is still illegal in most places  stays there way longer  while the legal alcohol is gone in like 12 hours or something  Not sure  but I concur with your observation   To me  the ultimate drug are the good feelings the mind releases when you achieve things in life or do something good for another  I think I'm addicted to whatever chemicals are behind those feelings     Have you ever tried seeing a counselor or therapist  Congratulations  You are where I want to be in 364 days  Well done   I've experienced similar benefits to not drinking also  My income is up  weight is down and relationship better too   I raise my coffee to a further 12 months   one day at a time of course     Hey friend  might a suggest that you find yourself a good psychologist   therapist  I started seeing one a while ago and there is a lot of shit that we do   think but don't know why  My therapist has helped me to understand a lot of my issues come down to being very sick as a kid any carrying that trauma through teenage years and adulthood  I firmly believe that everyone should see a therapist  even for a tune up every now and then  We service our cars  computers and other machines  but most people never service the most complex machine that we have  our heads  I guess what I'm saying is  is that it's ok to not know how to do shit and there are people out there who can help  Hopefully that helps   Mango    I've used mascara and lip gloss so I'm in no place to judge and also hopefully no one ever borrowed my makeup in high school   Hughes could work in a sort of Pirlo esque quarterback midfield position  Benitez turned Xabi Alonso into this type of player at Liverpool   but I see your point    Hopefully you keep Ayoze Perez  he looks class   i am with you Don't worry about other people   Save yourself   Suppose it's good to see the CA tradition of wasting plant life is continuing into the new year  Thanks a lot for your advice  I will not drink with you tonight     Yes I did it     And man  I woke up feeling really good     Totally worth feeling shitty last night  Thank you so much guys  I want to be a mom too  a sober mom as well   You a're amazing for putting yourself first  to watch her become herself   3 Same here man  I followed about 1000  "Instagram Models" and scrolled endlessly through my feed and just be enslaved to their bodies  Good for you  Welcome to the club   Unsure to be honest  Taking each day as it comes I suppose  Any advice   Thank you for the advice   I am so determined to do this   Thank you x  Choose life  Choose a fucking big glass of soda  Choose driving in the middle of the night without endangering others  Choose a light snack while waiting  Choose an evening of good memories rather than a night of regrets  Choose knowing what you're doing every day  Choose community upliftment over self loathing  Choose happiness  Choose a programme that works for you  Choose jogging  Fitness  Longevity  Fun  Choose not waking up in public places  Choose not getting into fights you don't remember  Choose health  Choose family  Choose life   If it's right in front  could you try a headband look   I've tried   I pull right underneath it      Also  your therapist whoever is treating you sounds kind of lousy  Could you see someone else who might be able to give you a different approach   I had to stop seeing that one because she was a part of a program that I finished   My most recent therapist was absolutely horrible  he told me that BPD didn't exist  that I loved chaos  and that no one "normal" would ever associate with me if I told them I have PTSD  BPD  or trich    So now I'm looking for someone   It sucks because it's so hard to find someone who will work with all 3 of those   Many therapists won't treat someone with BPD   The ones that do tend to be in structured programs  like the one I finished   My most recent therapist treated PTSD but not BPD or trich   Last therapist treated BPD and learned about trich  but couldn't help with PTSD     but now I have a new spot on the back  so I don't know how much it really helped   I'm also worried about that   I always find a way   When I plucked out my widow's peak  I started pulling next to it         Your local meeting list     The January February meeting list for the St  Louis  St  Charles  Metro East  and Mid East areas is  here  http   stlna org wp content uploads 2016 12 January February 2017 pdf     Meeting lists change very slowly  but they do change over time   After February ends  future meeting lists will be uploaded to  here  http   stlna org find a meeting           Choosing a meeting     For the first meeting you go to  choose an "open" meeting  not a "closed" meeting   Most of the meetings in your city are open   Look at the parenthetical remarks next to each meeting's zip code   " O W " means that a meeting is open and wheelchair accessible   " O " means that it's open   " C W " means that it's closed and wheelchair accessible   The full legend is on the first page of the meeting list   The first time you go to a meeting  try to choose a meeting with a significant contingent of women and or young people   Consider going to "Women and Men Do Recover"  Sundays   "Women of Unconditional Love"  Mondays   "Young at Heart"  Tuesdays   "Hugs not Drugs"  Wednesdays   or "Little Girl Grows Up"  Wednesdays    You can search for meetings by name  and find maps and end times   here  http   stlna org find a meeting     Not all of the meetings I mentioned by name are in St  Louis   If you have trouble finding the room where the meeting will actually be  ask venue staff  or phone all four of the help lines listed in the meeting list   Or try phoning me   I'm not in St  Louis but may be able to advise you   I'll PM you my phone number   Or hang around the venue parking lot or the building itself   Look for people arriving  especially right before the meeting start time   Ask them where the meeting is        Going to the meeting     You can bring friends and or your boyfriend with you to open meetings  but not to closed meetings   If at all possible  arrive ten or fifteen minutes early  You'll be one of the first people to arrive  Say hi to people  introduce yourself  and tell them it's your first meeting   After the meeting  hang around and introduce yourself to more people   Maybe a large contingent goes to some coffee shop every week after the meeting  you can ask whether or not this is true   During the meeting itself  you don't have to give any speeches   But you'll be expected to say a one sentence introduction   Say something like "Hi  I'm Rockaford  and I'm a guest " or "Hi  I'm Rockaford  and this is my first time here "  If you're asked to speak any more  you can either speak or say "pass"        Conclusion     If you do go to a meeting  please let us know how it goes   You can make a new top level text post in  r RedditorsInRecovery or  r StopSelfHarm  then reply to this comment and provide me with a link to the post   Or you can just reply to this comment directly with your thoughts  Perez is good but hardly essential to the squad  Plus is probably our most valuable asset  15 20m would be hard to turn down   As for Spurs    sad to see that Gazza has gone loopy again  A shared club legend  seemingly back on the self destruct mode  The day after my brothers wedding he met him in a quayside hotel bar  Bought them three bottles of champagne after a brief interaction  Otherwise kept himself to himself  drinking quietly at the bar   Kinda sad  but also kinda awesome   Welcome  There is no universal experience but in my experience more often than not it only gets worse and goes deeper    You're still early in the process  Chances are your withdrawal symptoms will pass in a few days tops  Taper though or go to a doctor  because you never know  I'm not saying quit forever I'm just saying take a damn break    Or just keep drinking  No judgement here for that  But no  in case you're wondering  from this point on it doesn't get any more fun   Yay  Thanks for sharing    Back up after falling asleep early  I didn't drink with you last night   I am a first day as well  I understand your story so well  I just need to add the "secret" drinking part    Been drinking for 20 years or so  on and off  more on though   This is the first time i feel ready to conquer this beast called alcohol  With you and all the others on this forum I am reassured I can stop drinking for ever  A fresh new sober live     easier to NOT drink the first one than it is to NOT drink the second one   "  It's to keep track of how many days I haven't smoked  If I start on odd days I lose track and I prefer not to  I'm doing na and looking into a relapse prevention group  I'm going as far as possible this time  I'll work as hard as I have to  Ok  Then find a better job  Minimum wage is supposed to be entry level while you're going to school and what not  not something you make a career out of once your of age to start working by begging for a higher wage  If they work their asses off  they can do the same in a different field  The problem is they make simple mistakes constantly and still demand higher wages that surpasses a lot of actual important jobs that support and help the community  lets say  an EMT worker who on average starts around that same amount and their job is more sophisticated in that they're are saving lives    I'm not trying to say that I'm all that  I'm just server  but it makes ends meet  with funds still to spare  If you're not happy with what you do  as in not make enough  find something else  It's simple     Well done  I've enjoyed your posts over the months  and am glad as can be that you're Mr  Year now  Good on ya  Thanks  I'm in  Quit smoking most of 2014 and 15  was able to run half marathons and beyond as a result  Stupidly started again once I hurt my back and wasn't able to run  Yesterday was my day one again  That's awesome  very strong of you mate  Congrats  I put my work pants on after 2 months of no work and drinking   arrrgh  Looking forward to feeling slim  Solution   Germany has fuck tons of saunas  Go to one  sweat out the booze  take a plunge in the pool  then hydrate  Eat a nice sausage afterwards  maybe some pickled cabbage too   Reward oneself for feeling 10 X better with a few beers  That's awesome  I agree those early mornings are sweet  This is bullshit  YOU ended up back on the street after kratom because YOU were not done yet  Please do not project your weakness onto other people  Abstanance is your route to freedom  For some kratom is that route  Leave your failures out of other people's lives   But that's just how it is  Tim  Yes it all depends on the generosity of the public but that's my job to provide good and knowledable service and I'm golden for what I need financially   Of course I dont want to do this forever  I'm at least aiming for being a bartender  and even then if nothing better than that comes up my path  they still make even way more than what they need   No worries  it's always good to vent and your story was both helpful to me and I hope many other people who stumble upon this thread  Stories like this communicate experiences and emotion which can be helpful to yourself and many others  so don't feel bad for jumping in  I appreciate it  All the best to you in 2017   I believe in you  Keep quitting until you've quit  You can do it  Welcome buddy  Check in here often and keep the motivation up  Some awesome stories here to inspire you  Congrats on a YEAR   It's weird how we're left with these permanent reminders  like when you hurt your hand  I fractured my ribs a couple years ago while drunk and till this day  whenever I get a twinge there  all the bad memories come rushing back    I like how you discussed the advantages and results of sobriety  very inspirational  Thanks for sharing     Lmao yes  because the economy is excellent    I have more education than you and I work two shitty part time jobs and I'm still broke because I'm in a small town and the opportunities just aren't there  I don't have a family to help me out like you did through your DUI  Mine threw me out on my ass with nothing before I ever even did anything wrong  stole my vehicle  caused me to lose my good job  etc    It's not as simple as "just find something else"  You take what you have for granted     Sign me up  Congratulations BadToTheTrombone  I've been looking forward to this post   very proud of you    I'm in GMT   5 I think and up  east coast us   Attempts at moderation were nothing but anxiety inducing for me  Not picking up at all is far simpler   One day about 11 months ago I sat and thought about moderation  By this point I knew I didn't want to get drunk any longer  I'd more than had enough of it  So I tried figuring out what is so appealing about only having one or two drinks  It can only be taste  so surely it's easier for me to find non alcoholic drinks I like the taste of   So that's what I did    That realisation was like opening the shutters on a beautiful spring morning and letting the sunshine in  Hey TheNewTap   welcome  glad you're posting  and hi from Talie from the chat    I'm a teacher myself   I agree  it's a great decision  Teaching has become so much easier and more rewarding since getting sober     As far as "first days" advice goes  eat anything you want  Drink lots of water  Always have a tasty non alcoholic drink to hand in situations where you'd usually have been consuming alcohol  Check in with your doctor if you're at all worried  I see you're doing that   good call     Be kind to yourself  Do what you need to do to get through  B vitamins might be a good idea  And as you know   hop into the chat if you need to talk about anything at all    Enjoy that art gallery  and congratulations on getting started    Talie PLANTS  I LIKE THEM   Congratulations  Here's to 5 months more   i'm in my 15th day still have dizziness gerd but the depression have greatly reduced compared to the 1st and 2nd week  my doc give me dogmatil 3 days ago and my stomach starting to calm down but still can't find solution for my dizziness and fatigue I read Pants  Hope you wear them  Fantastic  you must feel amazing  wishing you an even more amazing year   Please only post when sober   this is explained in the  participation guidelines  https   www reddit com r stopdrinking wiki index wiki post only while sober   for this subreddit     We recognize that many people spend months "lurking" this subreddit while drinking  You are welcome to read as much as you'd like while not sober  However  for the sake of everyone here  and for the sake of your own recovery  please only post or comment when you're sober  "Sober" means "not currently intoxicated or under the influence in any way "  In the meanwhile  there's lots of information in the posts here and lots to explore in the sidebar    You are so  so young and so  so sheltered  Not everyone has had everything in life handed to them  You don't realize that it isn't always a question of "work harder" or "get a better job " Better jobs take degrees or experience  which costs money and takes time that people can't always afford  I'm not going to waste more time talking to you about this because i know that you won't get it    I really hope that your life continues swimmingly and that you're never forced to lower yourself because thats all that is available to you  But on the other hand  you'll be a spoiled brat until you die unless that happens  So I'm torn   I haven't posted in awhile  but shit this sub is getting weak  What happened to chairs and promoting horrible life decisions  Where the fuck are the regulars  Good job  I'm planning to quit in a couple of weeks  Meanwhile  I need to figure out if I need to keep alcohol on hold or figure out ways to manage not smoking while drinking  Pussy is pussy We are with you Anongrl9  Take care of yourself  seek help if you need it   I'm not drinking with you today    Why  I hate pants   Isn't that so weird          Nooo  gets down on one knee and opens a beautifully crafted wooden box of booze  Hi   I'm a lurker who started posting today too  I also found this sub extremely helpful during my drunken days  It's doubly so during sobriety  Quitting was always a "one day" goal in the back of my mind  one day I'd register and get my badge  until life bitch slapped me and said  "No   now " I hope you're able to stop drinking before it bites you  My experience is that it will bite you eventually  Thank you  Story of my life  Longest I have gone is 18 months   Motivators for me are thinking about how shit I feel the next day  how I will waste it  probably cancel on someone  Weight lose photos and progress  buying new clothes  even blokes like to feel good  gym  outdoor adventures and just all round be ready to rumble with life and say Yes more often  I've been working towards quiting again for some months  this is it  done deal  We got this  same problem here at 24  badge reset after nye  if u are anything like me then all of your mates are heavy drinkers too and don't "understand" why i want to quit  drinking is their  and was my  normal  its hard but we can do it  I get that a lot actually  the Negasonic Teenage Warhead look   thanks  Yes indeed  it really is exhausting and alcohol is an asshole  There are atheist agnostic freethinkers meetings  Do a search for "waaft" or "aaagnostica "   Founder Bill realized later in life that he'd overdone the religious language  and said so  The book  of course  was never changed to reflect that   I'm with you  I've tried so many times to get sober in the past  I had forgotten it had even happened  but over the holidays my brother reminded me of how in October I called him drunk and depressed  saying I was sick of living    I drank on NYE  Alone  I had a 6 pack of beer to myself  I wondered what the hell I was even doing  it wasn't fun  There was no reason for it  alcohol has not done anything but destroy my life  I didn't want to be around anyone  and told everyone I was just relaxing and watching movies alone  wasn't in the party mood  But for some reason still wound up buying beer  Who does that   So yeah  for today  it's 2 30 AM here  I won't drink with you   Nope  Have had several talks about it  Best talk I've ever had about it  with regard to my parent taking some responsibility and admitting his drinking is problematic  was when I finally admitted  reluctantly  that I think I am an alcoholic and need to stop drinking  Who knew  That's one of the things I love most about SD   we have more than 55K in our army going strong  and we're there for each other each and every day  The support  kindness  sincerity and genuine compassion is incredible here   Congrats on 492 days Shine  and thank you for your friendship and kind words  Blessings to you always       Shout out to u ninjilla   many thanks for this and for all of your support and encouragement   my doctor put me on lexapro  it was a night and day change  also if you have a constant anxiety try the phone app calm com  it's free and very effective I'd recommend not fucking with xanax man  Shit fries your brain  Good on you for questioning what's going on  I know a lot of teachers and drinking is high on the cards for many being a problem  a glass here  bottle there    often  Often I'll hear a couple of them say they want to have a break  but never do  Seeing your GP is a great idea  I'm a nurse and have similar drinking habits  I found identifying the time I like to drink 4 7pm start I need to do something else  gym  youtube  family stuff  cleaning  fishing  just to break that habit time  frame  It's only day 2 for me  but i've been working towards this moment for a couple months now  Once I turned up to work still affected  it was the worst  highly embarrassing  Write your goals of why and what motivates you to succeed   Some great points from taliesinsmuse   Aww I'm so glad it did  I'm scared of my weakness  Right now I'm full of determination and visualising how my life can be sober  going for nice walks  painting again  doing my poi etc  but I know it's just one stupid moment to be back again  Hopefully I can get medication or something to help  Or find my strength here from people like you    Nice  it's so easy to see the difference sometimes  You gotta tell me about the whiteboard though  Thanks  But if I may ask  what do you think is wrong with anime  He said in his post it was something he liked  Yeah it's really bizarre  Still  feel free to hop on my sublime username      Can you remind me of my Santa's name  I have the address  and am looking for what to send them    Brings two large glasses into the room  I believe the link in the FAQ regarding non alcoholic beer is broken  It went to page not found on my Reddit mobile app  Won't get it  I totally get it  Everything that I have right now had a price to pay  losing my mom and our house I'm still fucked up from the that  Ive since been forced into the adult world  working as much as I can to make ends meet  Yes  I was spoiled when she was alive  I would get my shifts covered just so I can sit around and drink  but its a lot different now  And I'm trying to adult as best as I can  I actually pick up shifts rather than releasing mine  I honestly don't know why you keep lashing out on me  Fash   If we're not cool anymore  so be it  Hey Liverrot   this is the hardest part   and you're doing great   A minute at a time  whatever it takes  Please keep checking in  we're here for you  And I'll keep cheering you on      You're in the best place here  It seems like the whole world is drunk sometimes and having fun but you don't see the other side of it  You can message a mod for your day 1 badge and watch that number grow  and you can consider looking for other resources like counselling or AA which are helpful to some as well  I'm still reflecting on day 119  Only now  I can see many more possible and exciting paths  I've got the time and am building the discipline now to travel those paths that would've been impeded or fully blocked by a bottles of whiskey  mountains of whiskey  Best of luck to you on Day 2  You can do it  Sorry  I must not have been clear   I do take pride in the days behind   But it is the day now and the days to come where we need to focus     Congrats on your 22  Thought you may raise this  Undergarments  not trousers  If you don't it'll get chilly down there   Shouldn't you be asleep anyway  Must be what  4am where you are  Congrats  man  Great work  Washed AND waxed the car this morning  made a great breakfast  read some more of my book  and knocked out The NY Times Sunday crossword  Odd to think none of this would have been possible over any of the last twenty or so January 1's    I got a little chuckle listening to the drunk hangover tales of my friends and neighbors this morning  No thanks  Ouch   Hey Bone   Congratulations on a YEAR  As you know  I've been eagerly awaiting this post  and no  I can't hold my horses any longer lol    I read your DCI and comments every single day and I thank you for all the support and encouragement  It's a pleasure to celebrate this awesome milestone with you   raising my coffee and sending a big warm hug your way      Welcome   I'm not sure how good my advice is  but I have found that posting here  seeking and lending support  is helpful along with managing progress one day at a time   To that end  I use the daily mantra of Not Today   Good luck and welcome  Congrats on 54 days  Turtle  That's wonderful      I'm sorry for your loss  I really admire your strength in getting through this anniversary of your loved one's death  and that heartbreaking phone call  I am proud of you for getting out and seeking the support you needed  instead of giving in to sadness  or drinking again  Thank you for sharing this  Best wishes to you     Once those feelings aren't pushed down by alcohol they really make themselves known  I think I cry almost every day  thinking about what I could have done differently  where I'm going to go from here  who I actually am  But that's something I'd just be pushing down the line otherwise  You can do it  and you don't have to do it alone  your chances are pretty good now that you're here  Awesome  was unsure if dog or woman before picture loaded  then  both  Illusion of joy   You nailed it right there mate  For me drinking also made things fun  magical  awesome   reality is  no  it was the same and I'd be left deflated at the end of the drinking session and then knowing the consequences the following days with lowered mood and anxiety   Keep being honest with her  after all there's a reason you guys are together and encourage her to support you and maybe even encourage her to read about anxiety in others to get some insight it's not just you  but very common   You brought tears to my eyes  A really inspiring read  Many best wishes to you on you ongoing recovery  Will gladly not drink with you  Nice work  was a little hesitant to ask for mine at a meeting but once I had that cheap little scrap of metal in my hand it did something for me  Its just so frustrating when i hear you say stuff like fast food should be a job  while you go to school  not realizing that not everyone can afford the luxury of higher education  Some people are even forced to drop out of HIGH school to make money for their families  And before you say rhat that's because their parents are lazy  please consider that maybe their parent or parents are sick and have no health insurance because this country treats its people like shit  Or maybe they grew up in foster care and have no family to help them  Or maybe they caught some trumped up charge that makes it very very difficult to even get a good job  I just don't see you even understanding that lufe is like that for way more of the population than you'd think  And it seems to me that you think it's just a matter of "working harder" to overcome a system that is built to keep people down and to reward those on the top who do not need the help    It's ignorant and blind and honestly it is insulting  I don't know how i can show you how life is really really hard for so many people  not things like one or two bad events  but a systemic assault that beats people down day after day after day  That sounds delightful   Question though   isn't pickled cabbage just sauerkraut  PM me with your city and I'll get you in contact with your local 24hr hotline for CA or NA Good point   that next day feeling like shit  letting yourself down  letting others down   that's enough  I'm out  quit now  Hi Stillmuddy  Hang in there   if you've been sober long enough to forget how long it's been  then you're doing incredibly well  I can't pretend to know how you're feeling at this point  but it sounds like you're experiencing ennui and some degree of depression  Drinking isn't going to make that better   From where I'm standing  it seems like the best thing would be to talk to your boyfriend about what you're feeling   at the very least he might be able to accompany you to some new groups until you find somewhere comfortable    I dislike using kraut when conversing with a German  It's bad manners  It get easier  Don't lose hope  nice  Very Trainspotting    We have a white board in the kitchen  If we had heated arguments I usually was the first to fall asleep  intoxicated  and she would write her final say on there  For the longest time  when I drank alcohol  I loathed that board  Now it is usually filled with normal stuff  occasional praises hugs and kisses  Wow  that's awesome  If only I had half a brain at 24 to quit then  now 35  Congrats  Lost all your possessions  What happened  Congratulations on a year  Thanks for sharing the great news      You mentioned your age  so I'm curious if this has to do with most of the people in the meetings being older  I'm 21 and have been sober for 20 months  I got involved pretty early with YPAA  Young People in Alcoholics Anonymous   It's been a great way to meet other young people  They may also have young person's meetings where you live  I would get a hold of your Intergroup  or ask around at local clubhouses   I sometimes find it easier to share at candlelight meetings  The lack of light takes away the pressure of people staring at me   Sharing has also been difficult for me  but I've gotten more comfortable with it  The only way I found was to start short  I introduced myself as an alcoholic and then just passed  Slowly as I built some knowledge and confidence  I could add more   e  typed more That's awesome to hear   It's great for you in ways beyond just staying free   Keep going   Not today  My first 3 days were characterised by the constant feeling of missing having lost something   Don't lose hope  it gets easier  Use some willpower and prove it to yourself  Congrats on deciding to make changes for the better  Day 1 sure  does  suck  but not as bad as continuing to wake up hungover and broke sucks      I'm glad you have made plans to have lots of support going forward  bc that might just be the most important thing you could do to help you make lasting changes   Being able to enjoy your life again is absolutely worth all of the effort it takes  Looking forward to seeing you around here  and hearing about your progress  Best wishes to you     I drunkenly fell into some sort of a planter at a party I was not really invited to but tangentially showed up at on NYE  I didn't know that wasting plant life was a CA thing but glad I'm not alone    I've also killed every plant I ever owned  But  that's not as much a CA thing   The great thing is that you don't ever have to feel like this again  Happy new year  Ha interesting  Certainly could have used some better communication in my last relationship  Hey sorry you're having to deal with stressful stuff like this  I guess this is life  Good thing is you're trying to reach out to others  What kind of emotional support do you have  Can your dad help you find a therapist just so you can learn copying skills  It also helps just to have someone to talk to without them being judgemental  Anyway  I hope things get better for you  But hang in there in the meantime  I'm an atheist  What I get from AA is comfort from other people who understand my struggle  That's it  Take comfort in knowing we all struggle   Yet  we all  including you  have the power to overcome this struggle   I work on it one day at a time through the simple declaration of 'not today'    Have I stumbled   Certainly  but I think I'm becoming stronger and hopefully have identified triggers and 'defensive actions' that I can take to stem urges   Stay strong   You've got this  Haha  'Wow you look great '   'Not really  I just don't look like crap ' Nice work on keeping your streak going  Plastic wrap and a blow torch   Lol  love it  That's awesome   congrats on the success  Good job   During my first week of quitting I drank  I told myself if I get use to it at home now it will be easier when I'm outside later on   I've gotten smashed twice in a bar and didn't smoke  I guess it worked  I called this technique "quitting on hard mode"  Cacti  One of mine is 18 years old   fucking enormous now  Requires next to no care  and isn't easy to set alight  Perfect CA plant  oh just being wasted and lost a bag full of stuff somewhere  passport  keys  bank card  money  make up  clothes  my book etc     i dont a flat and i move around a lot   genuinely this is basically all i own   You can do it  thanks  yeah i am actually feeling the sense of excitement peace that annie grace was talking about  i can see more firmly than ever how breaking my sobriety for the same old night out was a waste of time   Sucks that you had to feel that  you never know when you will get tested  Hah I'm not religious at all but I can feel that vocabulary and mode of thought seeping in  Good stuff keeping on through the new year  What kind of business are you running  hey  wow congrats  do you have any tips from one 24 yo woman to another  x wow well done  congrats  you're doing great     Congrats to you BadtotheTrambone  happy 2017 Congrats  Here we go for another one   Thank you  I mean today would have been no better if I wasn't sober  The hangover was happening either way haha  Hopefully it's my last though   What it doesn't do is make spending time with anyone who knows or cares about you easy or even tolerable for them  Strangers just see the "hey  he's a party guy" side and don't care any deeper  The people who know you get to watch you not give a shit about them or yourself again as you hide behind the alcohol buzz   Having said all that I do know that from your perspective  it ain't easy to face up to any of this shit when you're caught in a spiral of drinking  Ultimately you'll need to make the decision if this is how you want to live your life or if you want to change and escape the drinking  You don t need any help to drink but you will need some when you decide to give it up  even if it is just to fill in the boredom with other options  Good luck either way    Duck I'm right here   It's 3am and I just finished my liter of vodka   Woke up wasted yesterday morning at a friend's house   I was naked from the waist down in a random bedroom   Found my jeans which were soaked and I don't remember why   Vaguely remember falling down in the snow   I think   I've got the nastiest cut on my ass   Apparently we were at someone's house and there was a glass shelf that broke   The only reason I know this is from messaging  with a guy that I was with last night   He's trying to piece the night together as well but he was BO too   I'm pretty certain we had sex as I'm sore but neither one of us remember   All I could do was congratulate him for getting it up while BO   He found that hard to believe but cheers to getting awesome last night   Only plus side was I danced my ass off and stayed local so I had nonjudgmental friends around me that could make sure I was safe   And when getting home I found the liter of vodka that I stashed from the previous night so I could just stay drunk all day   Love just laying in bed and cuddling with a bottle of vodka all day   Now if I could just remember the sex     Oh well   Chairs ducker  There is actually a huge difference between pickled cabbage and Sauerkraut  Well actually there isn't  Sauerkraut is just pickled in a different way   Are you from one of those German states like Wisconsin  Cause if so  I could go on a rant right now  Hi once lost  Congratulations on 5 months  So proud and happy for you      Most depressing bullet point sheet read ever      Now that you've hit the ultimate low point of your life  maybe you can look forward to the rest of your life and think   it can only be BETTER from now on   It's a long walk  but you can get there  you're not exactly alone in that walk   so    let's make 2017 awesome  The year that made ALL the difference   I'm not drinking with you today  Ok  Tea perhaps  but non alcoholic          Where the fuck are the regulars   Are you really wondering where the regulars of an alcoholism subreddit could have possibly gone  Congrats  Art is much better sober  Well they both sound delish   And yes I'm from Minnesota   Land of 10 000 lakes and completely populated by Germans  Scandinavians and Indians  and on your year too KP  well me and my dad have been talking about this  and I've also got a friend who is really supportive  And it's just that finding a therapist seems a bit rough to me   I'd just want like a friend or someone here to talk to who can understand my situation  While I know that a therapist may know how to do their job it's just that it doesn't feel right to me  thanks for your reply  it means a lot  Haha I love your name  I've been drinking it for years now  but I imagine I might start drinking even more of it now   Well  consider your life is getting a new clean slate  pretty much like your wallet  and most peoples wallets this time of the year     Time to earn new powers  feeling just better every day  We'll have a few setbacks like the flu or the common cold biting us once in a while  but the power to stick with it and let nature do it's thing is within us  and we will come out winners later on    I am glad you took the plunge for a better life too   Welcome to a sober 2017  Thank you  Thank you    D Thanks Frank  Hmmm   interesting   Well I'm now craving sauerkraut at 3 am   Not sure how I can fix this as I'm mid bender   Trying to figure out how to sneak out of bed and get me a sandwich or something while I wait for the Xanax to kick in  I'm sorry if you feel I was preaching  I really didn't mean to come across that way  I love you too   I have no clue who you are  but you sound like a good person in need of a second chance   Everyone deserves a second chance  heck even a 3rd   4th    as long as there is the drive to want better   Wish you the best  and an awesome 2017   Thank you Lee   I realised yesterday why the year is an important milestone  It now means when I get asked 'How long ' I can reply with 'over a year' which I think signifies being in it for the long haul  Only time will tell if this is true     but just for today I will not drink with you  Well the 12 steps were apparently inspired by Bill Wilson's Ouija board sessions with a dead 15th century monk so it's subjective whether they are the be all and end all of recovery principles  I hear ya     my brain has been screwing with me this morning during my daily coffee ritual  Had someone sitting at the next table who was smoking    and the smell was intoxicating   I will be tagging you and following you  Thanks man  I think it's growing more and more clear that I need to go to rehab  I plan to next week  Detox at least  It would be nice to know what kind of wds I can expect but I guess the facility can answer that question  Try tapering with vodka   Always exciting and guaranteed to fail  Hi there  this is a good place to be for those who are dealing with recovery or addiction  I lurked for many moons before I made the decision to get serious about it  Good luck with your struggles  I agree   I have been screened and they didn't find anything    You are right  need to quit now   Good job and thank u for sharing  I'm new here and your post rly motivates me     Go to a meeting and find a sponsor there  Either died  sobered up or just too drunk to post   I took a break from here for 3 months and I was a combination of the last two   In no condition to post shit   or shitpost  I wish you the best life   You will have a beautiful life  because it's the only one you've got and you're doing really well for yourself     I'd feel like this would only tease me and possibly trigger a craving or something   I never tried Kratom  But if what you're telling me is true that it makes you feel that good  im Probably ok without it   Been free of drugs since April   No reason to fuck around  Congrats it seems like you made a lot of progress in the last year   Would you mind explaining your thoughts and feelings at 90 days and the urges you still felt  Please take care  Pancreatitis is no joke  It is one of the worst pain that one can feel   I think you know this by now    Stay sober and maintain your diet  You'll be good  thank you  Not the OP but I'm in a similar place so I'll answer   I go to just about any meeting I can  big book study included  Do I agree with everything the big book says  Of course not   But  like the guy you're responding too  it's powerful to be with a group of people who understand our mutual struggle    What I do not like and appreciate is the blame we sometimes take from religious zealots if we don't necessary assimilate whatever they say   Could you elaborate on this   I'm not sure what it means with respect to this conversation  signe me up plz Yep  sign me up    Starting out with no League and selling my gaming PC so I cannot go back   I will aim for 90 days and review from there  gotta get through January first     I am making the change as from the age of 19 23 while I have made some progress in other areas of my life it is not as much as I would like  It's time to focus on these areas  sign me plz I'm pretty sure I remember falling into a cactus last night   Might of been on the glass table that I also vaguely remember falling on and breaking   Now if I could just remember the sex that I'm positive I had   Fuck it   Chairs fuckers  Plants   We like them   Also forklifts I think that there are many paths to this place  I can relate to what you wrote  I often drank out of boredom  while watching movies or playing games  I just got tired of everything  the hangovers  not being able to perform at satisfactory levels  the monotony  at the end drinking just wasn't fun any more  And if I'm being honest to myself  it hadn't been for years  Huge accomplishment  Congrats on over 2 years   I coped by just realizing I cant control others  I realized pretty much all of my anger in life is caused by trying to control things that I have no control over   it's frustrating  I could explain this and that over and over to someone  but I am not inside someone's head  I realized it's better to not cling onto problems so hard  I let them go  and just was myself amid whatever was going on    As I'm sure you know  quitting is hard  You need to keep busy with other things that excite you and engage you  If you don't find a hobby or activity that keeps you sane  you'll go back  Also  it sounds like you may be dealing with some depression  I emplore you to talk to a doctor about it   You're already making the first step to recovery by making this post  There is no shame in reaching out for additional help  Don't white knuckle this  talk to a doctor about your lack of motivation  lack of energy  decrease pleasure in life   Good luck  Stay focused  stay strong Welcome   January 2nd is a great day to stop     "I hit rock bottom when I stopped digging "  I love this quote  Though my drinking could have gotten much worse  I put down the shovel and took the ladder that was offered to me   I will not drink today with you all   How do I actually remember what that's referring to  Nothing like crashing a forklift during your job interview   One beer  And you didn't have another  That my friend is success  I would of ended up having ten if I let myself have one   and sunny Manchester England  is colder than rainy so cal  I went to la jolla a few years back it's really nice Guess what   I will not drink today   D I'm not drinking with you fine folks today    I will not drink today  I will not drink today  For the next couple of weeks   r cripplingalcoholism is participating in our yearly population survey   Please take a few

without it is a victory  savour that and don't get too overwhelmed with the lifestyle change  best of luck   Respectfully  I would suggest that being overly cynical of every avenue that offers help  regardless of whether or not one thinks it works for them personally based on a limited trial  can be unhelpful in making progress  By not being honest with ourselves about our responsibility for our problems  and not being honest with ourselves about whether we're ready to change  we're shooting ourselves in the foot when it comes to fixing said problems   I can certainly understand your attitude about counseling  bc I had that same attitude when I first tried it  But my way of dealing with my problems  scorning others' suggestions of help  insisting that I had to have everything on my own terms with immediate results  and continuing to make excuses for why I drank  kept me in my same shitty situation  My situation didn't change  bc I didn't change my situation   It wasn't until I accepted that I was the only one responsible for my drinking  who could choose to stop drinking  and who could make sure I actually followed through  that I decided to try counseling again with an open mind  Open  that is  to criticism about my attitude and way of thinking about things  Open to suggestions  Open to trying something different than I had before  And this experience was also much better  bc I felt the counselor and I "clicked" better  communication wise  She was able to be objective  not bc I paid her  but bc she didn't come into the session with preconceived notions about me  and she really listened  If that was lacking in your first 3 counseling experiences  then no wonder you sound cynical   Lastly  if you feel that AA is too "preachy" for you  and criticize the program and those who find that it helps them  then out of curiosity  why are you insisting on going the AA route  There are other programs to try that are for agnostics or even atheists    Whatever route you choose  I hope you'll find the tools you're looking for to help you move forward  Ah  memories   It's too bad reality never lives up to those rose colored glasses   Instead it's an all too short almost bliss followed by shame  by feeling dirty  the high is never quite as good as I remembered   Or I go for broke and either wake up in my own puke  if I'm lucky  or in the back of an ambulance  or not at all   Maybe then I realize the futility and get to go through the same old bullshit over again  withdrawals  new sobriety date  PAWS   Or I don't and the path just keeps getting darker  the spiral steeper  suddenly I remember all the reasons I quit in the first place   The personal hell that is using  the way no one can trust me  the way I burn through family and friends  lighting up bridges all along the way   Spending my life waiting for a call  waiting in a parking lot  waiting to scrounge up some money some shameful way   Chasing a high  then chasing normal  then chasing to just not want to die   Waking up in the morning wishing it had been the last time I went to sleep   Sometimes I can almost convince myself there was contentment back then   almost   I'm not saying that was or would be your experience  I just know what mine was and what it would be if I forgot what my life was really like back when I was using   In my dreams it was all fuzzy warm happiness  but in reality it was hell  Sometimes I forget what hell felt like  writing it out helps me remember   Stay sober  keep that clean time   There is no such thing as just once   You can do this   Good luck  Not drinking with you today pintaschild  Welcome  I stopped on 2nd January last year by initially committing to a Dry January   I saw enough improvement to keep on the wagon  I take things one day at a time   I will not drink with you today  I'm not drinking today  Instead I shall be getting myself prepared for my first day at my new job tomorrow  Nervous   I'm in  not drinking with you today SD Messed up dreams are really common when you come off the green  and I don't know how common the dream within a dream stuff is but I've experienced that too  Best advice I can give is to not dwell on them  that stuff didn't happen  think of it as a good thing   it shows your brain is rewiring back to sobreity  And as your memory improves actual life events will take up the space instead of these fictions    I know the dwelling thing is easier said than done  but just think of this community and know we're all going through something similar and here to talk at anytime   Best of luck and happy new year   In my experience it can go either way   When I quit  my two best friends were both heavy drinkers   I no longer talk to one of them very often   she can NOT wrap her head around being sober  To her  alcohol is "fun" and anyone who isn't drinking can't be "fun"   My other friend  We meet up all the time for sober coffee and sober dinners  She still gets wasted on the weekends but she has definitely reduced her drinking and our friendship has grown much  much stronger       Plus there are all the other friends I've made through the hobbies I now have the time and energy to persue   Bonus   I don't get wasted and ruin those friendships  So sober me is coming out way ahead  I will not drink today  I will not drink today  I will not drink today  Good for you  There's no better day than today to quit gaming  You've got this  Thanks for the message of support   It will be an interesting journey     I will NOT drink today   Thank you  Keep focussing on one day at a time  You'll get here too  Sounds good mate  I never went to AA but I always keep it in mind that I could go there if I need to  This Christmas was my 3rd sober  but I had a little fuckup in 2015  The best advice I ever got was "dry people  dry places"  as in  stay out of the bars and stay away from boozy people until you feel unthreatened by the temptation to drink  I never enter a situation in which I am not 100  cast iron certain I won't drink  I prioritise sobriety above virtually everything  I also try to "play the tape forward"  meaning I am honest with myself about what happens when I drink and don't pretend that I have magically become able to handle it now I've had a few months off  One other thing is remembering "HALTT"  hungry angry lonely thirsty tired  and addressing these issues states of mind before thinking a beer is what I need  These things  and working on the core reasons why I drank in the first place  boredom  fear and frustration mostly  and changing things in my life to replace the sauce means I don't really fancy the idea of drinking now  Getting into exercise is good  as it really highlights the difference in energy levels that sobriety brings  and the free endorphins feel great  And of course hanging out on here every now and again for some support  Good to have you here mate  Like any addiction  gaming addiction holds you back in life  The only solution is quitting  You can do it  Thank you Red  I'm looking forward to you joining me in the not too distant future    Good for her  Hey man  I'm a fellow New Year's N00b  and today I'm not drinking with you    You should really think about seeing a counselor   therapist to discuss and resolve your intense feelings  if you mean "January challenge" then the answer is no  You need to check in there too  goodluck  You can't avoid them 100  but you CAN stay the hell away from 95  of them by avoiding gaming websites  forums  videos  and streams  Massive congratulations   I have 364 days to go    Holy       congratulations  calling someone a bloody idiot and my keyboard is broken so i missed a t and train of thought    1 day out of 365 was successfully completed and i am very happy and proud about it   I do not need porn and i can surely live without it    goodluck all and have a nice day      It's on brother  Today I'm going to begin service to my local AA group and start chairing a meeting   I'm then going to meet my sponsor for breakfast and work on my 6th Step   I'm doing a lot of work to keep me from a drink  so I will not drink today  Thanks for the suggestion   actually signed up for a badge a few minutes ago   I intend to stay strong and stay sober   Beautiful day here in the UK and time to walk the dogs  You've got this   What a great way to start the year  Me  too   I won't drink with you guys today     I will not drink today  I will not drink today  Yup   You're not wrong   It sure does suck   Nice thing is  though  that you never have to feel this way again   Just keep on keeping on  This   I learned that I can go a whole calendar year without alcohol   Birthdays  weddings  including my own   4th July  Thanksgiving  Christmas   I don't need to drink for any of those   So that was pretty sweet  Now I want to feast on hotdogs  Quality sausage  smart bun  little mustard and sauerkraut     No knife   no  Maybe it works for you but masturbation makes me feel weak and demotivated so I just decided to do away with it  Sign me up please  Sorry about the late sign up  Thank you  It's so freeing to be sober  A great 17 to you as well   I think what is dangerous for young people is the boys watch lorn which just uses women as objects and just for their bodies  Girls watch music videos in which the singers are highly sexualized i e  They are popular because they are sexy  put these two together you have the start of many unhealthy relationships  Boys believe women are there as sex object and girls are taught you are only important if you are desired sexually  And so to 'keep up' they do what the boys want which is porn like acts  2017 will include more playing the tape forward for me  It always ends the same  in so many ways  Doesn't it    Great job on 427  Thank you  Have a great 17 as week  Definitely  I am getting close to beating my longest streak which I set in 2014  Taking it one day at a time  has been really helpful  Congrats on your success  but don't let your guard down  Let's make this a year we will never forget  Thank you  I'm excited but nervous  New start   Happy New Year   Great job   Give both a rest for a while  think about and do other activities "That I would wake up from a blackout with consequences I could never fix"  Those words resonate so clearly with me and I am determined not to let it happen   You have clearly succeeded and I wish you and your family continued health and happiness   I will not drink with you today   Amazing  Well done  Definitely  I am stressing a theme saying which is day by day  Worry about making it through today  That is all  There is less pressure on me with this simple goal  Let's make this a great year  I'm so sorry for your losses and glad you are taking care of yourself now  That IS sweet  Great job making it through all of those days  Awesome  Checking in  First day back to work  Looking forward to the structure of  If Nothing else  Stay strong everyone   Id say your training wheels will get you there eventually if you want  CA's will reach for a drink first thing just to get out of bed  chances are youll vomit  but youll force yourself to drink more because youll feel worse if you dont  We will have to equip ouselves with enough to make it through the day  We wont drink a 1 3 or a 1 2 of anything  because if there is a bottle it is to be finished    Heaven forbid you run out the shakes will be so bad you cant drink or feed yourself  there will be vomiting  lots of it  hallucinations  seizures  you will have alcoholic polyneuropathy in your hands and feet all the time drinking or not  this is numbness pain which will gradually progress centrally toward the body from nerve damage from too much drinking  this also impairs motor function so simple tasks are hard  You also feel like you have been kicked in the kidneys liver most of the time  At least thats what its like for me   Noone here talks about shit because its a given that you are pissing out your ass most of the time  So yeah training wheels buddy  Consider it a good thing   edit for spellz It sounds like you are in a good space  I wish you continued success on your reset as 2017 gets under way  Very true  something that I'd be pushing down the line otherwise    Thanks for the support   it's truly needed   I meditate  I consider it practicing being detatched  When I actually need to use it when I am angry or on some negative runaway emotion  I try to go back to where I was in meditation  It is hard though  It is so easy to forget when negative emotions are trying to take you away from yourself  Sometimes I'll just be in some negative rut of just grinding over some issue   and it takes me hours before I remember to actually come back to reality  I am doing better  but it is no short journey  I'm not drinking today  You must take this addiction seriously  If your gf is supportive you should try calling her when you feel the urge or somebody you can trust  I find that riding out the urge helps a lot  Understand that the urge will eventually leave no matter how strong the temptation is  I actually had to ride out a strong urge this morning to watch a porn star I have watched for years  it sucked  but I made it through unscathed    Also another thing that is helping me  is to focus on making it through today  I am not worried about tomorrow  hitting a big streak  etc  I just need to survive today   That's an interesting point  and I have never really thought about it that way  I suppose alcoholism is alcoholism and you're right  this can only last so long  Can you let me know what you meant by 'I juggled a lot of things    until one day it was all too much '  When did you know you'd had enough    The problem is I definitely know I can continue this life and excel for now and drink at the same time  I guess my fear is what you've mentioned  that something is going to go wrong further down the line  It's just so hard when there isn't really an incentive to do so  Nobody disappointed in me or my actions  I've not been arrested for being naked in public or anything which might  kick start  me   I guess I just feel a little blind as to the benefits   Thank you for getting back to me  I'm sorry that the evening didn't go as planned  I hope you and your husband are able to have an open conversation about alcohol    I will not drink with you today   There's an option called Refuge here in Canada and also available in the US Hey just checking in with you to see how you are travelling   We are ihere to support and motivate ourselves and you to get sober   There is lots of good advice based on personal experience and lots of people showing   love  support  friendship  kindness to Internet strangers because we have all been there done that in the process of trying to get sober and then stay sober   You can do this  you are not alone  nor are you so unique and different from us that you won't be able to get sober  My advice read this sub daily and often during he day  the lessons  support  ideas  experiences are pure gold for a drinker  Please stay in touch  keep us up to date with your journey    You sound Aussie to me am I right   day 1 2 and 3 are hard  but it does get easier  just push through  don't give up  if you can help it  Getting sober is the best thing I ever did for me  I hope you can do it too        Good job man  Keep growing and developing yourself  Maybe you could provide some details about your experience  Riding out the urge is tough  but we must remember the urge doesn't last for long  A lot of us are good at procrastination  so we can use that skill for good by delaying ourselves from watching  which leads to the urge leaving  I will not drink today  The month of January is going to be one of change for us at work but we don't know how  what or who will be affected  I will not let fear of the unknown take over   Yeah  I don't know why people get so defensive about this and start downvoting and talking shit  It just sucks falling for a whore  no false moralism  It sucks when the woman you like start sleeping around  People don't get that  It does    But it will eventually get better    we've got this    I swear I don't want to do this again  repeat day 1   I won't drink with u Dude you just saved me from playing  Thanks a ton and let's beat this together   That's unbelievably helpful  You have no idea  really   I think it's a spot on representation of how I've been feeling the past 8 years or so  I started drinking heavily when my first relationship ended  After that I got over it  but I never felt the same again  I put it down to having depression and depression only  which was something I knew I had control of but there was always a part of that had control over me   I've been steadily less and less happy over the time since  and now I'm at the point where everything is just a milestone to pass in order to get to the next part where I might feel  not so depressed   For example  Christmas is over and I'm now just counting the days until I go to Thailand in February  There's no inherent excitement I used to feel in actually going  just wanting to get there so I can actually feel something   Do you think alcohol could be the reason for this numbed sense of life I'm feeling now   Really  thank you for your comment  Everyone in here is being so kind and it's helping greatly  Thank you for sharing your story  I can only relate to how you feel  not your circumstances  I  26F  have been smoking for the past 4 years and I'm only just realising what it's doing to me   my college work is falling behind and I lack the motivation to even get up in the morning  I plan to quit  today  Telling my parents about this is not even an option I'm going to consider  so I will do it alone  Please stay strong because there are people here who genuinely want you to get better  even though we don't know you  we just know how it feels  Good luck  my friend  Boy do I know what you mean  spoke to a dear friend last night on the phone  I could understand maybe 70  of what she said  It was late afternoon early evening  boy did that bring back memories  Don't miss those experiences    Victory   I like to think that a life full of small and pleasant things   dewy skin  a warm hug  comfy shoes   adds up to a long   lived  life no matter the number of calendar days    Gratitude is my new attitude for 2017  Congrats on 35 days  I will not drink with you today   I'm a self employed designer  The increase in productivity is a very great perk  Good work  Congrats  that is quite the accomplishment  Aww you look so nice  You definitely have a pleasant face  Made me smile right back at you  When I was drinking I would always wake up at 3am  Always  I would stagger to the bathroom  chug some water then stumble back to bed  I sleep like a rock now  Love it  I didn't have heartburn but my stomach was upset or bloated every day  It's gone now  Imagine that   Congrats on a year    Thank you for sharing that with me  I really appreciate it  I feel like I'm think I'm you around where your fourth sentence ended  Reading these comments is making me realise that I might not be the special  superherohighfunctioning  alcoholic I thought I was  It's all going to go tits up if I don't do anything about this soon   Quick question  do you still hang around with people who drink  I live in a big house of 7 people you see  Everyone is quite big drinkers in the house  They're so wonderful and the last thing I want to do is move out  but do you have any advice for managing that  I think keeping a journal is a great idea  Fuck you alcohol I'm saying NO WAY and going to AA today   Thank you  I'm definitely going to give it a read  There's been so much support  Thank you  I am one day behind you   Stay strong  Today is my first day too   And I have just started practicing ukulele  I will not drink today   Thanks SD  You have inspired me to write my relapse story  Ten days after you were admitted to the hospital  I hit a very low rock bottom  It went real bad for me  I have 100 days today and I am also just happy to BE  Good job on one year  I love seeing all of the changes you experienced in one year  All by choosing to not drink  Yes  Thank you for sharing  All my friends that have given up on that shit are super better now  Many had entirely new lives in about two years  It's pretty amazing  but the process sucks and withdrawals are hard and really really suck   After you're not sick than you feel like a new person  Staying stopped takes work  but its growth like anything else   I'd say go back to  r stopdrinking  lurk  hangout  comment  etc  it's a positive place which is needed early on   Don't be discouraged by the mods  Ever since that stupid news article and the inflation of the subs membership  as well as the egos of a few mods  it's been a little weird  but it's still a really good place  Use it to meet sober people  which is what it's for   Good luck  work your program  check your pride  and be a better person for you  and no one else    Not drinking with you all today    You didn't know it  but I didn't drink with you last night  I'm not drinking tonight with you either  Have a great day  Thanks for your post  I can definitely feel one 'yet' coming along with my work  As I mentioned  we can work anywhere we want  At the moment my working hours are Mon Thu 9am 6pm and Fri 9am 12pm  I find myself working from home at every opportunity because I am often too tired to get out of bed  Fridays I often log in when I wake up and then go back to sleep  Luckily at the moment I have control over my workload so it's not too much of a big deal  and my KPI's are always spot on  but it does feel strikingly like what you've said  How long until my performance drops  you know   Thanks again for your comment  really appreciate it and I hope all goes well with you  Personally right now I allow myself to fap when the urge arises  Which is not as much as I thought it would be  I am more focused on quitting porn than not fapping right now  I want to focus my willpower on this for now so as I strengthen it without porn  I can eventually have more willpower to use it on abstaining from fapping  The changes to your appearance will only improve  skin tone  collagen rebuilding  firmness   hydration  less puffy face and eyes  etc  Over time I also noticed improvements to my hair  Initially I stopped drinking due to vanity  I was sick of waking up and being horrified when I saw the hungover troll peering back at me through the mirror  I thought I was just aging poorly but after 1 month sober I realized it was all the booze draining my beauty    Congrats on stopping and expect to hear more compliments    I don't think I'll ever get over the feeling of caring about someone so much and wanting something so badly for them  knowing they don't care about them self or want it for them self  And I don't think there will ever come a time that I don't have some level of optimism  This is exactly how I feel about my father drinking  I used to think I hate him since I was a kid but after reading this  I think I hate his drinking more  I hope you find you some relief and thanks for posting   I'm not drinking today  Yesterday I thought to myself "2017 will be my first sober year " That might be so  but I don't want to forget that we are all working on staying sober TODAY   I will not drink today  I refuse to be complacent  Strength in numbers   Great job on one year    Don't hate it  see it for what it is as a path to better yourself  What is more appealing  the uninformed person who watches porn occasionally while living a mediocre life not fully knowing how it limits them  Or the knowlegable person who quits altogether and becomes the best version of himself  If you didn't fully know how porn affects you in a negative way then you could never fully know what you would become without it  Make sense  I am guessing this is the kind of stuff that they teach in alchemy    Life is duller but you don't have the lows  I think I needed to hear someone say this  I think generally accepting that things are going to change is a big personal thing for me  It's nice to hear for the first time that people are actually enjoying life despite the fact that things are a bit greyer  edit  maybe the colour and happiness I feel from alcohol is only fake happiness  god I don't know  this is all so confusing    Hopefully if I give up  the colour is going to come from elsewhere    Thanks a million  Thank you for sharing your story  I hope you get better  Xxx Quit before it gets worse  The amount of dopamine we get from porn can be just as harmful to our brains as drugs  It may seem harmless now  but overtime it will get worse and be even harder to quit  I am 22 now and have been trying to quit for the last 3 years  it's not easy  You should be happy you found this community at such a young age  Will not drink today   Have the week off and going to get into a good groove with exercise and meal prep    Good luck I see great things for you this year   On this train with you today   We got this   What a triumph  Thank you for writing this up   this day you've helped and inspired more people than you'll ever know  I won't drink with you today  That's exactly how I felt this Christmas  I always felt like I was about 1cm out of the room  I was there  answering questions  making up funny quizzes and telling jokes  but I wasn't quite with it   I just want the best for myself and my family  I don't think I'm the best I can be right now   Thanks for your comment  Really appreciate it like I do all of your comments  You're taking the time pro bono to help me and that's something I haven't had in such abundance before  I'm 5 days smoke free and feeling really proud  doesn't sound much but to me it's amazing   I wanted to stop for a while and said I would in the new year however I got flu and bad chest infection so gave me the incentive to stop sooner  Good luck on your smoke free journey      Hey I'm checking in to every check in I see  I'm on board   Welcome  As university teacher  I can honestly say that not drinking makes my job much easier and  not so coincidentally  the students much more enjoyable to spend time with    For me  the first three days were miserable and I spent most of that time flitting from one distraction to another just to make it sober to day four  After that  I gave myself permission to just work on creating new  sober  routines for the first month  which also meant eating entirely too much sugar  ice cream and jellybeans   By the end of 30 days  my alcohol cravings were a dull  infrequent roar and so were my sugar cravings  Not being too hard on myself for poor food choices and reading hear daily were the main things that got me through the early days    Oh  Sleep   my favorite gift of sobriety   was actually restful after the first week  That  in and of itself  was awesome    I will not drink with you today   I'm wondering    If you can stay sober for six months without AA  why do you think you need it now  I'm so proud of you for one year plus    GREAT job   Last year I felt like I wouldn't message u ninjilla for a one year coin  This year  if I hit that mark  I will   What an amazing act of recognition  All through the internet  This place amazes me day in and day out in such a positive way     I am going to work and not drinking with you today   Day 7   Congrats  I can certainly relate to your description of the dawning knowledge that moderation is a no go  Glad you're here  and I won't drink with you today  Thank you  You know something  Me too    For you too   Welcome and best wishes  So proud of you   What an awesome  healthy accomplishment  Thank you for this post  and a special thanks to all that the mods do on here to keep this sub going     Hi bobaduk   We are sharing some pretty common ground    I only drink in the evenings but it is never "just the one drink"   I have looked in the mirror  don't like what I see and am being honest with myself for the first time in years   I also want to make 31 12 17 a sober NYE   I wish you success and am happy to share the journey with you  That's great     I had a simikar thing the other day where i opened the camera on my phone and it was on selfie mode so my face was right there in the screen  Normally i have a mad panic trying to switch the mode back as quick as i can so as not to look at my face  But this time i actually thought wow i look pretty good and healthy   Which is a big change     Trusting myself to do what I committed to  and actually delivering on that promise was hugely significant  more than anyone else might realise   If I can't trust me  who can I trust  Rely on  Lean on    I needed to be able to be the person I could count on and every time I was not  a little bit of life and light faded   I was sooo glad when I stated to deliver on my promises to myself  and it still is a great source of contentment for me  Thanks scrawn11  Reading it today  The few days after the drunken event  I always have this huge motivation to stay sober  The Q is    Any advice on maintaining this motivation  Great motivation in this forum of course and maybe staying in touch here could help  Special drink coins  for sure  You earned those special coins  Great job  The "superpower" thing is basically our brains coming back down to normal levels of dopamine  that we can get a high from regular things  We are so numb that basic human traits seem like superpowers because we haven't really felt them before   I read everything and it was very insightful  But I can't lie the keyboard thing caught my attention because I am a mechanical keyboard nerd  Love me some Cherry MX Blues   I got the pleasure of being the DD for my boyfriend and a dear mutual friend on NYE  It was such a privilege  They're not heavy drinkers but they had a few and I sipped free ginger ale all night and danced my tuckus off  It was awesome and fun and I remember all of it     I hope my nieces and nephews call me for a ride if they need it no matter what too  way to go being an exceptional Aunt   Not drinking today   Holidays have gotten a bit too long for my young kids   they are climbing the walls and stuff and that has always been one of my main excuses to pour a stiff bourbon   Last night was pretty bad   I was exhausted and kids were too   and fighting since that's what tired kids do   I did NOT pour a stiff drink or any other kind of booze   I did end up making yet another green tea at 10PM   So   here I am   day 70 and still going   I will not drink today  SD   I'm in   Congrats   And wishing you the same  Take everything one day at a time  Live in the moment  Let's all make it to the end this year  I think this is the thing I shouldn't say  but I feel alcohol did enhance my life for a long time  As I said I live in London  and I got caught up on this absolutely magical  magnificent  hedonistic scene of people  Take a look at  these images  https   www google co uk search q sink the pink london safe off espv 2 biw 1312 bih 744 source lnms tbm isch sa X ved 0ahUKEwjMgOvzs6PRAhXjBcAKHYOKCbQQ AUIBigB   It's this insane  colourful world where alcohol and drugs are taken and in honesty  it did enhance the experience  It made me feel alive  Now that scene is kind of gone  I've grown out of it and am more in favour of dinner parties and hanging with friends  so alcohol doesn't serve the purpose of fun filled frivolity it did anymore   I think I'm hanging onto my younger days when booze was this amazing thing that made you feel confident and cool  and now it's just something I'm using to get through a night out   Can you let me know how it felt when you describe 'true enjoyment  peace  rest and meaningful interactions'  That's probably not the easiest feat  but I genuinely am struggling to see how I will ever be able to experience them  How long did it take you off the drink to start having these  Was there a period between giving up and starting to experience these things   I haven't heard of 30 60 90 days without alcohol  But that sounds like a great idea  I'm going to try my first 30 days without booze this January  So far I've not had anything and I feel quite committed to it    Thanks so much for your advice    Way to go   Five months is an eternity  I am so happy for you  72h is the peak of cravings  Hang on  on day at a time  Also check whyquit com or Joel Spitzer on YouTube for a lot of information on what happens during the quit  daily videos   Oh my  yes  The voice saying  "Well  there you go again having another drink   " laughed at me daily  I am beginning 2017 so much happier with me   Now if I were you I would make a bullet list of all the things you can look forward to once you are free from the clutches of alcohol  I have my list of things I am starting to realize are possible   I am glad to be here with all of you today  because all of us are on day 1 together   I will not drink today  I got sober at 39 also  It gave me a new life too I will not drink today   Ahh  the peak  That makes a lot of sense  I'll check the videos out  thanks  Not drinking today  NYE "a sip of champagne at midnight won't hurt" was the hard part  Today   easy peasy  Good luck  I am quitting cigarettes  PMO and weed so i kinda know what you're going through  Good luck  We got this  I wasn't confident when I started either  but what made it a bit easier was realizing all I had to do was make it through today sober   Rinse  repeat  and 365 one day stints later we will have a year   You can do this   I will not drink with you today   I relate well to your post  I'm almost 6 months along and I still reflect on my past drinking  It feels really good to write it out though doesn't it  For me  when I write out my feelings  it makes it more real and makes me deal and confront those feelings  I will say for me  not drinking has absolutely changed my life 1000  for the better  Keep it up  I will stay sober with you today   i honestly cant recommend it  most of the "benefits" of nofap pfree were thought up by people who are porn addicts  or at least had a nasty habit with the stuff  from what you posted  i would not say you belong in either of those groups  as for falling asleep  nofap will actually hurt you with that    also  dont take the advice of this community too seriously  what youre doing is equivalent to crashing an AA meeting and asking if it would be a "good idea" for you to quit booze  of course you will get a bunch of lectures about the dangers of alcoholism  how everyone wishes they had never touched that first drink etc  no honorable mention of all those folks who drink occasionally and have a great time doing it    now  im not saying its NOT a good idea for you to quit porn  just that the reasons in your post do feel like its necessary   I think it's the health reasons mainly  Sometimes I get this weird feeling near my liver  It's not pain but it's just an uncomfortable feeling especially when lying down  I think this is almost certainly something to do with alcohol  Doc said not to worry about it but I have a sneaky feeling that's what it is   Aside from that  it's the absolute knowledge that I am the person in my life that drinks more than anyone else  I know it  I have another friend who has alcoholism but I know she drinks less than me  I suppose it's the shame of that knowledge that I'm  the worst  that is making me want to quit     Honest question  Was drinking one of the ways you managed that   Absolutely  for a time  Booze numbed my depression and stopped me from thinking about it  Then I discovered CBT and managing my thoughts effectively  and I gained some control over it  but now you mention it  I think when I'm most depressed is when I drink the most  so I'm almost certainly using it as a coping mechanism in some senses still   Thanks for sharing your comments about your own personal journey  Lots of people have mentioned losing a part of yourself  the part that alcohol gives you   however you and others also mentioned that new and other exciting things come about which you like more in your life  I don't think I ever got as far as thinking of the good things that would come along  and instead only thought about removing the bad things and coming back onto a neutral level  This gives me hope   Thank you very much   I'm all in  I feel inspired today  i won't drink today  It will be hard  Sometimes it might even seem impossible  But your life will improve beyond your wildest dreams  I promise you    Way to go reaching out for help  That's one of the hardest things any of us do  Somewhere along the way  we learn to keep doing it and  sooner than we think  we're the ones reaching out to help the next miserable alcoholic  I was one  I drank a gallon of whisky a day  every day  for two years  after spending the 10 years prior to that ratcheting up to that point  I was dying and I walked into AA  I found this sub when I started reading Reddit  I'm really grateful for SD as well as my twelve step community    We love you  We're here for you  You are never alone in this  Osprey   404  GREAT job and good to see you  I hope you had a great holiday with your family  I will not drink today     http   sd bot nu badgedate  For me personally  the first few weeks are relatively "easy"  I don't get physical withdrawals and the hangovers are fresh in my mind    As time goes on  for me  it's the one month mark  my addicted brain kicks in    "Come on girl  you've done a month  A TRUE alcoholic is pouring vodka on their cornflakes   Just have a couple  On a weekend  Like a normal person  You're all good now "  Then I'm back onto my daily drinking routine faster than you can pop a cork    It's kind of like when you see all the gyms full in January  dead in February  Everyone starts with good intentions  to keep going takes dedication  One day at a time    This time I recognise this is where I need to do the hardest work    I've started a blog to keep myself accountable  and also to become ridiculously famous and make millions haha   I've looked into online courses that will help me in my career so that when I get home from work I'll have something constructive to do rather than just sit  slowly drinking myself to bad health and unhappiness  I'm reading so many books  I'm chatting here with like minded people  I'm going to AA     I saw a quote recently that said "falling down is an accident  staying down is a choice"  I'm choosing to NOT stay down    Good luck to you  we've got your back    I will not drink with you today   Great to read such a story  That's what life is about   Great to read such a story  That's what life is about   Okay so far  Woot  Congrats on getting the first two weeks under your belt  those are doozies   I will not drink with you today  I could be looking into a mirror to my future with you  I think it's about time I did something about this  Just started crying  God I didn't realise when I posted this that I'd actually begin to realise what I'm doing to myself   Thank you  really  It's my pleasure   keep us posted  What wonderful progress over the past year   Great job  I'm excited to see what other small changes you add in 2017  Your slow n steady wins the race approach is working  That's great     Quitting before desparation is quite extraordinary   This hit me hard  Thank you  For me  it was such a strange feeling combining hurting for her and celebrating for myself  Was it similar for you   I definitely do feel lucky to have realised this  I hope I can get there before it gets worse  Thank you  Happy to not drink today  Coming up 100 days soon    not drinking mannnnngggg I am totally with you  So sick of this    I'm in things i can't do    drink  list of things i could do    everything        i don't know what i enjoy most going to bed sober  waking up sober  or being clear headed throughout the day so i can actually be productive    Why not all three    It's a sales site  So because he had a really good experience with Kratom and is recommending a reputable source for a legal substance  this is spam   What if I post a link to my favorite brand of immodium lope   Kratom has done great things for me as well  Any substance that taps your opiod receptors is a slippery slope  of course   But to tell you the truth  I've never really gotten high off kratom  It covered about 50  of my WDs from Subs and gave me room to get out of that posionous drug  But not once did I really 'enjoy' taking it  It helped me sleep and helped me function at work and most importantly  helped me get my mind right    You can't expect a sick mind to make right recovery decisions  That is the beauty of having a bridge like kratom or even subs  Just my opinion  My family is on holidays and I will not drink today  Take care  Your post has been automatically removed because you used a keyword which is reserved for the

questions or concerns   Checking in with an inquisitive eye toward the future     Alcoholism for me was a disease of selfishness   This is absolutely right  Although I don't hurt anyone at the moment  it's definitely something that I do with an entire disregard for the possibility of hurting someone else or myself  I'm just lucky I haven't  edit  yet   I think my biggest reasons to quit are my health  but also I would like to do it for the financial side of my life  I know alcohol slowly munches away at my salary every month  and I feel so ashamed that it does    I have about 1400 a month after everything goes out for myself  and yet at the end of every month I end up with 2 50 left  my credit card maxed out and I'm literally hitting F5 on my internet banking screen at 11 59pm before payday so I can pay everything off and get back into the black  I then find myself in the position where my wage has just paid off my debts  so I turn to drink because I get so down about never being able to save  I can definitely pocket 500  a month if I gave up alcohol  Maybe this can be my incentive   Thank you for your comment  you've all been so helpful  What a brilliant community  Where is the Kratom from  If it's from a reputable website  start with 3 4g  If it's from a headshop  you may need 5 8g    For me  less was more  I stabilized on 2 5g 3x a day before tapering off Kratom   The key here is not to try to get 'high' off of the kratom  but to feel normal or almost normal   Pm me for good sources online  Some even do same day or 1 day shipping  at a price    It is MUCH better than going back to pills  Especially with all those death pills going around  I think thats totally true  I'm very lucky in that most  if not all of my friends would still hang out with me if I chose a non drinking path  My mum also has an alcohol issue  and I think it would benefit her too if I didn't drink in her presence  I will not drink with all of you today SD  x I'm so happy for you  Congrats on one year  I'm sitting here thinking about what January 1 has brought  There are so many of you who sometime around the new year decided it was time to make some changes  To have been here witnessing most of that journey with you is heartwarming  Then  there are so many Day 1's  Wow  I'm overjoyed to see that many people ready to make a change   My goal for 2017 is to embrace being sober with the same idea as you have  One day at a time  Don't get too far ahead of myself  It can be done but patience and diligence is needed  So  here goes  I will not drink today with you    Have a great day  I will not drink today  I really love this  Let's use our joy in our newfound sobriety to help others in whatever ways we can   This entire post has been brigaded heavily by r kratom  As each day goes by  you are one step closer to removing one of those things on your list  Your anxiety will lessen  puffiness will go away   and so on  You're here  and that's what's important  I will not drink with you today  It's best to let these things pass without thinking of them  Treat them as what they are   a joke  It would be a joke to go back after fighting for 3 months   Meditation helps a lot 1 2   three four  I ain't going to drink no more   Still not drink daily with you folks  Enjoying the new year   sober   For the next couple of weeks   r cripplingalcoholism is

ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles PMC4369544     Just the abstract doesn't tell you much  you may want to read the whole article  After the 90 days I was very keen on attempting to moderate it  actually I was too keen on it  I just felt that I am not even remotely over it   I had the strongest urges at around 150 days actually  80  of the time I was thinking about gaming  but that went away after one week and since then the urge is completely gone  Like death struggle  Oh nooos  look guys   it magically fucking dissolved  http   i imgur com YOEfGRT jpg     Apparently we don't have two fake fucks who are lying twats     My bad    Just kidding  I filled that with water     They're frauds  Woohoo  Great job   If you know it to be true  that is all that matters  Your Your beliefs and true self are shown in your actions and your loved ones will fall in line with your actions   The most you can do is to tell your GF  'LOOK  I am clean right now and damn proud  I am going to live my life clean  You can either believe me or not '  Don't stress too much  I will not drink today   Yes  The small wins are always the most meaningful for me  One of my favorites is that when I can't find the right word for a sentence I no longer panic and worry that it's because of alcohol delated damage  It's just simple stupidity   Who would have ever thought I would celebrate my intellectual weaknesses      I am not drinking today      I will not drink today  I kinda did the same thing but in a different way really  I simply just unfollowed anyone who posted triggering pictures to me on instagram  I follow lots of people on instagram who post nothing provocative at all and I really didn't wanna miss out on those so I unfollowed the dirty ones and feed is now as clean as it gets     The answer to that question is  you're not ready to quit  Maybe it was me that miss read your comment then  Gratz on your journey and great 2017  I find that often times the path of some resistance yields far better results than the path of least resistance  Giving in to drink is easy  Being a warrior and fighting the good fight has some resistance  but you come out on the other side a better person for it   just like you are making this post  Hell yeah  I will not drink today  I've been making it through visits that used to REALLY tempt me to drink   but this time was different  I don't miss drinking at all  I didn't think that was possible  Bring on 2017  Holy fuck you drink so much you must have space aids like this is FOR REAL SERIOUS CRIPPLING DRINKING how are you alive   DID YOU ACTUALLY SAY WE DONT TALK ABOUT POST DRINKING SHITS YOU FUCKING IDIOT   YOU ARE A POST DRINKING SHIT FUCK OFF It's such a huge thing and I have so many feeling and thoughts that it's difficult to streamline it into a text  at least for me  Just one thing  The by FAR most important change is my feeling towards time   When I was gaming I was constantly thinking about how little time I have left  everyday  and that everything I do  be it school or going out  takes even more from that precious time  And if you want to get better at a game you just can't have enough time  so that I really really wanted to earn money as a pro or streamer just so that I can play more   And this leads to very short sleep  I always felt that's a waste of time   avoiding of relaxation like chilling at the beach and it leads to unhappiness because you can't really solve that problem  So when you quit gaming you realize that you have a lot time  In the beginning you will be bored to death  But soon you will find things to do  you will probably find so many things that you have to decide which one you prefer  Now I can enjoy what I'm doing without thinking about getting back home to start Steam I will not drink today  I thought I had already singed up for this but lets go  Thank you     Hopefully home time in the next few days  Well said   captures my experience here  as well  Welcome  everyone  Good luck on your new job   I will not drink today Right there with you  I'm going for 30 days sober at the moment    after drinking essentially every single night for the passed 4 months  We can do it  I  like you  seek to deepen my humanity this year   More personal understanding  leading to more positive citizenship and stewardship  leading to more personal satisfaction  leading to more personal understanding  and so on   I also do not know what forms these changes may take  and I am fighting to be open to whatever my growth may bring   Today i will NOT DRINK to awareness and growth with you  In terms of quantity  I'll drink 2 bottles of shitty brandy during a day  Something like half a bottle during the day  one bottle and a half at night  i would tend to agree  this is a more healthy way of looking at progress  you can look at it like this  there are two main methods of dealing with addiction  of any kind   the abstinence model  and the recovery model  the focus on streaks of abstinence with no "relapses" is IMO an abstinence model   im not trying to say ones better than the other  and if going for a streak works for you  then it works for you  In my case  I often can go 2 weeks without porn  and end up relapsing  This has been going on for a while now  this is better than what it used to be  viewing porn daily or multiple times a week for almost 10 years   The recovery model is about slow change and long term goals   seeing improvement over time and not overly focusing on those times you messed up   Right now Im disappointed that I cant keep a longer streak than a couple weeks  why do I always have to go back  what needs is porn filling for me  how else can i meet those needs  and how can i plan preemptively to have a back up plan when my ego becomes nothing and I feel like looking at porn because my life feels like it doesnt matter  Will Remember September   I think I'll try running 4 to 5k about 4 times a week  I smoke a lot when I drink  and running during sober periods makes me realize the damage all the drinking and smoking does to my body as I see my stamina go up real quick by a lot  This is a great motivator for me and physical evidence of all the extra energy not drinking gives me  If I keep this up  I should be able to run 8 to 10k again within a few weeks  during drinking periods I can run 3k max  totally exhausted     It also seems that stopping drinking at these times is socially acceptable and even admired no questions asked  it is seen as a strength   Where do you live         Day 2  Feeling rough  Not drinking today  Oh I thought you were gonna say go to the saunas and blow old Nazis for war memorabilia he can auction off for booze money and then when he pounds bottom shelf vodka instead of sweet jager it won't taste so bad because he's used to the foul taste of German old man jizz and because he's dehydrated from sauna sweating the booze will hit that much faster  Then reap the ultimate reward   the sweet release of death  I will not drink today  Productive day yesterday  and lots on my plate today  Bring it on  Glad to hear that  thanks a lot    There will be days when you question why you stopped gaming  when your life has improved already and you think you can start again  Especially when you lack the motivation you have to be disciplined to go on  because that's when you really begin to change  and find alternatives to gaming   IMO I will not drink today   Second that  very Trainspotting of you   Well done  I see people here agreeing with you  and I do to  I made a simular post a few days back because some random soft porn appeared on instagram randomly  Well I was scrolling trough search wich means people you dont follow appear there  I think Instagram is fun because I follow only friends and family and trust me  I was an anti socialmedia type of guy  I dont think you have to unnistall instagram just unfollow every model  I'm going back to bed    I never set out to expose frauds on reddit  just happened that way    I don't even want any of this bullshit  but they probably shouldn't be allowed to continue    Maybe you guys care  I dunno    See you in 8 hours    Do what you will  Still chugging along  SO glad I didn't cave on NYE  I will not drink today  Congrats on your decision  Day 2 for me too    And already feeling much better than I have felt in a while    non hungover mornings are so good    I will not drink with you today  That's 1 8 liters  btw Pancreatitis also spurred me to quit  Mine wasn't nearly as serious as yours  thank goodness  It was just starting due to gallbladder issues  It scared me so much that I stopped cold turkey and haven't looked back  So glad you are on the road to recovery   Thats pretty much where I am now  Tired of not feeling well  in a fog  Ive been diagnosed with depression by a few doctors and I think that makes things worse just because I don't have the mental energy most people do  that in turn makes me give up on things I should follow through on  then nothing to do  then boredom  then do the easy things and drink myself to sleep  Everyday stuff just feels daunting  even keeping a small group of friends around or finishing a degree  I just know that I don't want to waste anymore of my time in that state of mind  Thanks for the input  Alcohol is not on my side of the battle lines either  I won't drink with you today   I will not drink today    Yup  I'm in for both  Good luck buddy  Some things I do to keep myself busy  non alcoholic here    as computers are my source of income and hobby  then it's obvious  video games  tons    programming  reading about   learning new IT stuff  then comes internet  I read quite a lot about space exploration or science in general  watch documentaries  TED talks  educational youtube videos or movies on the subject  yeah  movies  I watch like 2 3 good ones a week  or some tv series  southpark    I also play guitar  not much as I want to though   sometimes do some papercraft or similar model building  also I love to cook  I hate to clean the apartment but I have to do it from time to time anyways      also I pick up a good read  being it some boring science article or any book comics   I watch read news to keep up with latest domestic world events  get out for a walk  do some exercises  yoga   or I just sit on the sofa and pick my nose       and reddit  of course     I definetly agree  But I think everyone else does too  They werent "agaisnt" you  it was just an idea the programmers and the mods didnt have  I will not drink today no matter what  So there's a difference between advice and the key to stopping  Imho the key to stopping is wanting to and having the guts to do it  Now my advice is simply get away from anything pot related  physically speaking  Train yourself to leave the area if friends or strangers are smoking even if it's only for a while  Eliminate all potential temptation  Also don't hit rock bottom like I did  It's really not necessary  especially if you already know you want to quit  I will not be drinking with you today   Good luck   Sometimes nerves are a good thing  I will not drink today  You are right  respect people who respect you     How about showing some respect and having a grateful heart for them allowing you to live there  Stop using them as an excuse for your drug problem   Your parents arent allowing you to live there  Its their responsibility to feed you  put a roof above your head  They are responsible for you at 17  Hi spiral   I was also a lying drinker   I hid my drinking for nearly four years   I finally got to the point where he isolation was too much   I also realized I was no longer in control   Welcome and I will not drink with you today     A binge eating problem    Coursework    Issues with my ex    Biggest   that I needed to deal with being transgender and actually transition Hi everyone  good morning  I'm not drinking today  Thanks for the info  so far Ive been 3 days without anything  no withdrawal effects luckily  Maybe a little grumpy but nothing serious  You're definitely right about finding new friends though  all Ive done with them for the past few years is drink and party  So I guess the solution is find new friends with similar interests outside of drinking right  The medication I cant really do without  I currently work  12 hour midnight shifts and without them I would never get any sleep  I would like to move to a job during the day but the benefits and pay at my current job are really just too important for me right now  Other than drinking though I think Im pretty healthy  I eat my fruits vegetables  have an overall healthy diet  What tea do you use to help sleep  I would like to try that too  Thanks for the input   Thank you  Just from experience  I'm guessing you're sort of low balling your use  60 90mg a day while not terrible  is still probably 4 6 months of use  Enough to tell that you'll most likely go back after running out and getting sick  So  Coming from someone who has gone through both oxy and sub addiction for 5  yrs   Buy the kratom first and make sure it's from a reputable source    Wait till your withdrawing and try 3 5g of Kratom to make sure it's enough to get rid of WDs  but not get you high   As soon as the WD fades  Flush the rest of the pills  Get your mind right  You won't need these with kratom   Take the kratom only as needed  for sleep or very bad WDs  Do NOT get in a regimen besides perhaps a dose when you wake up and before you goto sleep  Once you start rationalizing and saying  'well i can cut back from 6x a day to 3''  is when you'll think of kratom as your next drug   Do this for a week with kratom  then toss it  Get in good habits of going to the gym  eating healthy  and not abusing alcohol or drugs   If you're not taking more than 15g a day  it should be totally doable and you won't be withdrawing much   Finally  start going to some meetings or something to supplement your mind   Of course in a perfect world  I'd say go cold turkey  But this isn't a perfect world and certainly not a perfect disease  For me going to a psychiatric ward helps  I was bulimic for several years and thinking that I got this and would ween myself off it soon  but never did  I self admitted and stayed for three weeks  Costly I know but in the long run thinking about all the food that is wasted it was worth it  I hope you can find help soon before it goes on for any longer   Wow   thanks for relating this because it's hard to imagine getting to such a terrible state     and yet as we all know  it's really very easy   It's one day at a time of saying I'll stop drinking tomorrow  and then tomorrow etc   Thank you so much for your honesty and you have stopped me from drinking tonight   I am going out to get some fuel for my car and the temptation was there to go to the bottle shop while I'm out     but I won't now  I will not drink today  I will NOT drink today     I reckon that sounds about as good as it could have done when you tried drinking again  It reaffirmed the reasons you quit without a huge disaster  Sounds like you've got a good friend there  Welcome back   Not drinking with u     I am with you right now  I have finally realized that I am so very angry at my husband that not even his sobriety can fix it   His sobriety is always a lie anyway   Whether it lasts a day  a week  a month  or a year   the lie always comes back   Nothing can save my relationship now  I will not drink today  I'm in  Thank you for sharing  This was where I was heading and I'm so happy I was able to stop  Congratulations on your sobriety and new found health   It will ALWAYS be your fault   I am just learning this   It doesn't make it easier knowing that   but it will always be YOUR choices that get the blame   Never his  Ever   Stand strong   For yourself  Same to you   I was thinking about you    You beat me to it     pulls out dick  starts measuring  This subreddit has helped me so much   Reading you guy's posts make me realize that I am not alone   I am not crazy   I am not to blame   Thank you  I'm not sure because both times I stopped I was so sick for about 5 days but I think it was because I pretty much poisoned myself on my binges  And had the worst anxiety  physical but I believe due to my distant black outs so the anxiety had cause  Hmm come to think of it I wonder if it was some kind of withdrawal  Not too much help there for you  I think ten days is the time your body will have no alcohol left and t should be much better physically from there  Keep it up   What specifically  I despise all the clickbait  memes  'tagging pictures if your name is X'  political opinions and sponsored ads   Amusingly they still have conscription national service over there  It's a pile of shit  fucking bunch of rabble  but what else can you expect from a bunch of teenagers  Anyway I think all the Nazi stuff was looted  the fucking swastika is illegal there now  You can do it  Mad Props  I'm doing a drynuary and then re evaluating  need this sub to help me do it  Sign me up  Tapers  while a novel idea  usually fall face first   More importantly  withdrawals are the easy part  The harder part comes on day x  when you feel better and convince yourself that you did a good job and you deserve a pill today  Just 1 though of course   You know it and I know it   Either commit to the WDs and going clean or go on a maintenance program  You want the best of both worlds here  and it's probably not going to happen   Sorry  but have to be realistic  Thank you   I'm going to follow your example and make that promise every day 'just for today '  Congratulations on a year   It's my ex girlfriends birthday today  Hell  it's a stretch to call her an ex girlfriend really  We were just very close friends with benefits  The amount of drama I went through with her could be a novel  The pre fwb  the during  and the post   it could genuinely be a book    I sincerely believed I loved her and I still dont think I can recreate that feeling with anyone else  She was the girl Leonard Cohen would write about  We don't talk anymore  but there's no negative feelings  we said merry Christmas  She seems to be doing quite well  It's been 2 years and I think about her all the time  Today  obviously  I'm thinking about her more    There's not much I wouldn't give to spend another night with her    but I wouldn't give up my booze    Cheers  and miserable Monday to you all  This is a big one  Let's do this   sign me up  Thanks for sharing  I feel the same and decided to quit in order to start feeling alive again  to feel and understand clearer    Best of luck and cheers for clean 2017 hes american he wont understand metric unless its converted to drams and gills  Good advice and very true  I managed a bit more sleep and feel better now   I've had some odd dreams up till now  never anything like that  It was just so crazy how real it felt waking up  so sure I was actually awake this time  I guess I have a lot more of this to look forward too   Happy new year to you too    Halfway to 90 days today  Which is halfway to 180 days  Which is halfway to a year  I will drink alot of green tea and green smoothie today but no booze  Love  Checking in Yes  that is why I wanted to know other's opinions too   It is your personal issue and you have to sought it out it's self and If a person really care for you want to protect you then i personally suggest you please don't let him go  Right here with you    Good luck  I'm not drinking today  I had debated theses past  4 months about posting this story  I'm more of a lurker than a contributor  Inspiring you to avoid drinking  even if it's only for a day   that makes sharing so worthwhile    I just turned down another line  this is more than just turning down lines because I know if i would have taken it I would have spent my entire  3000 check i just got Agreed Also  this may help some people from binging  if someone relapsed  that doesn't means their progress resets too  That time still counts  This would help  as people sometimes think  now that I've relapsed  I may view it for sometimes more  but doing that will increase their relapse counter and no one would want that  Good Job  OP especially with the flight anxiety   Anime frequently becomes an addiction no better than gaming     There's not much I wouldn't give to spend another night with her    but I wouldn't give up my booze   Good  I was beginning to worry about you      I had a relationship like that once  All I can tell you is after 25 years  it doesn't hurt as bad    I remember this feeling so well  I found immense relief that this would be the last time I ever felt that feeling again  If ever I want to drink again I just remember that feeling  Oh and loosing all my stuff too  The worst  Well I didn't drink and I had a lovely evening   Umm    Drynuary  Drybruary  Drarch  Drapril  May  Drune  dry July  Draugust  Dreptember  Droctobober  Nothanksvemeber  Drycember   Hi there  Just wanted to tell you that you aren't alone  I also had a massive habit for a longtime  I  too  am was scared of my brain  Hell  no one knows us like we know ourselves and that mental piece and fear kept me a slave for a longtime  I did exactly what you are doing  tapered  I tapered 93 days in total  The first week I cut 2 3 of my dose and waited to ADJUST  Took about 5 days  That was the worst of it  after you adjust at 20g  slow down  You don't have to torture yourself  I jumped  really I would call it a step off  it was shockingly easy  at 2 5g  5doses a day   0 5g  and it REALLY was ok  No crazy crying after that first week or two  I am telling you  you will be OK  Don't let the fear trick you  You can do this  Keep chipping away at it and before you you it  it's done  The glimpse you see of your old self will start to increase and you will see the old you get a foot hold and the old Kratom brain move out  This requires discipline and the want to quit  Sounds like your ready  Let me us know if we can help  Congratulations on making up your mind to quit  Keep your head up  Hey hey westyman  Good to have some more company for the trip      I'm not drinking right along with you  mate  I'm genuinely happier to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all  She took me places I never thought I could go      That's enough melodramatic whining from me  a real miserable Monday problem has just reared its head  I thought I had another bottle of whiskey  I don't   It got harder before it got easier  5mo just happened to be the hardest time for me thus far  I couldn't drink but I was miserable  I didn't have the tool yet to react differently to life so I was creating the same problems for myself and then blaming them on external factors   Somewhere around that time the Joe and Charlie speaker tapes taught me about resentments  I look at how that played out in my life as a spiritual breakthrough of the educational variety today  I came to believe that someone might wrong me but Everytime I replay that wrong in my head it's on me  That as much as anything else helped me deal with my war PTSD but also I think it might have been the start of the first time in my life where I've ever truly taken responsibility for my own emotions   Anyway  I was hoping someone like you was out there  Want to stay in touch   I was in your situation a little over two years ago   This sub and AA helped me get and stay sober  How big are you  I could never see myself putting that much down a day  despite my best efforts anything over a litre usually puts me to sleep  I can't second this enough  Doing tasks when I was having cravings  or was bored  or when I feel helpless got me through  and still does today  Some people work out  I clean  Early on when my mind wouldn't leave me alone and all I wanted after work was to drink I would swiffer the floors like they'd done me wrong instead  It burns off energy  refocuses my thoughts  and my house gets clean    Thanks for sharing  to all those starting out  I concur this helped me a lot   You're right about this  but I can only delay watching when I truly believe that the relapse will bring negative effects  When I'm very lonely and I'm procrastinating on my study  it's easy to fool myself  Mastering the art of resisting comes from doing something else to procrastinate on watching porn  Most of us watch porn to procrastinate on something else  All the stuff you just mentioned but also girls guys getting pictures uploaded of them doing shit so that they appear 'perfect' and that their lives are awesome  You know like constantly uploading pictures up like that You're words are my little bit of confidence right now  Thank you  Nope  not gonna do it   I will NOT drink with you today   Go ahead and ban me by IP     Such a joke  I can see you have no clue how any of that works by posting this  I'm a really unstable drunk  If something good happens I'm loving it  everything is my friend and everyone is a wonderful person  If something bad happens  I'm a moody and miserable piece of self harming shit    I've never hurt anyone while drunk  physically  anyway  besides myself  Defining success as "not drinking today" might help you build the confidence you say you lack  If you're peering too deep into the calendar  a week from now  a month  holy shit am I really not going to drink for the next decade       these imaginations of the distant future make confidence difficult  But just today  just this evening  I'm SURE you can do that    Days    Yet I'm not selling shit   Have you ever attempted this before     How long have you been binge drinking and the approximate amounts during these binges   I like this model  it still shows the progress and allows you to go "aw darn  my average went up  let's work hard to keep it down again"  rather than "fuck  I lost all my progress and the motivation to build up a streak again"  You also forgot to mention FebFast February   My suggestions  don't know if any of them are original      Parched March   Abstinence April    Moderation May  I pulled a rookie mistake yesterday and it truly hurt my soul  I ordered a 20oz Hefe and I was sipping it super slow  Next thing I know the check comes  I pack up the doggy bag and we leave  Forgot to finish half of my beer   Wtf  How does that happen   I beat myself up all day over it   Feeling a bit forlorn about the passage of time  but that won't be an excuse to drink today  Just picked up my 30 day chip  Good or bad  I will not drop no today   Oh  you poor thing  you're in a lot of pain  I'm so sorry you're going through this   Please don't make any irreversible decisions right now while you're in turmoil   Can you please call a helpline  I am not sure where you are  but there is a list of numbers  at https   www reddit com r SuicideWatch wiki hotlines  sorry  I don't know how to link   or perhaps speak to someone via the IRC on the sidebar   The only thing I can say is that you are NOT alone   So many people here have been in similar situations and have found a way out   It really can get better for you  this is not all there is   Please don't be ashamed or embarrassed   You have clearly recognised a problem and you've spoken up about it   that's incredibly brave and very very smart     Please stay here  read some of the posts  and keep posting yourself   You're not alone  we're here and no one will be judging you   Strong work right here   Is there someone in 3D you can talk to  Your doctor  A therapist    Suicidal thoughts should not be taken lightly and drinking causes depression  Believe me  I've felt what you're feeling and I believe it's a sign that you must do something different   it's a viscious cycle   You feel sad and depressed so you drink to feel better  You get drunk and do something you regret nd feel worse the next morning so you drink again    Wash Rinse Repeat   The cycle MUST be broken    Will you join me in not drinking today  Good shout  Only concern is  sometimes the high number has been enough to make me think twice about breaking it  I still think what you are suggesting is worth serious consideration  those are the situations I am most afraid of   Great job   Green Tea somehow does the trick   Happy 2017   Give it time   Didn't they just outlaw muslim garb  Have you noticed that your hangovers become less severe  when you don't smoke  Thank you for your reply  I went to AA for a few weeks around 5 years ago and you know what  I actually listened to the stories of other people and my fucked up mind believed I couldn't be an alcoholic cause I didn't do half the shit they had done  so therefore gave my self a pass to continue drinking  I like your idea of us both going tomorrow   I need to get through today and be strong enough to stay off alcohol tonight when I start to feel a bit better as this is when i will inevitably mess up and I dont want to  How have you managed your last 12 days  well done for that      My husband isn't as terrible as I may have led you to believe  He is very nice  he always thinks he's doing the best in every situation  I know that our daughter means more than anything to him  He has a job where he works completely alone in A pitch black basement for 11 hours a day for almost no pay  and he is almost definitely somewhere on the autism spectrum  Those two things together make for a somewhat stressful home Get rid of all your stuff and from then on if you think about  or have a craving  immediately try to recognize that and think of something else  Anything  Preferably something that you could be doing instead of smoking and go do it  Every time wanting to smoking pops into your head  just force yourself to shift your train of thought  Before you know it  you'll remember what it's like to live without it   I will not drink today  I will not drink with all of you here today  Proud to say my  my wife's and my  holiday season went as planned  Consequently I have nothing to say sorry for  nor am I embarrassed for any actions  deeds  or words said  If near 10 months of sobriety has taught me anything  and its taught me a lot  it has taught me that the world  I live in  is a  much  better place for my being sober  The problem with that is that I could be well over a year in days "pornfree" as I normally only looked at porn 2 3 times a week when I wasn't trying to kick it  That doesn't put me anywhere near where the people are who have gotten to 1 year  and it wouldn't put me anywhere close to a streak or actually removing porn from my life  So I will gladly reset my counter to 0 if I relapse again because I have reset my brain back to feeling the need of porn again  The counter wouldn't mean anything to me if I only lost a day when I relapsed  For me day 5 is when I feel good both physically and mentally  First 100 hours will be the worst feeling for me  Just hang in there  it does get better  Congratulations  that is a big deal man  If you don't mind me asking how long much did you smoke  I wonder if the amount and length of time of use before stopping is what is dragging out some people's physical recovery vs others  They didn't pack that in your doggy bag as well  I'd say the onus is on the eating establishment  I will not drink today   Good question  I still feel a sense of shame when thinking back on my lowest moments and I think to keep a small amount is healthy  But if it's all consuming the only thing I've found is time helps  and the longer I'm sober the better I feel about the things I did in the past because I redeem myself through not drinking  Even if it's just trying to stop and needing to try again and again you should feel proud you're doing something to change  That means you've learnt from your mistakes   Wow  that's amazing   Not only are you going to make 2017 a great year for yourself  you're going to be helping so many people as well   Congrats on the decision to do the course  And thank you  I know we already benefit from your wisdom and empathy

lost than to have never loved at all   Absolutely    It was an epic post I will join you all in not drinking this January 2  2017   Thanks for your comment  It's reassuring to see someone who realized what alcohol did to them and took action  Is life much happier now  Or  should I say stable  Feel like I'm a lost cause right now   I will  not drink today  no matter what   I will not drink today  On

cannot seem to find one I like  I use this and other subs like it to act as a sponsor  Probably not the best way to do it  but it is working for me    So glad you made the decision to NOT drink   It's a link to a well respected vendor and I even mentioned the daily list of vendors so people can do their owm research on where yo buy  Interesting idea  but it may over complicate the system  Also  I would personally reset relapse counter after maybe a year   Also  in some ways it makes a big deal out of relapse  that number staring at you  So it might mean you have less immediate relapses  But it could become a millstone  when a relapse isn't supposed to be the big deal   Thanks so much  Some great people on this sub  Right now I feel like rock bottom  but In truth  I've had so many rock bottoms over my life that i am so sick of it   I'll do it now  Better late than never   I think it the other way around Resetting  to zero upsets you too  On the other hand you could look at your progress and be proud of all the days where you did achieve your target   Also  similarly  if you'd be watching porn  you'd be willingly incrementing your relapse counter  It would be a real time realization of that you made that thing to increase  Sober Living is the BEST    I will not drink today   In  Not drinking today   That I'm an alcoholic  Thank you for your kind reply  I spoke with samaratins 2 weeks ago when I had made the decison that i couldn't live like this anymore  They were very nice but they can't change the way a persons mind works so ultimately the thoughts remain  I dont cope with things the same as other people and small things that happen push me to the edge  with only my children keeping me from falling completely  I have no doubt that my shame around drinking doesn't help one bit   I want to stop so badly  I'm just so scared of failing again     Try Sober Voices Phone Meetings 712 432 0075 Pin  654443  Everyday at 12 00pm EST   Evening at 10 00pm EST  I

physically addicted   I didn't know this and was still locked in denial when I quit sobstayee in bed for two weeks      I don't have comparable dry goods experience and the thing is every one is different so is what  our bodies tolerate    If I knew then what I known now I think rehab would have been a wise move  But I lucked into my sponsor and things worked out ok  I do have a talent for

come to see  Chairs bud Thanks for sharing  This is such a baffling and cunning disease   That we would knowingly put alcohol in our bodies thinking we are hurting no one else when we were hurting so many     In my opinion experience  quitting is something you have to decide to do on your own  Your brother may have to hit rock bottom and have some realizations before he decides to quit    Just don't give up on him  This post somewhat reminds me of myself  weed really did make me depressed and irritable every time I wasn't high  My boyfriend has hated my smoking for the past year  and after being 10 days sober I wonder how many fights would have been avoided if weed wasn't in the picture  Your post is quite eye opening  thank you and good luck to your brother  Yes  I Agree about the high numbers  instead here we would we increasing the value of relapse counter And no one would want that too reach a high value  Maybe you could go back and we if they kept it for you  Fuck That Shit  You're handling it better than I would haha  I wouldn't be happy with that at all  Respect   Thank you so much and right now drinking is the last thing I want to do  I need to find some strength to keep feeling this way and not to give in again  It is a vicious circle  depression drinking feeling shame  its also a massive habit  I am so used to drinking every evening it feels like a part of me is missing if i try not to  and I struggle to sleep if I'm not passed out from alcohol I am going to give it everything not to drink today  That's good to know  I felt great yesterday but maybe it was a mind over matter  I was so proud of myself for not drinking on NYE that my body felt great as a result of that     Today perhaps my body had decided to take more control of the situation    I had a shower and that helped considerably and boy  how good it felt to be able to wash off a phantom hangover as opposed to temporarily masking a real one with a cold shower only to have it come back tenfold an hour later    Thank you for your assistance   We got some Wanker in our sub fap  Been here  a few months  and now its OK to go around attacking Fash and  I  Nerve of some people   It took

can make you want to rip your hair out like a crazy person  and at the same time be the most awesome thing ever  I had no idea what being a parent was really like  So serious cudos to you Triple Jack  keep at it  I'll not drink with you today  Day 2  not drinking today  Waking up without a hangover fely amazing today and I don't want to lose that feeling tomorrow  I found that drinking masked my problems    Just because I got sober didn't mean I got a pass  I had to front up to all my financial stuff and the wreckage of my career    Luckily I was single   no kids     Have you found r alanon  That sub is full of folks who have been where you are  Nothing beats brown sauce   HP   it has to be HP   on a hotdog  Not sure if it's around where you are  certainly hope so  As an atheist   lol  I love that line  I'm appropriating it for future use  The nightly quantity isn't too extreme  but doing that every day is enough to wreck your liver if you are so disposed    ill have to figure out what to pack for a trip also wd and out of beer and only one shite benzo left  also got another email from mom that iam disappointment  That star looks great on you  Congratulations  To celebrate  I won't drink with you today   Back on the wagon after a bump in the road knocked me off last week  Not drinking  though  Fake I'm not so far in myself  so please take my advise with a pinch of salt   Unfortunately he really has to make the first step of his own accord  Pot may or may not be the cause of his depression  but he's certainly trying to use it to run from it   After a long time of smoking I admitted it was actually just making it worse  i was constantly zoning out picking myself apart  replaying scenarios in my head and beating myself up for my actions  Depression is really excarcebated by this  because you're not living in the moment    When he decides to quit again  make plans with him  keep him busy  away from his friends  the first few days are probably the hardest for cravings  For me it was mostly boredom or stress that makes me want to smoke  But after a week without it I saw objectively for the first time that smoking isn't going to make that better  You don't own trousers  One cannot survive in the penguin costume full time   at some stage it'll need a wash  I shall look forward to day ten in that case  and all the days after    It was relatively mild in comparison to what you seem to have gone through I think  Well done on making it out the other side    I guess we like to assume that stopping drinking will automatically mean we wake up on day one and everyday after feeling like daisies and with a spring in our step    The harsh reality is after years of abuse our body  and mind  is going to punish us for taking away what it craves and we'd be fools to expect we'll get an easy ride    But I'm ready for the ride   I went end of 2015 twice  but haven't since  The person I saw was starting to see things I didn't want to admit to and I stopped going  2016 then went to shit right away  I know I need to go again   I will not drink today And to attack you about your subject expertise as well  Dumb  Simply dumb  Dunno  if they did then that's a really stupid decision  Ok that makes sense  maybe it could also mask emotional problems but then how could you really tell I guess  Ah no I haven't but I will check it out  Thank you  I'm sorry to hear what you are going through  What about opening up to your brother and telling him how you feel  Is that an option  Inspiring For me  the fear of failing is huge   It's terrifying  almost so much that I couldn't even think about not drinking because I was scared that failure was inevitable and would tip me over the edge   It seems that for a lot of people here  myself included   alcohol misuse accompanies depression and other mental health issues   I know that I drink to avoid the depression etc  and I know that drinking also makes it so much worse   So it's hard to but the breaks on a cycle like that   Are you able to see a doctor about your drinking and how you're feeling about things at the moment   They may be able to help with support to detox  perhaps you can explore medication options as well   I did that a few weeks ago and it was terrifying  but worth taking that step   You are right that no one else can change the way your mind thinks  but there are tools and resources that can help you work through it yourself  It is possible to change the way you think  it really is  Congratulations on 72 hours  For me  it's been a journey of removing reminders of smoking as they come up  like if I'm taking a flight  I'll sometimes suddenly get a craving even it it's been some time since I quit  so be patient with yourself after this time as you may still find you are triggered to want a smoke out of the blue  If smoking was triggered by stress I like tinybuddha com to find articles to help me through  I would think so   but this is just my opinion   if THC is stored in your fat working out releases them into your bloodstream yes  but guess who comes next  Kidneys   excretion    So yes working out right before a test is a bad idea because you are releasing the THC  however doing it well ahead of a test OR when you don't care about a test would be a great way to get it out of your system    Also   I am training for a marathon right now and the running has been bringing up tons and tons of phlegm and tar from smoking and I can't think that this is anything but good    that shit shouldn't be in your lungs lol   I would cite this  I feel like a bad scientist not citing  but I'm being lazy so maybe someone else can chime in too     I will not drink today   Here you go  https   www reddit com r stopdrinking search q title 3Abored OR title

best thing out for yourself  I am keeping alcohol on hold  just over a week now  but only two beers in two weeks  and I feel like a different person  It's been a very cool experience   with a pen that had the logo for the medication on it   That's surreal  I would have been wondering if I was in a "Matrix" movie  Yeah  I remember having it a while ago when I was having 'a week of no drinking' that lasted a mere 3 days  and I felt short changed    'but hang on Mr Body  I'm doing a good thing here and I  didn't  pump you full out poison last night so why aren't you making me feel amazing when I wake up  Why do I feel almost as bad '   I guess it has become confused and just assumes it's going to wake up lame and crippled  A placebo effect of sorts    Thank you  It really feels worth it     I'm in  Congratulations on your year  The benefits seem to just keep coming  I am to please   Sometimes I'm just too lazy to post so I just put my story in the comments of someone else's   I'm now officially out of booze but duck it's Monday so I can always get more   A break is in order though as my livers starting to really hurt   Looking forward to a weed and Xanax filled day   Oh but those nips from the bottle were delightful and the Packers won yesterday and are the NFC champs      Oh but didnt you hear Fash and I are lying about that cause society just loves  CA  Junkies  It opens so many doors  for us that we cruise Reddit looking for shit to do  Unfuckingreal  I really hope hes ashamed of himself  And  Im not causing shit on Fash's oh wait your thread  haha by exposing him  Shit  he probably doesnt even know the History of this post even  Thank you    You are doing the right thing  Keep on being awesome  It likely has a lot to do with duration  quantity  body mass and metabolism  Your body has to process it like anything else  and it takes a while  However  it's the mental re wiring that takes the longest  You went from weed    happy to       happy to  good habits and decisions    happy   The stress is piling in a vicious way    but I won't have a drink today   This made me laugh  Thank you for your post  Gets me thinking SOBER  Day 6  I won't drink with you today   I am with you  Had a bit of a hard time falling asleep last night  but waking up felt good  I think it was just the face coverings that were outlawed   But I still find it hypocritical for a country that won't let you name your kid Adolf  Watery eyes reading your post  I see this is how it works  Call me sensitive but Im freaking happy for you and for us   Happy 2017 for us  I wont drink with you today  He actually wrote about it in his autobiography    along with many rants fueled by his use of LSD  I'd take the whole thing with a grain of salt   I will not drink today  Plus it's time to start counting calories and dropping these 30 or so pounds I really don't need   Well not everything can be flawless There's some good and there's some bad   I think  this will help us focus on the good  Hey  thank you so much  I've had counselling before but I'm definitely going to look into it again  In the past I was quite resistant because it bought bad memories into the present which id rather forget  but obviously burying things doesn't work otherwise I wouldn't be drinking so much  I can definitely relate to the 'just having a good time' thing too   Exercise is the best thing I can do to help myself  it's like a healthy form of self harm  lol  Happy and healthy life is definitely what I'm after  Thank you for sharing your experience with me x  Incredible  Congratulations on a year    Congrats on your year of keeping your promise to yourself  It has been a pleasure to be sharing this journey with you   I've done quite a bit of digging around and have come to my own conclusion that this is talking specifically about sociopaths  psychopaths  schizotypal people or just people with such a low IQ that they don't know the difference between right and wrong  Typically people who are acutely mentally disturbed disabled and continue to be so after they quit drinking   The Big Book was written about 4 years after the founding of "Alcoholics Anonymous"  Over those fours years they had hundreds if not thousands of men and women come to a very small number of AA groups and try the 12 steps  Because AA was not like it is today   widely published and promoted by rehabs and doctors   in the early days they'd only get "low bottom" alcoholics who had tried everything else and were desperate enough to gladly submit themselves to the rigours demanded by the 12 step program  Consequently from these desperate people they got really good results  it was very rare for someone to fail   to go back to drinking  But very occasionally they'd have a fellow come to the meetings with what we would call today an acute personality disorder or acute learning difficulties   In my seven years of recovery I've bumped into one or two  This is out of the many  many hundreds that I have seen come and go at several thousands AA meetings that I have attended  The 12 steps will never work for people who don't feel any guilt or remorse  who don't have any resentments  "Children of the Lie" M Scott Peck calls them  They are just not capable of the type of self examination required in step 4 and the on going self examination step 10 calls for  They simply cannot see how selfish they are  I once tried to sponsor one such individual  He had a drinking problem alright but he also had an acute personality disorder  He was literally unable to understand what to do in step 4  He simply didn't have the cognitive ability   in other words he was "constitutional incapable of being honest with  himself "  It wasn't his fault   "he was just born that way" as the Big Book put's it  But he was very much the exception  not the rule   Skip through a few pages until you get to page 65  Can you understand the table  Could you write something like that about the people in your life  Now turning over the page to page 67 third paragraph  can you put out of your mind the wrongs others have done to you and see your own mistakes  If you can answer yes then you are capable of being honest with yourself and the twelve steps could work for you  Whether or not they will work for you is an entirely different matter and rather depends on whether or not you choose to work them   most alcoholics myself included for many many years preferred to drink rather than work the steps   I have had other sponsees and many of them also fail at step 4 but it's not because they don't understand what to do  rather they just don't seem to be desperate enough  In time though  after a few more years under the lash of alcoholism many do come back with the desperation I eventually had to put pen to paper and they also make a start on actually doing the steps rather than pontificating over them  Sure  of course  All of the ones I had been avoiding by staying drunk for years  And the ones that staying drunk for years had caused   By being sober  I was making a choice to join the adult world  and start taking care of the issues before they explode into real problems   We call it "Cleaning up the wreckage of the past" and it is part of step 5   Once my head was clear enough to recognize the problems  I was able to handle them   It is part of the promises  "We will intuitively know how to handle situations which used to baffle us"   For you  however  I would HIGHLY recommend r alanon  It will not keep your Boyfriend sober  but it will help YOU deal with his being a drunk  Man  I totally get this post  My two kids are beyond bonkers at this point  and they don't go back until next Monday  I used to drink all the time after being triggered by my kids  Glad I don't have to do that these days  I usually have to walk out of the room for a few minutes and take a few deep breaths  or make a tea or something like you did  Congrats on 70  3XJackontheRocks  I had to focus on the similarities in other people's stories and not the differences  The differences are just my "yets"  the things I haven't done yet  I will not drink today  Will do  Thank you again  May I suggest reading "the naked mind"  It's not your fault you drink too much  The book will explain  You can change before anymore harm to you is done  I'm supporting you  We all are   I won't drink with you today   I will not drink today  The good thing about not drinking  is that you can react to those situations in much better ways when you're sober  as compared to when you aren't   Nope   Been binging over 10 years  Approximate amount varies  3 bottles of wine to whole bottles of vodka   Yes we can  I'm aiming for 30 days too coz then I hope the habit is broken    Edit  not suggesting I'll start again after 30 days  Just want a less scary goal for now   Congratulations on the new job  and thank you for the work you do  Thanks for being here and sharing your experiences with us too   I will not drink today no matter what happens  Found it on Amazon   I'll give it a try and report back   No more fiends in 2017  Hear  hear  Hey  I've tried the EMDR too  I think it definitely helped some of the trauma from being so 'emotional' and freed me to be able to talk about my experience objectively  In the past I was resistant to counselling because it bought back memories but I now realise if I'd just dealt with those feelings at the time I probably wouldn't of dragged them around for so long  I'm going to look into therapy at work  also I know when I'm working out physically my mental health is sooo much better   Thanks for sharing your experience with me  I really appreciate it    Switzerland is my favorite country  which I have visited in my life   yeah fuckin A that's bang on what happened to me every relapse  I learned there is a quieter  patient  more thoughtful  and considerate person under all the boozy bravado  I learned that when I don't constantly seek other's approval  I leave some space to work on being a better me   I am not drinking today   Staying strong and I will not drink today  In those first few weeks I was googling  "one day sober"  "two days sober"  "n days sober" to see if I was on track  Reading whatever I could  I found r sd around day 20  maybe my google skills as not so good  I had no designs on a dry 2016  just a dry January  I don't know your drinking history  but there is a reason this is called recovery   My mantra in 2016 while kicking alcohol to the curb was "health and wealth"  I got there one day at a time  I won't be drinking w you today  thank you    I have an appointment with my doctor to hopefully get my anti anxiety medication changed  I will not drink today  I've always liked that quote too  I relapsed so many times thinking  "well  shit  I've never really made a huge mess of my life  I've never been arrested  I've never lost my job  wife  house  etc   " I had to learn that everyone has a different bottom  and it all depends on where you stop digging   Oh man  those post alcohol shits   mine smell like nail polish remover or something  yeap shes great though and so was i untill alcoholism  I read a book called "Waiting  A Non Believer's Higher Power" published by Hazelden that really helped me wrap my head around the steps without the God language  I consider myself a pretty strong agnostic and I've been helped tons by AA  by the community aspect but especially so by working the steps  If you are willing to work the steps  you will quickly see what they mean about those who are willing to be honest versus those who aren't  Try talking to a person who is drinking himself to death yet still thinks he doesn't need to change anything about how he lives his life and you will see a man who is incapable of being honest with himself    I promise you  if you go in looking for things to disagree with  you will find them  If you go in looking for things that can help you  you will find them too  I've learned that which ones I focus on is a decision I can make  I for one am glad that I chose to ignore the G word and get to work   Nailed it  Right with you  What will you do differently this time when the urges hit  I'm glad you've figured out the pattern  but that was only half the battle for me  Best wishes  I stayed up most of the night and am now kicking myself because I want to be asleep still  It's so warm under my blanket  '  No one's fault but my own though    I don't know if we have a meeting today because of the holidays etc  I'm going to pull a lazy ass repeat of last Tuesday and just throw a hoodie on and pretend to be presentable  At least my hair looks nice since I dyed it yesterday    All my roommates  none of whom work etc  were asleep by midnight and their lazy asses are still in bed    I'm apparently the only one who gives a fuck that we're supposed to be ready by 0900  Oh well  they're about to get woken up by the lights because it's 0845 and I need to find my clothes    I broke my wonderful streak of two months of no puking  but I think it was a fluke tbh  I took a drink and I guess my brain was not expecting it and I choked and gagged on it and blam  It was not the violent dry heaving I'm used to and I didn't feel sick after so I'm just going to chalk it up to swallowing too much at once  Jesus fuck this entire paragraph sounds bad out of context       I devoured an entire box of the triangle parmesan garlic Triscuits and they cut up the roof of my mouth somehow  Now everything burns    I have to decide today if I'm going to keep my phone with Verizon  which is shitty here and like  15 more  or go switch to metro PCS  no idea how shitty the service is here but it's cheaper   The main dilemma for me is that I actually like this phone and I'm very  very particular about customising my phones and I don't want to give it up now    Aaaaaand I'm procrastinating getting ready  I'm sorry you have that feeling of failure despite all those sober days your rockin' self accumulated   To me  this night sounds like an inadvertant success   After all  you were able to reencounter many aspects of alcohol which now abhor you   And no major harm done  fortunately   I bet you are excited to give this another shot     We are in this together   I won't drink with you today  Have you tried talking to your doctor  You may have a chemical imbalance that could be treated by a different medication  If you are on medication or plan to start medication  especially anti depressants or mood stabilizers  you should be on them sober so you can let your body adjust and know how you feel  Good luck  We're coming for you  Liverpool  You're attack is amazing  but your defense is dogshit  Generally speaking I like Germany  besides Aachen   they're basically the same as the British  Just have the occasional tendency to go insane once in a while   Banning the hijab is a reactionary and disrespectful move though  It's also contrary to their constitution  which is supposed to be based upon the most liberal  freedom of movement and expression laws ever created   I'd be surprised if that's enforced  sounds more like headlines for someone trying to make a name for themselves  Yep  another day Day 6 here  We got this  I won't drink with you today   Checking in  Day 6  I won't drink with you today  I wish I had done this   He told me he shared with his buddies his desire to stop drinking  and it was a repeated lie   In fact  when one of them came over while he was drinking and I referred to his drinking being a problem and a threat to my safety  the friend looked awkward and completely caught off guard   Meanwhile  I was hiding all of this from my friends and family because I was ashamed   I felt so isolated  and I think if it had been out in the open sooner  I would have gotten out sooner  because he just wasn't interested in getting better   Yes  many addicts  mine included  do not want others to know   I would argue that if I had to deal with the consequences of being at the mercy of his untreated  by choice  disease  the least he could do is allow honesty about what I was going through   It would have saved me years of living a double life on his account   Yes  it is likely that he would have refused sharing  but had I thought to bring this up  it would have been the thing that allowed me to stand up for myself when I was feeling so lost and out of control   And if the forced issue of him sharing was his hard line  I would have confronted so much sooner that this was not someone I could be with  the amount of numbers i know back to front is one of my biggest fail points   i couldn't delete them   all the best to you my friend  keep fighting  Abstinence April   I like that   I will not drink today    I didn't force myself to stay in on NYE just to turn around and drink alone two days into the new year     Hope things are getting a little easier for you   Hang in there   We've got your back  Way to go  there's some great honesty here  Defense looked at little better against city but don't disagree that it is the Achilles ankle of Liverpool  yeah netflix marathon FTW  literally only thing i could do for 4 days  too sick to even get up and score   edit  all of the suggestions here are excellent  big fan of loud music  got really into Macklemore on this recent kick  Most of my friends are big drinkers and great people  everyone has been supportive of my quitting  and no one makes a big deal about drinking around me  which  for me  makes it really easy not to drink  The thing is  drunk people suck to be around  My pals and I went out to an event a couple weeks ago  and I had to bail before the after party because by that point everyone's mood had changed  suddenly everyone was very into talking about how bad their childhoods were  everyone was getting a little aggro about misunderstandings  and misunderstandings were happening a lot  because everyone was so focused on their personal drunk crises   All this to say that "fun" drinkers really aren't unless you're one of them  You might find that yourself in my position  extricating yourself from social situations once the same story about your friend's mean mum is told for the fourth time that night  It feels pretty great being sober enough to know when to leave the party  highly recommended     So sorry to hear this  Sobriety might not help get it back  but it will help with this not happening again  Best wishes  Me too   Oh my  me too  One that doesn't always have to worry about my next move   The best  I think Merkel was feeling the heat from her immigration policies and had to throw a bone to the fascists  That is really interesting  thanks for clarifying what it means     I don't do AA  at this stage  but i am not ruling it out   but I started reading the Big Book a few days ago  I figure there's no point dismissing something I haven't read  and so many peole here have gotten value from it  so I'd be silly not to check it out  right     Anyway  I admit I found that notion of being 'constitutionally incapable of being honest with themselves' a bit hard to get my head around  so it's useful to hear your perspective on it   Out of interest  the Big Book is very much written in the style of it's time   do you know if there are any updated interpretations  or newer versions that are worth looking into   Macklemore   Starting Over  Interesting that the urges came back strong after almost half a year   You mentioned that you have made a lot of progress but how are the urges if they arise now and what actions do you take to cope with them  Checking In    Johny Cash   Hurt  I think you mean Nine Inch Nails    Yaaas girl  5 months sounds like forever from where I'm standing  so thanks for the encouragement that it can be done  GO YOU  It's surprisingly easy to quit  just make sure you do something during the times that you normally smoke so you never think about it   I found the benzo quit easier too  Or else I've just forgotten how bad it was  I think I've been so out of it on many of my addictions I didn't have the brain calls left to even accurately observe WD's   I get into this annoying state of mind about kratom  all wine and roses  and start really missing it  Although I've only hit this snag since I ran out of BSO  Have some on order to arrive tomorrow  but I've pretty much decided to track some down at the health food store TODAY  This is ridiculous  I'm right there with you  It's my day 2 also  I will not drink with you today  Yeah  I hate changing phone services  Of course they know that too  Maybe call up Verizon and tell them you are switching unless they offer a discount  Sometimes works    My kids start back at school tomorrow morning    in 23 5 hours   but now   to survive today  Hello fellow empath  I love you  too   I'm so happy neither one of us is smothering our true selves with alcohol right now     I will be sending you loads of healing vibes     And hey  I'm proud of you     Thank you  I considered that last night or the night before I can't remember  but Im just so afraid of admitting this to him or anyone  I am going to get through today and go to AA meeting as soon as I can  Many of us drank heavily for years  then found out that when we were sober we had a big pile of mental problems right in front of our sober faces  Stopping the booze just brought these problems to the surface and forced us to acknowledge them  they were always there  the booze hid the problems  it did not cause them  This is often made worse because alcohol has the effect of stunting emotional growth  leaving many of us as teenagers mentally  I found that being active in recovery forums combined with councelling  exercise  good diet and spending a lot of time reading recovery material helped me a great deal   The fact that he used to drink and now doesn't should not be used as an excuse to treat you poorly   A jerk is a jerk  dry or not   Thanks for the reply  i am fairly new to reddit   I have to sadly admit that I gave in at the last minute   Ten minutes before the liquor store closed I ran over and got a mickey of jager and a small bottle of johnny walker   The hangover was pretty bad   Weirdly enough  I dont feel like a complete failure for drinking   I dont plan on drinking again  but the lure of new years eve got to me    In those first two months of sobriety I had thick brain fog that forced me to keep lists to remember many trivial types of things  My brain fog lifted on day 53  Best wishes  Well fuck  that defeats my whole argument  Cheers to your mom  Joel MAtip is pretty good at Centre back  And  you still have Steven Caulker  a Tottenham youth trained defender    and for some reason Caulker never gets gametime  like never  It's so weird  because he's a very good defender   What would I do in that situation when I already had therapy for 4 years and just had my last session  In my country I am now required to have a 2 years break before I can start seeing any therapist again   I basically feel the same as OP  I have recently doubled my SSRI dosage after about 3 years on the same dosage  as told to by a doctor    its been about 3 weeks since i doubled the dosage though thought they shouldve taken effect by now I'm at work  with no coffee  no food  cause the cafe is closed today  on what should be a corporate holiday   But the supreme overlords dictated that we have to be here   So I will take it  spend time reading random stuff in reddit  and sleep with my eyes open   But I won't drink today     FTZ   One thing I'm starting to appreciate is that a constitution means whatever the people who are willing to ignore it want it too mean if they are in the majority   Consider Japanese internment camps in the US  I will not drink today  Hey  that isn't how drug tests work dude   Read the directions for it   A faint line means that you PASSED   The line is either there or it is not there   It is a 1 or a 0   A yes or a no   The line being faint doesn't mean there was "some" opiates in your urine   At home instant drug tests don't really display nor determine whether there was a little or a lot of the substance present   They display and determine a strict yes or no   A faint line does not mean the presence of opiates   This is a really common misconception   Most people believe that faint lines mean that there was some of the substance present which is not true at all   People need to read the instructions   Please have your girlfriend read the instructions and my post if need be   Please let me know how things work out   Also  eating three poppy seed bagels should not cause you to fail an at home instant drug test   That isn't nearly enough to trigger the test  I know you can do it  I personally listened to recovery podcasts my entire first day and it helped tremendously  I'm almost at a week  no urges whatsoever  and feeling great  Just know that you are not alone in this journey  hmm  sorry to hear that  this is the first time we've tried giving away promo codes for an in app purchase  Its quite a new thing from Apple  How's it going so far OP  Congratulations  This is very inspiring    There's nothing quite as sad as seeing a person stay the exact same after many years  Especially when they don't even enjoy where they are  Lack of personal development  I think Merkel was doing an incredibly humanitarian act  yet some pencil chaser slipped that in on the side   Hey  thank you so much for sharing your story and congratulations on your sobriety  The guilt is what upsets me the most too  I'm lucky to have an amazing partner but that does make me feel all the more bad  But that's also my main motivation for giving up so it works both ways    thanks again   Can I ask why you don't feel comfortable seeking out help from a therapist   Have you been to one before   I'm such a big fan of therapy   Here's why  this is what they have studied for  this is their area of expertise   Friends are amazing  but I don't know that it is fair to ask a friend  presumably close to your age  to be the primary source of comfort and advice about something this huge   Alcoholism  addiction   these are diseases so complex and damaging and distressing that they are fields of study  huge groups have formed in reaction to coping with them  AA  Al Anon    Even my dear friend  who is in her mid 30s and herself married to a recovered alcoholic  simply will not be as good as a therapist because she isn't trained  is very familiar with what worked for her and her husband's situations but not all addiction  and she has a life of her own and problems of her own   I lean on her and she is s source of comfort  but a therapist can offer so much more   Addiction can be ugly and embarrassing and shameful and horrific   Going to tell my therapist about all of those things  is so much easier than sharing all of that with the friend  or watering down the story to make the friend or me feel more comfortable    This isn't going to be easy  I'm afraid  so I suggest getting all the help you can   trusted friends  therapists  Al Anon meetings  read books about being the child of an addict   Do it all  Thank you for your support  it means so much  I will get a hold of this and read it  I read the Alar Carr stop drinking book about a year and a half ago and managed to stop for about a week then gave in to temptation the following weekend after a good bad day just an excuse to drink  I felt such a failure that so many people had managed and yet again I had failed  it was an excuse to drink more  I stopped trying after that until now   Your thoughts on attending AA    I'm not an AA member but was curious on your thoughts of using their method of getting sober  I tried them in the beginning but then went onto creating my own system of re wiring my mind and changing my perception of alcohol   This system works for me  You'll have to find what works for you  You will be dealing with  severe cravings in the beginning  There's no sugar  coating it  As time goes on it gets easier     whyquit com  http   whyquit com john stop smoking cravings tips embracing crave episodes html I had a lot of respect for her as well   Maybe you're right   Maybe it was a compromise as part of a larger package deal   I hope so  Hey  me too  I grew up with alcoholism in my family too  Ironically  despite all the pain it created in my life  I ended up down a similar path  I'm now sober too  Now that I've worked steps though I've become involved in family meetings   There we remind people of the three C's  which are  1   We didnt cause it  it is not our fault that the other person drinks  it is their private battle 2   We cant control it  we have no power over the other person's desire to drink 3   We cant cure it  it is an illness that cannot be cured through any known medical remedies   Getting involved in meetings and stepwork is what saved me from my own despair  Consider actually attending meetings in your area  they may even have AlaTeen depending on where you live   Also therapy with your dad can be helpful I imagine  When I was out using my wife and parents did a couple sessions  It seemed to be helpful and eventually I came to my own place of action  put my hand out  and asked for help   Good luck to you in the new year  This is just like me  I have failed before and I use that as a reason not to try because the failure makes me feel like even more of a useless waste  I am scared of going to doctors  simply for the reason of my kids and job  I couldn't bear to lose either  if I did I would be dead within about a week I'm sure  Im going to try AA again  I can't go on like this anymore  I will not drink with you today  SD  No matter what happens  I will not drink  Day 9  here I come   speaking for myself   my attempts to quit kept me drunk and sick  As hard as it seems  SURRENDER to any power greater than me is the only thing that worked   I don't drink  I surrender  That's it    Tea is my BFF   Add a little honey and mmmmmmm  Proud that you saw the evening for what it was and went to bed sober  I hope everyone is well rested today  I will not drink today  Good morning  I will not drink with you all today  This article makes it sound like she's all for it   http   www bbc com news world europe 38226081 Not going to drink today no matter what life throws my way  Actually  he has already made a post here and we dealt with it in modmail  Your comments in this thread are fine  because it's miserable Monday related  but please keep the drama out of the rest of CA   I know you haven't posted elsewhere in the sub about it  this is just a modly announcement for everyone's benefit   Cheers    I always get sick a week or two after kicking   Thank you for your post  Taking time to inspire another human is an act of LOVE  I'm glad your here 1 2 2017 to share your story to this 6 day girl  Thank you   I won't drink today with you  Remember 1 day at the time   Well  the dosage and amount she's using does in reality matter most of all  The rest of it is subjective moralizing  Sorry  just my two cents   Just try being gentle and understanding with her  And    communicate  It's going to be a great year   You don't have to apologize for the the length of any post  We are so happy to have you sharing with us   Welcome  back  to the ride of your life  and the best group of people to weather through it with   I get the appeal of wanting to do it at home because its more comfortable  but everytime I tried to do it myself I just fell back into old habits after a few days because nothing else had changed    Unfortunately getting out of your comfort zone and being around those strangers might be the best thing for you  it gives you a chance to get information you may not have and to see for yourself what can happen at every stage of the game  I know when i saw the guys who had been at this for 40 years I didnt judge them but I knew I also didnt want that to be my life   Everyones path is different  but growing doesnt happen where your comfortable  Maybe think about trying something outside of it    Either way good luck  and stay strong Great job  momma   No  I have leggings and a few pairs of jeans but they're too big  I prefer dresses etc    But undergarments  I have bras  That's it   I totally trust that  Ahaha     I love you too  I won't drink with you today  Instead I'm going to focus on healing  Stay good to yourself  Happy 2017 Ok  well good luck  The  stopdrinking IRC chat is also a pretty good place to get support  as I am discovering   What a well told inspiring tale  I am glad you are here  Very motivating and inspiring to this sober drunk  Thank you so much  I'm going to just forgo ONE drink   The First One So far cleaning has gotten me through the morning smoke   appreciate the advice    I will not drink today  Hes a Very angry drunk  You guys gotta keep an eye him  And although he called me out you dont see me doing the same  I dont know how thats OK here M  Clear Year  Not sure if it's been suggested as well  but the The 30 Day Sobriety Solution has been amazing for me this time around  I listen to the audio book every day and I follow the steps they give me  I'm amazed at how much easier it's been quitting this time   A fellow SDer recommended it to me on Xmas day and I haven't looked back     I too have three kids  I too used to drink every single nighta bottle plus of wine  Granted  I am only 9 days in today  but I feel so much better  so much more solid  And they can feel that way for you as well   I wish you all the strength and love you need right now  Don't go too hard on yourself  Shame is what often makes us drink so much  Please go get some help  whether it's downloading the book I recommended or reading The Naked Mind or I hear both at the same time works wonderfully   You got this  but you have to want this  Willpower is only part of it  loving yourself and figuring out WHY you drink is also a big part of it   So much love to you  Be good to yourself   I have to remember that every day I don't smoke is a win   It is overwhelming because I feel like I've lost part of my identity    but that is not a bad thing at all  Random drug testing   Kidding  I'm a photographer or something  I will not drink today  I can't believe how much I love my life now that I have left alcohol behind    Thank you all for being here today  Indeed   I only need to see as far as the headlights   and  have Faith in the face of Uncertainty  Powerful post  u DidntDrinkAgain  Thank you for sharing  On the day you checked into the hospital  I was having my last drinks  I'm glad you are recovering  although I'm sorry you are still have some residual side effects  Let's keep this sober journey rolling along  sign me up Just one hour at a time  my friend  You are powerful and can overcome this  We need you here  and the world wouldn't be the same without you   When I notice my Actions  I've prepared my self to consciously choose   Why is there so many excuses for drinking    Because people with alcohol problems are very creative and motivated to find these excuses  I had a million of them  and stayed dependant on alcohol for way to many years    How do you stop the excuse making    Thats the tricky part  If you read as much as you can here at  SD you will find many ways people stopped making excuses and stopped drinking  You can stop drinking if you want to  It is up to only you to do it  not your girlfriend  Your drinking is your choice not anything to do with her    Thanks so much  I'll post again in a few days  Have a crazy busy week that I hope will keep me distracted for the most part   So far just repeating "I don't need this  I don't want this" over and over has been helping as I work past what would normally be my morning blaze  You've got this  Almost there  You lucky bastard  haha  Congrats to you too eh   It's true  I want this  I need to stay focused  When I feel down or ready to cave    I need to remember I wanted this  I will not drink today   Those are some great milestones  congrats   i've been there   hope you're able to replace your stuff with minimal difficulty  Just to follow that thought  and I am not saying I have the answer  by any means   I am clueless myself  just muddling through   I can see how you feel that going to a doctor might affect you keeping your kids and job   But perhaps NOT doing that might lead to the same outcome  or something worse   I can't tell you what to do  but perhaps instead of a doctor  you could talk to your brother   do you trust him to understand and not judge     I know it's tricky with family  so I won't assume he can offer the support you need   you should trust your judgement on that   If nothing else  we're here for you  and coming here is a great start     You're doing brilliantly already just by talking about it  so don't underestimate your bravery or strength   And I will not drink with you today if you want  Been quite a few days now   Feels like an eternity   Seemed impossible at day 3 but getting to visit the family  after a year  has definitely helped too  I will not drink again  I will not drink with you today  I think it's already as cheap as possible  unfortunately  I went around and around with them already because they messed up porting my number and also lied to me about the data  who the fuck sells a smartphone with literally NO DATA  I don't mean it was slow or cost overage fees    My phone literally only got on wifi and had no option for mobile data whatsoever until I gave them an additional  15  Considering I'm on the bus for a few hours a day sometimes  and the buses here don't have WiFi like back home    That was a pretty big issue    I loved Verizon when I had them a few years ago but not so much lately     I relate to all of this op  mostly I'm struggling with a lack of direction  I've never known what I wanted from life  any time anything peaks my interest I get bored eventually and make excuses not to persue it  My brother is vegetarian and used to order McDonalds cheeseburgers without the meat  Also  YOU are not a complete mess  Alcohol has a way of making us believe we are a complete mess  The cycle for me was so simple  drink a lot  pass out  wake up in the middle of the night hating myself because of how much I drank  vow not to drink the next day  wake up with the intention of not drinking  by three PM  I'm at the liquor store because all the negative thoughts about drinking fade away    What is helping me this time is realizing every time I want a drink  and I do   is that happy awesome feeling I get when I initially start  It lasts for such a short time  I spend the remaining time chasing that happy feeling and in turn start feeling even shittier and shittier    It's not you  It's booze    You can do this  I did a sixty day taper  God it was terrible  A couple of great benefits to it though  in that you can  somehow  keep functioning just about  The big benefit for me though was it was so horrible  just the thought of it has stopped me relapsing  Hang in there  You can't force someone else to quit    he has to take the steps himself or it will not work    sorry     I can't drink anymore or I could die  so the decision was easy    Most  heavy drinkers that have to make a change experience  what you're dealing with  Most have to find something to keep them busy for the first few months   Once you take the drinking hobby  out of the equation other interest just seem to pop up     It takes time and it's not easy  Sorry to hear this  but yeah  sounds about par for the course  Kratom is such an absolute bitch   Oh yeah  fancy   I'll look at the schedule  I've enjoyed the evening meetings at Westport Baptist near where you stay  Id for sure recommend   one of my 2017 goals is to attend as many new meetings as possible  so perfect time for you to ask      Then why do you want to quit if it's so great   Check the side bar of this sub  you can download This Naked Mind for free   It sounds like you just went in expecting sobriety from weed to cure everything  A lot of people  myself included  have made this mistake  You need to be actively trying to improve yourself daily  Look for a job  Work on your resume  Its not gonna fall into your lap because you decided to quit weed  Weed is a huge de motivator for me and I know stopping won't magically motivate me  Give it some more time  I had been sober for 5 months at one point and I was feeling the same way around the 1 2 month mark  I won't drink today Are you doing a stable scheduled and measured taper  It sounds kind of chaotic  I could see how that would just throw your whole system into a state  Hope you did it  It was my first day too and I did not drink with you  Not drinking with you today either     Do you know 'about' how many teaspoon 20 grams is  I still haven't gotten a scale  Im stuck on my taper  Holidays didnt help  Reading all these posts scare me since Im a long time user  9 years  ugh   Good for you    It took me a long time to be able to change my habit of daily drinking  and smoking     Although my badge only says 7 days  I was alcohol free for 29 31 days in December  I only slipped up around the holidays and only drank a few beers each time    However  my goal is lasting sobriety so there's still work to be done    Let me know if I can help in any way  For me  it's not the big ticket items  It's being able to spend here and there on hobbies and eating out without experiencing any of the anxiety and remorse that I experienced before because I I had been terrible with money and spending so much on booze  Being able to spend  50 on something fun without cringing in the slightest is pretty amazing     A sexually abusive relationship     An undiagnosed anxiety disorder     How poorly I was balancing my life because of the two He's saying he has quit and he wants knows he has to defeat it  I'm just wondering what steps I can take to push him in the right direction  Surely people who have quit also receive support from other sources and not just from their will power alone   Yay  My star finally turned 4    Today  I will add another day of not drinking   I'd happily use it once or twice a week  But I know I'd get into a mind set where I was just trying to get through the shitty non kratom days  It's so not worth it  I will not drink today  Sounds almost like she's on extracts   that for sure is not good  I would just ask her nicely without attacking  us addicts can be very defensive  I love this  A few years ago  I decided to stop using the phrase  "I'm busy" as an excuse for why I couldn't wouldn't do something  This post helps to further articulate my opinions on how we spend our time and why   No drinking for me today either   I've got too much to look forward to     Good job  and great advice I bought myself a few little gifts to mark one month of sobriety   a new fountain pen and some gorgeous inks   Calligraphy is the reason I gave up smoking a year ago  it's difficult to smoke and write at the same time   and now that I've stopped drinking I am far more focused and less shaky  so my writing has improved loads   I also find that calligraphy allows me to clear my mind  and it's a great way to avoid the creeping boredom in the evenings that usually led me to the bottle   Plus  it's super satisfying  I wouldn't see any reason to force yourself up after eight hours  I naturally sleep a lot more in the long nights of winter  Do you feel groggy from too much sleep or does it feel like the right amount for you  Are you in a wintery area  It may be to much medicine and your body still adjusting to being without buds  Stay strong and talk to your doctor's again  Suicidal homicidal thoughts are side effects of ssri type meds  I will not drink with you today  That was my New Year's Resolution actually   Doing okay so far  but I worry about what will happen once I'm back at work given my picking gets way worse when I'm stressed   I had never actually heard of liquid bandages  but they sound awesome and I'm going to pick some up ASAP   Good luck to you  You weren't alone   Awesome and all the best in the new year  I will not drink today  I'm right there with you  Message me if you wanna talk tips or anythinf  anytime  Good luck  let's make 2017 our bitch  Yeah  the hilarious part is how we all  at one point or another  thought we were hiding it or it wasn't  that  noticeable  I've come across things I haven't worn washed since I quit and every time I'm like "holy shit  I smelled like one of those giant cans you see outside businesses that are just overflowing with butts and trash"  I choose not to drink today   I had some of the worst nightmares I have ever had when I quit smoking  L I feel for you  know that this gets better soon x  Not drinking today  Hello all  I am sitting on 87 days and choose not to escape reality today  At the very least you can save some money by buying your booze in larger bottles and cut out the bar drinking    I feel you  I had to just plain throw out my tweezers because I couldn't take it anymore   I use a facial trimmer for my eyebrows   It's like a small electric razor   Cutting a hair isn't as efficient as plucking it  but if you really need to stop the tweezer addiction cold turkey it gets my recommendation  The trick for me was to learn to identify and not compare  I was the same way   until I realized the feelings they were talking about were the same as I was having  AA saved my life in large part because I understood I was not as different as my inner addict wanted me to think I was  Yeah MN winter sucks   It was a cold walk to the tavern last night and the snow wrecked my hair  I will not drink today     I made it through day 1  I will not drink today    Hey  you made it through your first two weeks that were also THE TWO HARDEST WEEKS OF THE YEAR to avoid drinking  with Christmas and NYE badgering you to grab a glass mug tumbler  Congrats  Keep going    I will not drink today  I will not drink with all of you today  have a great one  With you   Day 2  I was so depressed in the midst of drinking that I just didn't care if I lived or died  Today  so early in my recovery  I already feel so different  I actually feel the fog clearing  and my body healing  Yes  it's hard  But our bodies want to heal  and are amazing at doing it pretty darn quickly  Now I care very much about my life and health  my family and friends  and I care about you  It will happen for you too  You've taken the first step  you see  You are NOT gone  You are here  among friends  Fight hard  You can do it  You CAN  His post was removed  your comments remain  You seem to have some reading comprehension problems today  Thank you so much  Im going to do this right now  I definitely feel you about bandaids   I pick at my fingers till they bleed  and that's when I feel compelled to put a bandaid on   It works to heal the area but as soon as it's off and I feel that dry flakiness again  I just pick at it again    it's a horrible cycle   To try to help myself  I've used moisturizer whenever my hands felt dry  hoping it'd smooth over all the problem areas and reduce the compulsion   I've tried foul tasting nail polish too  because I often pick with my teeth   Recently my newest tactic has been trying to fidget with something else once I catch myself having the urge  because for me it's largely a nervous habit   These things haven't cured me completely  but I think it helps little by little   It's just a matter of remembering to do it before you do too much damage to your fingers  which is the hardest part by far  Yup  including one from myself a few weeks ago    i have really gotten into skincare  so I splurge on products or services  when i was drinking i could barely look in the mirror  After 5 weeks i find my skin is looking better and I am sure the extra attention is helping a lot   That shit was ridiculous    Sugar and heroin pills dissolve the same  didn't you know   I'm just making up this thing called solubility of course  The fact that I spent years in an actual fucking laboratory means nothing  I just need to go get a spoonful of sugar because that's definitive proof of his claims      And you've wasted all your drugs all these years  WHY AREN'T YOU HEATING THEM UP    Lolol  I don't know if you've ever even seen oxy tbh       And none of us are addicts or have any idea what we're talking about    Why the FUCK would someone pretend to be an addict and would y'all 2 deal with modding the other sub  which can be an absolute zoo   I don't mean that in a bad way  but it's a lot of work  just for shits and giggles  Like    Are you fucking kidding me   This  Having one drink has zero appeal to me  In fact  it sounds awful because it means that I'd have to stop myself after one  Zero is so much easier than one  Well done my friend  well done indeed  The valium will keep you alive if you have enough of it and don't drink while you're taking it  that can kill you    The good thing about valium is it has a long half life so it's easier to get off of it because it's somewhat self tapering   I'm not sure what the daily dosage would be to keep someone at your level from having alcohol withdrawal seizures though  I feel you   My dad especially likes to hound me for my finger picking   One time he got mad at me for doing it at a goddamn  restaurant  and it hurt me so much it was hard not to cry in front of the waitress   It's so exhausting trying to explain why I can't just "stop " Not drinking today   Checking in Most of the time I would say I'm groggy and takes me a while to wake up  But sometimes it's not always like that  I don't know  I'm so up and down mood wise  I can't seem to level out   It has been unseasonably warm where I am at  I live off the coast of the southern states in the us  It's been 60 70s  When normally it's in the 40s or cooler   You said you'd be accepting sign ups for the next 14 days and I commented yesterday  day 1  and have been p free for exactly one day      Maybe I said it wrong  please sign me up  Dayum Smokey     Even I'm not that salty this morning  Well played  I didn't see the January one in here    been clean one day already  so please sign me up  I won't drink with you today  Like with all things in my life  when I go to meetings I try to go with an open heart and absorb what speaks to me  With a respectful smile  I set aside what doesn't  That includes a lot of the capital G god references  This is my part of my spiritual path and practice  to make use of what cultivates my empathy and compassion  and set aside with a benign respect what doesn't   But after six months  it's funny how my perspective on some of these outdated Big Book passages have changed  Any West World fans out here  I can see now there are some blind spots in me just like the WW hosts  After some programming updates  I'm beginning to notice doors and clues where I didn't see them before  and some of the stuff I'd set aside earlier is beginning to speak to me even though I'm coming at it from a different perspective  I think setting things aside with benign respect rather than cultivating resentment towards them has helped me see this  Yay I got a full house    Wait  this isn't poker is it  I lose again   Great idea   There really are so many advantages to sobriety beyond the obvious ones   I will not drink with you today   some nice upgrades to my roadbike  and some really good meals  well done for those 9 days  you are doing great  Your are 100  correct regards loving yourself and this is definitely something I need to learn as I don't even like myself  Im going to read both of these books  Im so grateful for everyones help  I never expected even one reply so it really is so kind   Yep you're bang on  Let's do this together  Keep fighting the good fight    Sorry for your loss  You could try  "The Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions"  https   www amazon com Twelve Steps Traditions Alcoholics dp 0916856011  and  "Living Sober"  https   www amazon com Living Sober AA Services dp B0048C7TFA    they both helped me a lot and were written 15 and 30 years after the "Big Book" Alcoholics Anonymous   But the one book  that is not published by AA  which told me the most about AA and really helped me come to terms with practicing the 12 Steps as an Atheist is the book  "Not God"  https   www amazon com Not God Alcoholics Ernest Kurtz dp 0894860658  by Ernie Kurtz I'm not drinking today here in the U K      Classes begin again tomorrow and if I want to graduate   I have to not be a drunk fuck      Dont forget the over 37  years Fash and I got together with first hand daily experience  What does that mean  And we are lying cause it so cool to be Junkies these days  You know with friends dying weekly cause of fent and doctors being pressured to cut scrips  This idiots a Danger with this bad information he is mouthing off on  Hes watched Trainspotting and tried to shoot pharms a bit and hes the expert  Yet in the other sub a dozen users told him he was wrong  But hes not gonna let the facts get in the way of an arguement  Then theres the deleting of replies cause I called him on one them  It upset him enough to PM me last time so I wont bring it up again  And you watch S he will stick his nose in this thread even though he is not welcome  You are about the tenth person whos come forward to complain about him  Yet Fash and I are the problem  Fuck Him  And see Im not exposing him  Yet he calls me out earlier  Coward  Hello   I knew from growing up I had a predisposition towards addiction if I wanted one  I was 26 before I started drinking regularly  I already had an established life  hobbies  circle of friends who I knew and didn't care if I drank or not   A lot of people I've met on my journey have drank since their childhood and all events in their life have revolved around it to the point where there are no friends who don't excessively drink  No hobbies that don't revolve around sitting at a bar  I've even heard people say "I don't know who I am without alcohol "  I've also heard several times that people will judge you on your consumption based on their judgements of themselves  If you're abstaining then they might feel guilty  But that's them  not you  There are events I've decided not to attend because I didn't want some acquaintances to feel like they had to alter their behaviors around me  It's probably not a situation I need to place myself in anyways   Last point would be euphoric recall  If you are to see your drug of choice you might be tempted based on the possible rewiring of your brain  Not everyone has this of course  but it is something to be aware of  In testing they placed triggers in front of various people and addicts brains lit up when their drug of choice was shown   I definitely relate that I do not want to be ruled by this and give up everything I enjoyed in the past   things I enjoyed before I fell deep into my addiction  That said  I'd be very careful with where and whom you place your time with until you have a strong handle on what made you want to stop in the first place  Sign me up please        I love this last paragraph  Well said  Oddly enough  Kava Kava tea has proven effective for anxiety for some people  It has a GABA producing alkaloid in it that can provide fast anxiety relief  If you are taking any benzodiazepine based anxiety meds  like Xanax  Klonipin  etc  I would read into the effects of ingesting Kava in tandem with those before taking any   The leaves community will always have your back as well   There's a program you can download called Cold Turkey  You schedule in your study time and you are unable to access social media sites during those times  im in  please add me to the list Not going to drink today  But I will think about all of the stuff that deciding to drink has cost me over the years   I'm gonna stand over there and watch you tear assholes  A rare Smokey day indeed  Honestly  once you realise you don't need cigarettes any more and you're free of them  that was an incredible feeling  I'm so glad you've escaped them too  Don't rush to drop the nicotine levels in your juice  Take it easy and you'll get there  trust me  Now I treat my vaporiser like a glass of fine wine  I usually use it for a short while in the evenings when I'm unwinding  I don't bring it out with me  At one point I was worried I was more addicted to vaping because I would bring it everywhere  but you generally go through that stage when you drop the nicotine and you vape more in reaction  It does level out in time  Now that I know there's no nicotine in my juice I'm just not that fussed about it any more  It's just a treat for myself at the end of a long day   Day 2 for me as well  Woke up with a huge hangover yesterday after going out on NYE  I have to do better this year  The stakes are much higher in 2017  Child on the way  new job  new house   Well  good luck and see you again in about six months   How do you climb a staircase  one step at a time  Love this  It applies to so many things other than drinking  Thanks for posting  It happens to everyone  When I drank after a few months off  nothing terrible happened  but like you  I also woke up with a cloudy the next day and realized how much I missed the feeling of waking up with clarity and energy  I also noticed when my friends were throwing away half finished drinks  which was a huge  bright  glowing red flag reminder to myself that I have a problem with alcohol    I'm glad you realized that drinking isn't for you  and that nothing terrible or embarrassing happened  I'll gladly not drink with you today  Many people report quitting greatly improves mental health and makes you more able to deal with hardships  Good luck and stay strong  Focus on getting off the alcohol  After that is under control  you can re evaluate the other substances issues in your life   I will not drink with you today     I still feel really groggy some days       Still better than being super hungover   There isn't one close to me honestly  Where are you from  In the U K  It doesn't seem very popular therefore not very wide spread    I'm just gonna see how I go this week  Hopefully it's mostly mental  I need to get my anxiety disorder in check too as that's what makes me want to drink so I can just let go and chill   I will not drink today  no matter what happens  Thanks for the idea  Here here  I'm desperate to go to the pub today after having a shit time with my ex girlfriend  who  no suprises I lost due to drinking   But i'm hanging in there  just going for a walk instead   Day 2  I also find a shotgun clears my sinuses right up  Hobbies  Picked crocheting back up  Made a couple of nice throws and covers  Does tea drinking count  Books  Tons of books  both paper and audio  Amazing what a better attention span does for the enjoyment of them     Bought  Really small things in general  The biggest advantage is that when unexpected expenses arise   it isn't as devastating   Glad to hear things are going well      There are a few ways to track your progress  An excell spreadsheet is a good way too tally on what days you slip up then this can give you averages per month for you to work on  The badge counter is a bit primative but each to their own   Great  I will join your January 2 "party" and not drink with you and your daughter today  good on you  the good news is that associations like that fade relatively quickly  id be very surprised if they survive a 30 day streak I will not drink today   Lots to get done before back to work tomorrow   Oh  this is really useful  I'll check them out  thanks  after you get done with the "safe withdrawal"   which we all hope you do   Staying sober   is  going to be 100   mental  Thanks   I'm thinking I'll be there later this spring so I'll have to check some out    You never do  I originally quit because it was making me anxious   and I was using it to hide from my problems thinking "I'll just go back to it when I find nicer smoking buddies " It's been nearly a year and a half    Gotta get over the taste though   I will not drink today   When I was 8 but didn't start looking at Internet porn until like 16 or 17  When I was 26  that was 4 years ago  I decided to do something about the habit but took me another two years so 28 until I started to see porn and masterbation as two different things  These forums have come along way since I first started seeking out information  like 6 years ago you wouldn't have found information on these problems like there is today  Be on antidepressants whilst sober   Being on them whilst unsober doesn't target any potential self medicating   I will not drink today   Maybe I'm alone here  but I still smoke pot  I don't smoke everyday or even all day  Normally just a puff or two at night  My anxiety is off the charts and I don't take perception meds  Drinking was my problem  I would never  ever go to work stoned  but I've gone to work drunk so many times   You're not unique  I've seen GAD disappear in many  many lives after a brain gut normalizes  Seems to take between 1 3yrs  Jeej checking in  Happy new year everybody  For myself it has worked out pretty well  My close friends just accept I don't drink anymore and the ones who still drink like a pirate every second they get I just don't have out with  Nothing makes you feel like you made the right choice like being sober around a bunch of drunks  Even at family gatherings after you see someone on your third drink you start to think to yourself "oh wow  this is what I was like the whole time " I support my friends who no longer drink and I find other things to do with the ones that still do  Meet your friends who still booze for lunch or day time activities and then plan other fun things with the ones who don't drink  I don't judge or get involved  Everyone is on their own path  Work on making yours more positive and everything will level out accordingly Do you want to quit drinking  We can help with that  but only if that's what you want  not a fan tbh  the problem with a "keeping score" model like this is that it doesnt really track progress either  it just remembers stuff  also  once the numbers get somewhat high  it starts moving at a snails pace  with a shit ton of work required to even marginally improve the average or such figures    not saying the badges are perfect  but  i like them  if you can learn to not catastrophise a reset  they can be a great tool   That might have been a better option I am again inspired today by something someone's posted  Keep it coming y'all  I've been trying to write my relapse story to post later but every time I try to edit it  it gets longer    Oh my goodness  thank you  I won't  We'll keep fighting the good fight together   Yes  thankfully I always keep tea at work   I normally drink it more than coffee   but I just can't seem to wake up this morning   Something about how "I'm not even supposed to be here today "  haha Yay the holidays are over  Not drinking today  Congratulations  Well done and thanks for the inspiration  Happy New Year of freedom  Almost 39 days   I know that feeling of not caring  I suffered from it when I was 100  NEET   Try reading this  https   www reddit com r StopGaming comments 5kt3pt why games are bad for you what i learned from the    It might explain why you don't care anymore  Then just try a 90 day no gaming and no porn detox  Why no porn  A lot of the time we addicts switch from one destructive activity to another  Playing countless hours of video games and watching lots of porn look very similar   just you in you room staring at a screen and getting ridiculous amounts of stimulation from it   On a chemical level  your brain gets even more stimulation and pleasure from porn than gaming  https   www youtube com watch v 7oFVOJf0TzY   so don't switch from beer to vodka   I'm not saying you need to reinvent you life  start new hobbies activities  because that might seem scary and might stop your currently lazy brain from starting  Trust me I was there  Just detox  Just don't do those two things  Do whatever you want for those 90 days except those two things  stare at the sealing for all i care  maybe try avoiding drugs and large amounts of alcohol    but I'll leave that responsibility to you   Just make a pact with yourself not to do those two things  and no substitutes either   No Twitch YouTube Gaming channels  Instagram for half naked chicks   ecc   See for yourself if after a week or two of 'not doing' you'll get the desire to do something that is actually productive  But for the moment  just don't do those two things I did exactly this once  My god  worst decision I've ever made  For one day I was all 'I'm going to get control  find a better job  get where I want to be'   cue 6 months of unemployment on welfare  I'll never go back there again  Well done for getting out  I salute you   Thanks for sharing your story with me  You're right about the fact that it only gets worse  I think alcohol is so deceptive in that for some people there is never that car crash moment of realisation  Alcohol sneaks up on you so slowly that you can't recognise how much you've changed and are damaging yourself until it's too late     I'll bet that your drinking has a lot more to do with your mental health than you think it does   I think I've been coming to this conclusion today and for a while now  I've been convinced that depression is the sole reason for my despondence  and that it's something I only need to live with and survive through  But actually  I think my alcohol has a huge part in my depression  You'e right about not being honest with my therapist  I haven't come clean to them about how much I drink or the frequency of it   I think I'm going to try and do this alone for now  I have a huge support group of friends and family  my mum just called me as I've told her about all this and how helpful you've all been  and she's all for keeping tabs on me and is amazing at advice  Fortunately she's a mental health manager so she's very knowledgable about all of this   Again  thank you for sharing this with me and for giving me a little bit more confidence in myself    Honestly  reading all of these comments has made me feel just a little more confident about a future without booze    Thank you so much  Your approach and mindset are so refreshing and free of shame  It's an amazing perspective  one I am insanely jealous of  You just gave me my second big goal of 2017  Thanks for sharing  Ahh to dart between discussing German foreign policy and ladies knickers  Only on CA  Goodness  I needed this  Thanks for sharing  Not drinking with you today  I will not drink today  Woohoooooo  The Onion says it's the land of 10 000 retards  Just keep it up  Best iv felt in a long time     That I have no idea what to do with my life    Ruined my best friend ship I have ever had and   probably will never get that back  we were friends for 16 years  fuck love triangles of confusion    zero social life since   last event  hermit life has taken hold  weed makes this life tolerable   Have been smoking for 8  years  last year took a few weeks off here and there  this year it's done son  have basically hit rock bottom in my mind  which is good cause I actually feel like I can do it  the other times their was always a part of me that didn't want to quit  now theirs no part of me that wants to smoke    I would like that  thank you  I am going to stay on here  between reading The naked Mind someone kindly pointed me to a free download   My brother is a great guy but has never struggling with the issues I have  drinking especially is not something he has ever bothered about  so I know it will be hard for him to understand how its not just a case of "stopping"  And I like him to think Im strong and coping with life  Even though I am not at all  If you struggle to quit cold turkey  I'd say buy a vaporizer  5g a day is outrageous using any method other than joints   A long time ago   before I knew about reddit    I used to manage some streaks like 30 or 60 days and then relapse   I never felt I was making the change I wanted  the reason    my lifestyle  if you are reaching streaks of 30 days without a new way of life   your streak will mean nothing    you will binge again    in my case meditation has been part of my daily life   thats the main reason of my streak    I had like a 10 year porn addiction  in 2013 I got the right info to make a change   but it was until october 2013 that I could start my current streak  before 2013 I tried and failed many times   I don't count that time because my lifestyle didn't provide a solid foundation to make recovery a reality    so  in my opinion it depends on what you are doing for your recovery Day 2  feeling positive and supported by this sub  I will not drink with you all today  I know  this model just helps us remind the days we succeeded  Luckily you are only 24 and have plenty of time to turn your life around  If that is what you want  Not today  Not today  Not today   Agreed   OP   THIS is officially what alcoholism looks like   I love my nomo counter     It was definitely a huge driver in my sobriety  The thought of resetting my badge here and resetting my nomo counter always gives me intense anxiety and that extra incentive to put that drink down  And all the money    all the money  Instead of that massive oversized 90 dollar bottle of bullet  I can instead but three pairs of 30 dollar pants   Well  that is totally different  but since majority of people here keep score  then why forget the winning factor  I quit twice   the first time I mega dosed Imodium and the second time I only took three or four tablets every other day  sometimes every third day  That worked a lot better  and I was able to taper down with no problems  I mainly took it to stop the vomiting and shaking  I'd say you can take a lot less than you think you need  Even if it did extend my withdrawal  it was necessary for me at the time  I prob took it for a 2 week period or maybe 1 5  Don't let it overwhelm you  You are still young and in time this will pass and just be a bad memory  Hire a lawyer and try to get the best deal you can  then buckle down work and get through your punishment  hopefully probation and community service  then get on with your life and use this lesson to help you to never drink and drive again  I got lucky when I was a few years older than you and ran my truck off the road and through a fence when I was just a year or two off probation for a DWI  I drove drunk the whole time I was on probation and just got "lucky"  Twice I got pulled over and the police let me go  I could have easily died in that accident  A 2x4 was sticking through the windshield into the passenger seat of my truck  If someone had been riding with me they would have died  Had I gotten another DWI before this it would have motivated me to stop this dangerous behavior prior to this accident  Luckily  nobody died and I got off with a public intoxication ticket as they could not prove I was driving the truck because I took off walking after the accident and only remember waking up while walking down a dirt road  While there have been a few occasions  I pretty much quit driving while drunk after this    I am just trying to put your situation into the best light for you  If you take it as an opportunity to learn a lesson and adjust your behavior  it could have been the best thing to happen to you  If you were driving that fast at a 1 8 you could easily have killed yourself  everyone in your car  and other innocent people on the road as well as causing some PTSD to the first responders    If you need to stop drinking completely to stop this behavior  then please do so  I am sure this sub can give you lots of advice and resources for getting help if needed  I am not one to tell you how to do that  just wanted to let you know that you are not alone and your life is not over  Did you not look at porn between the ages of 8 and 16 or were you implying that you were looking at other forms of pornographic media other than what was available on the internet  Something something alone and wanting more  While having moar   Praying I wont drink today  Good luck everyone  What a great day to start your freedom from the grips of alcohol  I won't drink with you today   Well back to day 1  I'll go through periods of LOTS of picking and then periods when I'm not picking  Seemingly not by any willpower of my own  I'm just    not thinking about it  But then if I start thinking about how I'm doing so well with not picking  I'll find myself picking again because I've brought it back to my attention  It's hard to put a number on the days because  when I'm doing well  I'm not counting the days    One of my resolutions for the new year is mood regulation all around  that seems to help my picking the most  It was nice to quit drinking when I did because this year the holidays didn't put me in too bad of a hole  I feel like I spent my booze money on gifts  which is a great feeling  I also felt like I could buy myself things I needed like new skates and new snow boots   As far as hobbies  I've taken up crochet since I stopped drinking and it's been really great  It gives me something other than sipping on a drink to do when just hanging out with friends or watching tv  I can't drink and crochet at the same time  I just gave a friend the scarf I made for him for Christmas and he was so excited about it  Such a good feeling  TMI   I will not drink today  All of us alcoholics have done things we are not proud of   You can't change what happened   You can only make changes going forward    Do you have a plan   Rehab  Therapy  AA   Also  might I suggest you post on  r stopdrinking    It is a much more active sub   I will not drink today I can see how that would help  My whole life I have struggled with one addiction after the other  and always believed it to be part of my personality  Managed to quit drugs cocaine ecstasy  and cigarettes when i had my first child but replaced with the more acceptable drug alcohol and this is the hardest fight yet  Appreciate the reply and best wishes to you too  My day 2 too  Stick with it and stay connected to this sub  We can do this   I don't consider that a relapse  A relapse is when you fall back into old habits and erase whatever progress you made  You made a mistake and learned from it  Good for you for quitting ciggies too  That truly is a disgusting habit with no benefits whatsoever  Keep on truckin u brookeslegit   NO  The earlier the better  Porn has no benefits so why not quit  I will not drink today  This 2017 wagon is getting crowded   Lemme on  Day 17 cold turkey off of 40 to 60 g day  Sleep very fitfully  wake up with waves of anxiety  I've had this Christmas break off and I'm going back to work tomorrow  and I'm completely terrified  Sweating like crazy at night  wake up every hour little less  have a zero motivation  I'm really worried about work  I have so many things that I've left unfinished  that demand my immediate attention when I get back tomorrow  Really   After all my drivel and bullshit  THAT'S where CA draws the line    I have to poop too  Do you have the kids today  If not  why not try making some tea and hanging out on the couch with this sub for a couple hours  When I couldn't do anything else  I read people's stories here and it sparked some motivation for me  Hope to see you around     You have found a good place to go to  here  You'll be ok  Don't let your thoughts consume you  Your alive  I won't drink with you today   Yes  it is different for everyone   I just wanted to convey  that even if relapse  the progress we made doesn't gets lost  That time is still accounted for  we don't start from zero  we continue from there  And that is what I think this model will convey  Way to go  it's good to know that all the things I am missing right now  are possible by quitting  Thank you for sharing  Sorry but I don't fully understand what you meant  You mean that alcohol intake could be a reason for my GAD  I had similar thing earlier in 2016  ending a stint of abstinence with a single beer   that's all it takes  The important things    recognizing it's only a 'battle' lost  and you are able to make clear self observations to learn from as you move forward  Good luck  look  i dont think youre ready to be a cautionary tale just yet  i mean youre young  youre free  you have a fucking degree to work with  i mean  just go reset your badge and go tackle day 1   I think the best reminder or coping mechanism for that is how you felt the morning after the day you relapsesd   The guilt and the unravelling of all the progress you had made    Tell yourself that that one drink won't even feel good  perhaps not even taste good  because the moment it touches your lips you reset  You've gone way back to the beginning and you have to endure those awful first days all over again    Stop that one drink from happening and you don't have to suffer day 1   groundhog day   Good luck   I've got to start getting my shit together and put away my Xmas shit  clean out the fridge  wash the kitchen floor  etc  Then I have to get some actual paid work done because I am broke AF  I didn't sleep last night   but only had very minor WDs from drinking for ONE measly day  I have 8 benzos left but gotta save them in case I go off the wagon before the 15th  blessed script renewal day     grumble grumble  Great post  Thank you  Thank you alot  I already started going out more the past days  but another reason which is probably the reason why I wrote this post is that I lost the feeling of self worth  On top of all these problems I struggle with a girl which ultimately got me on an all time low    I will take your advice to heart  but I am currently really fucked up in my head because of all these mixed moods  I wonder if those of us who try so hard to be seen to be strong   the people who try to cope with too much   tend to be more likely to get a bit crushed by the weight of things and end up having issues with alcohol and other substances   But you ARE strong  you've reached out  you're raising kids on your own  you're working  you're doing a LOT to keep it together  and there's no shame in getting help for your sake and for the sake of your family   I do find that people are often far more understanding and forgiving than I expect them to be   coming clean to by business partner was nerve wracking  but I've had nothing but support and encouragement from him  even though he hasn't been through this kind of struggle and doesn't really understand the idea of not being able to 'just stop'    Either way  you're here  and so are we   We've got your back  so if you need to be sad  or angry  or frustrated  or confused or happy  or  if you want to be pointed in the direction of good resources  you have come to the right place  Makes sense to me brother  I'm scared to death to sleep most of the time  because I wake up  in inexplainable land     20grams a day   I'm not even sure how much that is  so I could of taken 6 x that a day    Does anyone know about how much fits into a "00" Capsule with the fine flour powder     No I haven't quit yet and haven't started a taper yet  I'm trying figure out Just how I'm going to do this exactly  If I do   I quit a couple times before   I'm still piecing together events that has happened in the past 2 years and also before that when I quit  I'm not jumping into Withdrawal without of plan  that's for sure   Been there and it was hell    i know its a sin to put ketchup on it but i like it A sobering reminder that today is not promised and that I will not pollute my body with toxins   Thanks for sharing   Control the things you can  get them into meetings for kids with alcoholic parents  therapy  and Amazon Prime books their way that are relevant   Continue to talk about it with them and your dad   One of the most difficult things for those with addicted loved ones to deal with is the silence or denial surrounding the existence of the addiction   Every time your father denies he has a problem  he is telling them their reality isn't what it really is   That causes serious emotional damage   If you talk about the addiction with them  you will continue to validate their daily reality  which will be so empowering to them   This validation is one of the reasons that Al Anon is such an amazing resource   I'm hoping you would have shared if they are in physical danger   Either way  that comes first   I wouldn't hesitate to call the police if you have any reason to believe he is driving under the influence  advise them to do the same   or please call the Department of Human Services if your siblings are directly in danger   The emotional well being of children is not to be taken lightly    Yeah  it's so fucking cool to be a junkie  That's some HS bullshit lol  no one would voluntarily brag about things like shitting on the floor because they're trying not to puke whilst running to the washroom  Why   It's not exactly fun or glamorous      And I agree  I think people SEE the whole lighter and spoon thing in movies and make assumptions    Hell  I certainly did way back in the day  I remember the first time I ever shot up and I was like "uhhh aren't you supposed to heat it up or something " but my friends were like    nope   In retrospect  they were stupid as fuck and even they knew better  ffs   Hey  Fuck you too  man  Hahaha  I feel you  So many average idiots who do nothing more but sleep  eat and shit  And moreover they are comfortable living the rest of their pathetic lives that way   First of all  you are depressed  Here is a book that helped me and will help you if you use it  "The Depression Cure" by Dr  Steve Ilardi   I have very same thoughts from time to time  But you know what  You and I can always choose to just stop get back to gaming and forget everything  Hell  I would love to go back to WoW and CSGO  But that's selling yourself short   I'm not "gifted" nor "talented" in some special way  But I believe that average Joe like you and I can achieve things beyond average  Skillpower over Willpower  That's what I tell myself  Doing small things but doing them consistently is a way to go    Media feeds us bullshit about "successful" and "genius" people  90  of that is absolute horseshit  And you have a right to be mad  There are people who seem to be having it all  But fuck them  Big "fuck you" to all of them and others  Because they are lying pieces of shit  Everyone struggles   I have only one life and you  I suppose  too  So why bother about someone else's expectations  Progress as much as you can and forget about everyone else  You are changing something and that's all that matters  When I was 13 I actually hit puberty and was looking at the odd magazine here and there  wasn't till I was 16 that we got a computer with Internet at home  mind you this was like 1999 or 2000 ish  about 16 24 I wouldn't say I had an excessive use problem it was as I got older o was using it to escape not just cause I was horny  Hey  if you like it   go for it  Thank you   Thank you  I will not drink today  I am so with you  girl  I'm moving in 11 days and my  1 goal   find some friends  I'm not sure if they will necessarily be "sober friends" but they will for sure be friends where our  1 connection isn't booze  All my current friends  with the exception of one running buddy and one work friend  are from bars  karaoke   so they are mostly Facebook friends at this juncture  Holding a grudge  Whatever  As long as this person isn't sitting alone with another person as a "counselor" then everything is OK   Had a great day 1 yesterday  Today will be as good if not better  Not gonna say I won't take it   P  Wait  I thought it was a pissing contest    grabs mop and bucket  Thanks Lem  I mean really with this shit though Wait a second an organ donor on an alcoholism subreddit    You may wanna rethink something there    Lol  I know what you mean  Most of the world is off today  Or so it seems    You are sooo close to turning a corner man  This whole process can grate at your resolve to quit  It seems unending at times  I promise you that you will be okay tomorrow  may not be how you want to feel   yet  but you can do it   Maybe getting involved back into work is what you need right now  The diversion and the "go" requirement may push you through  I know when I got to the point you are  just over it and praying it would end  it was 2 days away and boy was I thankful  on my knees thanking whoever   You are almost there brother  You have come so far  Please don't pysch yourself out  You have warriored through don't turn around now  You can get it done  Proud of you   Not exactly uncommon in my life in general  tbh     Right here with you   I never had much passion for anything  I would switch from game to game looking for a high and an escape  I am on day 7 right now and even in the first few days I have been experiencing so many emotions  Anger  fear  hope  excitement   The funny thing is that I prefer even the negative emotions to the emptiness that I have experienced for so long  At least I am feeling something  It gives me strength to resist the cravings  They ebb and flow like the tides but each day has been a little better  I am looking forward to day 14    30     90     180     360    I know what it's like to experience suicidal thoughts  Just random ideas that popped into my head  One of the scariest symptoms of addiction is the powerlessness that we have  If you can accept that  it's easier to understand that the urges and ideas we have are our brain playing tricks on us  I hope this helps somehow   I will not drink today Doing it right  I asked him if you heat a pill and it melts all the shit do you want to shoot that  Thats a  no  The drug is soluble and the binders not  So you are shooting polymers and fillers when you heat  And thats OK  Huh Really  Glad I can help  Think about it like this  If you have food poisoning  your body makes you feel bad  'gush from both ends'  and stay away from food for a while  We all have been poisoning our brains for a long period of time  and now we need to stay away for a while    Good luck  And alcoholics    What is a full house of dicks      No drinks today  Welcome   I was just talking with a friend of mine   I honestly stayed away from sobriety for a long time because  I thought I had to be physically dependent on alcohol to have a problem   I came to realize that I could simultaneously have a problem with alcohol and not be alcohol dependent   I've found great support in the rooms of AA where I found lots of people just like me   I've also found great insight here at SD    When I think about what you wrote  I remember that my story is pretty much similar  Of course I always had anxiety problems  but I started drinking when I was in good state   and from the very start I couldn't moderate  Maybe I was just born this way too  Thank you for your words  Ounces  Lol  Thank you for sharing this  Don't donate the liver   I don't know how it works  I used to smoke 14g a week  100  at 8 12 joints a day  Sober now but still cough up black shit daily   Would love to know how he can have a smoke in the morning and quit during the day   I could NEVER do that  i have to smoke before bed then quit in the morning  no way could i go through the day without smoking again if i smoked on a morning   I'm with you  too  Day 1 and done   You're 25 years old and talking like your life is over  and it's too late for you   Do you know how strange that sounds to a 51 year old like me     Think for a minute about yourself as a 51 year old man   Imagine yourself with almost 10000 days on your badge     Begin with the end in mind  https   www reddit com r pornfree comments 2wdkvj a concrete tip for staying away from porn begin    Its a Beautiful Morning here in Wisconsin  I will enjoy it by not drinking  Our marriage counselor said that with addiction  the longer you go  the less intense the urges are over time  but if you succumb to the urge  the intensity resets to very powerful  and neurocircuitry  wise  you're back to square one  and the urges are shot up to the same potent max they were before   This could explain lack of motivation  vs  The numbers restarting   It's a cool idea though  but I think the less cpnsequences you have mentally for yourself for a relapse  the more likely you are to relapse   That's how it was for me with alcohol  I will not drink today  no matter what  Reading of another member's post on pancreatitis reminded me to stay vigilant   Poppy seeds will also help   A tea with 1kg should help you feel better   People like to say poppy seed tea is dangerous but in your case I wouldn't worry about that   Worse case scenario you will get high  Reading these posts  made me think  that maybe it was that "old self" is who we tried to escape   Just a theory or a BIG LIE     I started to say other things but  I haven't quit like I said and don't want to mess with anyone's mind but my own right now     That's one thing I don't want to deal with is other people's minds out there  In the Real  not here   I don't know if that makes sense to anyone either  I will not drink with you all today  I will not drink today  I will not drink today  Good luck  And try to find an alternate activity that gets you away from the usual routine  I'm even just trying sit in a different part of the house so I'm not staring at my smoking spot  This is exactly what I have been doing kids happy having a chill day playing Sims so I don't feel too guilty for not giving them all my attention  They have accepted that I dont feel well  told them it was flu   Im going to read some success stories too like you suggested  I dont want this feeling of being motivated and ready for change to stop  Well done for your own success  that must feel great  All that says is some vape juice contains diacetyl  Nowhere does it say anyone has actually gotten popcorn lung from vaping or that vaping puts you at risk for popcorn lung    Again  there isn't a single documented case of vape related popcorn lung     Again  cigarettes contains 750x the amount of diacetyl than any vape juice  and yet there aren't even any documented cases of popcorn lung from smoking either    Again  finding a juice company that still uses diacetyl is super rare     You should try actually reading the articles you link because now  you  are supporting my argument  Thanks    http   www snopes com vaping causes popcorn lung    http   tobaccoanalysis blogspot com 2015 12 new study finds that average diacetyl html m 1        Not drinking today   Just for today   Not thinking about tomorrow    Sign me up  Day off today and then it's back to work tomorrow  I will not drink today   What a great post   Thank you for sharing      I wanna finish my stash off so I have none left Yeah once self driving cars are roaming the streets I won't have anymore excuses  You might add r petioles for those who are in the group of people r leaves does not cover  Clothes to replace the ones that no longer fit  because I was no longer taking in a bazillion bloaty calories of beer  And then clothes to replace those  Me too  Whew  Made it through the weekend  I will not drink today   Lol  I'm vaguely reminded of the time my roommate several years ago was hell bent on shooting Xanax     Is it possible  Yes  But it's not water soluble and the fillers will fuck your veins to all hell if you don't know what you're doing     Y'all want endocarditis  embolisms  etc  Because I'm pretty sure shooting a bunch of fillers and random shit is a great way to increase the likelihood   Happy almost 1 year sober friend  Exactly 3 weeks for that beautiful chip  Keep up the work Get back on the wagon   We are here to help and encourage you   One day at a time    D10  v2  all's well  I will not drink today  Worked out  cooking breakfasts for the week  still have tons to do before going back to work tomorrow  Vacation has been awesome  Don't give up   This sounds like a suicide letter to me   If so  just know that these feelings will pass  and that you can succeed with this battle   Your life means something  even if you can't see it right now   Please get help if you're suicidal   You are not a bad person  because of the addiction   Your brain is programmed to feel the way you're feeling right now  and you CAN change that   You CAN recover   You CAN be happy and have a normal life   You CAN do this  Or is it exciting to think how much more you'll have this year to spend on other stuff  Thank you for this Need it today    I learned how to be quieter  I was an insufferable know it all when I drank  and sometimes still now   I have been learning to be quiet  listen to others  seek advice  gasp    and generally offer advice when asked rather than ubiquitously  My millennial tendency to think of myself as 'a special snowflake with unique opinions that I need to share with the world' is hard to combat some days  but I am learning slowly   I dont get on with any member of my family  smoking weed let me ig ore all shit  now im sober we havent spoke for ages and i'm leaving them all for good   Sounds like a bright start to the new year  Love it  Thanks  It's hard as fuck to do  but in my experience  every time I binged on porn  I sooner or later binged on League  The reward circuits are  connected in the brain  so I think it's a huge trigger  I can't give up masturbation though  I need release once a week at least  so the hard part for me will be to masturbate without porn  The speech is called "This is water " It's fantastic  I will not drink today   Thank you for the words of encouragement  I really needed to hear some Yep  your just getting too personal  Good luck with your poop  Are expecting a solid one or more liquid   Count me in   not drinking with you today  I had a friend die as a direct result of shooting pills and that creep has the nerve to say to me no one ever died from shooting pills  WTF   And the Endo Fash had twice and me once was what  More lies so we look cool  Godamn enough   Edit  Sorry I didnt have Endo  I cant remember the name right now  But I had a bleed in my lungs from shooting drugs  Even without heating I still had enough in my rig to cause a hospital stay of five days with oxygen and a Big Time warning from doc that next time a bleed starts it might not stop  And I will bleed out in my lungs  Basically drowning in my own blood  Nice eh  Cant you see now why we lie about this  Fucking Dumb Ass   But this is cool eh S   Fuck  This is one of the reasons my ex bf broke up with me  I was am trying to improve my eating habits and try new things with the help of a psychologist  but he thought I wasn't progressing fast enough  Other people don't fully understand what it's like to have this fear constantly and that I have developed a habit that is hard to let go of  The 4 and 9AM trips had good consistency  A frat house Never once in 13 years did i get brain fog  not once  Not once got tired or lazy  i do t u derstand how people do  it got me Up and about  got me to sleep so i wasnt groggy in the morning  i used to smoke 14g a week 8 12 joints a day for 13 years everyday not once breaking that  Now i quit cant sleep or eat for over a month and i dont want to do shit all ever  Brain fog after smoking to me just shows your brain aint developed enough to smoke to begin with  Well done bro  feels good doesn't it  I may be coming out of my flatline already as I felt an energy surge on waking up  rather rollercoaster like  I may have been dreaming last night but can't remember what  I felt at one point like I was going to O but it never happened and I fell back asleep again  I have a bit of a cold at the moment which seems to make my urges return  Awesome stuff on your streak  70 days tomorrow  As a fellow tall thin man  duly noted  wishing you a quick recovery  Yes I quit adderall over a year ago and it definitely didn't help with the anxiety although it did with the crippling fatigue  I'm glad it helped  Here's to 2017 being poison free  Here's the tough lesson I learned when living my own personal hell of being in love with a wonderful  loving man who also had the disease of addiction  and depression   there was is NOTHING I could do to influence his sobriety or his drinking   I gave all  I loved  I supported  I paid for therapy  I went to therapy with him  I bought him art supplies to work through his demons  I meditated twice daily with him  I went on middle of the night runs with him when he needed to get energy out  we went vegetarian  we went to the gym  we went on hikes  we got a pet  we read and read and read about it all   The thing is  NOTHING I did or didn't do stopped him from drinking or encouraged him to drinking   That chaos existed apart from me  I just kept making the mistake of thinking that if I lived close enough within the chaos  I could control it   I was wrong   So let me start here  with love  it sounds like he is a very sick man  who has wonderful qualities or you wouldn't be with him   You said you were worried that he might drink himself to death if you left  but it sounds like he has already been trying to do that a few times  if not on a pretty regular basis   You also said you wanted to give him a second chance  but it sounds like that maybe was the 3rd or 4th or 5th chance      So be easy on yourself about doing for him and bring there for him because it sounds like you've been doing that   My question to you is  Is it working   I gave mine at least 100 chances   At least   I kept telling myself  my therapist  my friends that I wasn't ready to walk away until I felt like I had done everything I could do for him  for us   The truth is  I finally was ready to walk away when I finally admitted that all the things I was doing   it wasn't working   Sure  he had ups  sure he had months of sobriety   But sum total  all that bending over backwards  worrying  helping  frantic searches in the middle of the night   it wasn't working   Mostly because it wasn't up to me to do anything   Of course I don't mean be kind and caring and supportive   I mean it wasn't up to me to figure out how he could control his chaos and addiction   That was for him and him alone to fix   The hardest thing for me to swallow was that my love wasn't going to fix him   As an recovering addict  congratulations  that's hard work   you already know that   So here is the advice I would give myself 3 years ago if I could   1   Make a list about what I want in life  what's important  what goals I want to accomplish  what's not getting done that might regret  2   Double check that list to make sure it is really important  3   Ask myself what is standing in the way or preventing that from getting done  4   Make a plan to overcome or remove that obstacle   Only you will know when you are ready to move away from his entirety   meaning his good and his bad   It's not easy whether you stay or go   I hope you are going to AA and Al Anon meetings in the meantime   They will remind you of the importance of taking care of yourself and how important it is to work a program   And when you decide it is time to go  that means it is time  so please don't guilt yourself into staying  You have me in tears here  but in a good way  It means the world honestly  I have no real friends as Ive managed to isolate myself completely  other than work friends who dont know the real me just the fake me that I am through the day  You are right  a hobby is exactly what I need  Ive always put off anything that has me away from the house for too long  even resenting the kids after school clubs as it cuts in to drinking time  but I need to be out of the house  especially on the days they are not here  well done to you for your acheivments and thank you for taking the time to reply to me   Look  if mice are given cocaine every time they press a button  they're going to press that button over and over repetitively  because it makes them feel really good   It's super normal to want to feel really good as frequent as possible   That is normal across all animals  including us   But take the mice off the cocaine and they recover   It just takes time   Us addicts have trained ourselves to become impatient to gratification  and that's normal for addicts  but if you can just buckle down and get some cognitive behavioral therapy and develope positive coping skills to get through the depression  anxiety  and cravings  I give you my word  it works if you stick with it   It is not easy  but it is not impossible or even very difficult if your mind is in the right spot and set on your goals   Keep your focus on ypur goals  and that will help you to push through it   But developing coping skills is necessary  and cognitive behavioral therapy helps you do that   YOU ARE  NOT  A FAILURE  YOU ARE  NOT  A BAD PERSON  THESE ARE LIES THE ADDICTION IS TELLING YOU  YOU HAVE NOT FAILED  I'm so sorry for all of the pain you're experiencing  It really can get better  I have had similar feelings of despair  I feel like I have lost am losing everything  and I am so afraid to lose everything  that I want to just make it stop  effectively ensuring that I lose everything   Drinking is the easiest way  oblivion   Then it makes  me feel worthless and increases my self loathing  It's just bad feelings begetting bad feelings begetting bad feelings  It reminds me of the Bright Eyes song  "Hit the Switch"    I'm thinking of quitting drinking again  I know I've said that a couple of times  And I'm always changing my mind  I guess I am  But there's this burn in my stomach  and there's this pain in my side  And when I kneel at the toilet and the morning's clean light pours in through the window  sometimes I pray I don't die  I'm a goddamn hypocrite    After 86 days without drinking and some therapy I can report that I am still depressed and have psychological emotional problems and messed up thinking  but  I feel WAY better  Part of it is just removing the depressant and no longer feeling the pain and discomfort that drinking heavily bring  If you feel really bad physically it's harder to keep it together mentally  Part of it is the sense of accomplishment  And then a big part of it  for me  is removing  well  reducing  the total obsession with drinking  I can actually do things and pay a little bit of attention without obsessing over when I'm going to drink again    Good luck  You're not a bad person  You are addicted to an addictive substance  It's hard to escape from alcohol  but you can do it and it'll be worth it  I am signing up  The exams start in February  so with all the studying and other recovery stuff that I do  no gaming should be easy  Thank you    how long did you have them for   It took me years to curb my addiction  this is my longest streak by far  once got 50 days last summer but nothing else close to this  Don't give up  one day you'll find a way how to control it  Good Luck  I'm not drinking for the next 24 hours  So  at least until 7 53 a m  on Tuesday  January 3  2017  Everyones brain reacts differently to different chemicals  You may be right though  I am 18 years old and started smoking daily around 12  I should probably note that the only brain fog i got was the morning after or hours after burning out  Picking up my 2 year chip tonight  probably best not to show up drunk  I won't drink today  Don't be too harsh on yourself bro  There's still much time left  Start today  its never too late  Become porn free  Now is the time  At the end of 2017  you will have gained a 1 year streak  You can still achieve anything you want  Be dedicated and focused on your goal  Yay not today bro  30 days tomorrow  I will not drink today  The first time I took an extended break  wasn't planning to quit  I did the math and realized my shitty job in no way would support my family  girlfriend was pregnant at the time   So I got my shit together and increased my income by roughly 100   Went back to smoking once I was comfortable in my new job and being a dad    This time around my life is in better shape  Since I stopped about 5 months ago  I've come to one major realization     There is absolutely JACK SHIT that I'm better at when I'm high  The only reason this illusion was created was that I was smoking so much that it was normal for me  So in the short term  I would be "better" at certain things if I had smoked recently  Once I stopped for over a week this illusion was shattered   I'm on day 8 and read your post and was like  that's me  I've been sleeping ridiculous amounts of time and I'm still exhausted  Feel lethargic  grumpy and miserable  Maybe it's our bodies getting back on an even keel  Good luck to you  I won't drink with you today   That's a good resolution  Mine is to do more productive things when I'm home alone  I noticed a couple weeks ago when I was wrapping gifts and making cards for my family and stuff that I didn't think about picking even once  I was occupied doing something that brought me joy when a lot of times  I'll do things that are nonproductive  like binge watching Netflix  and I end up just bored and anxious and inevitably wander into the bathroom to pick  The first handful of meetings I went to I was a mute   I was basically a houseplant   I didn't utter a single word   AND THAT IS OK   However  when I finally decided to open up and speak a little  I found that it made my nervousness disappear   Everyone in that room has is going through the same thing you are   They are there to help  not judge   Give it a chance    All good so far   Best of luck to all  I recommend you get the "Adult Blocker" chrome extension and make a habit of asking yourself why you visit any particular website  youtube video  or tv channel  Good luck    u greatmainewoods  https   www reddit com user greatmainewoods  on   r stopdrinking  https   www reddit com r stopdrinking    In reply to  Now I am relegated to a dull lifestyle    I have to disagree with you  I think you will find  like me  that life without alcohol is far more rewarding and exciting than life with alcohol  Alcohol makes things boring  when you are not drinking   It's not that those things are necessarily boring  Alcohol fucks with the reward center of your brain  It takes a while for you to get to the state where just doing things like hiking  cooking  a sunny day  board games  movies become as rewarding as alcohol  You may find that it's more rewarding to live life without alcohol  I did     Wow  Another comment to make me count my blessings  You give powerful advice of acceptance  which is definitely not something I have been practicing  In fact  I regularly engage in thinking that somehow acquits myself of personal responsibility for my situation as a way to avoid accepting it  This was a powerful comment  Congrats   Thanks for sharing your story with us  I'm starting this new year with enthusiasm and positivism  knowing that if I'm sober I can be focused on everything that's valuable for me and my family  So I won't drink with you today  where everything starts   I will not drink today    This is exciting  I never have been part of this before  Makes me smile and I needed that   Good luck to all   All good so far   Get the "Adult Blocker" chrome extension and make a habit of always question yourself why you are doing whatever you are doing  It sounds like you handled the situation well  Don't beat yourself up  When you  actually  only have one drink  that's not going to kill you  The issue is when one drink leads to 10 drinks   So you're good to forgive yourself and move on to the next day of 100  sobriety     Thanks for the support   The same happened to me on Christmas  must have been some kind of stomach bug  I know exactly what you mean about how it feels good that it wasn't due to booze  It sucks that your boyfriend asked you repeatedly  If it was someone close to me asking me again and again after I already told them I didn't drink  I would get furious at them  For me weekends were are hard because of all that "empty" time that is so easy to fill with drinking  In my moments of strength  or regret etc  I would brain storm a hobby or something to go out and do    Make a dinner our of all purple food means I have to shop and cook  Go to the mall with my best friend and see who can model the worst outfit  Find a fan website for my favorite book and post crazy theories  I dared myself to do one thing like this sober and then another and again until I didn't have any more empty space in my weekends   Man the first week was ok  sleep was fucked and no appetite  week 2 rage on the whole meaning of life set in  that stayed till 1 month mark  Get ready and be prepared  buy a punch bag  that shit is godly  "Move a muscle  change a thought " I have analyzed  ruminated  dug deep for the big W  Why  Why   and none of that helped me at all  What did and does was folding laundry  mending something  cleaning the drain  shoveling  The sentence you've quoted above is the most helpful thing I've ever heard  Thank you   I have ocd and pubic pulling trich but I find that I do this too yeah  i don't do that anymore   No problem     Walk tall friend  you ARE doing what so many of us were are so afraid of  THAT takes a huge pair and a total overwhelming desire to kick this plant  It's no small feet  Keep rocking it  Lol what he said that  Uhhh okay    And yeah  the last time I had an IV and they had to go for the femoral after blowing over a dozen spots was really fucking fun and not awkward at all  The pictures of the PICC line they had to give me one time because my veins are so fucked off    nah  I made that up  All photoshopped lies      Nevermind that more than one person from this sub has physically seen me in hospital    Ahaha   I posted in this sub on my third day of sobriety  I received several messages congratulating on my decision and many words of support and encouragement  Little did I know that those words would reverberate in my mind each time that I found myself in a moment of weakness  just knowing that there was a group of people out there fighting the same fight that I'm fighting today made all the difference    This was my best New Years to date and I have myself  my loving wife  and these kind strangers to thank for it  Happy to have you here  I will choose Life with you today   Still comfortably in bed  6am here on west coast  Insomnia I think from getting on subs still  Today third day on em  Havent even been able to do more than one day since moving back to city couple months ago  Still gotta taper from xanax  continue to smoke etc  someday i may return to program  For now tho  the big thing is    Anyone relate   40 70 a day when I make  100 130 is just too much  I am 25 and want to travel more  india this summer  and am getting no where w this habit  Lotsa days I just dont care though  just about working towards that moment of catharsis the needle provides and that erodes desire worry about the whole other section of life  Why have all these complex cares when getting through my day to just nod smoke and watch tv can satisfy  Hard often for me to answer that  to remember why when i first wanted to be a punk i dreamed of something other than work sedation repeat yet somehow  in a different form  here we are  Regardless  enough about me  grateful to have taken my sub this morning and save my wallet n veins just for today  Like a couple of weeks  I think all that unprocessed anxiety just needed to come out somewhere tbh   Thank you for the kind words    I'm definitely the type who will go from 1 drink to 10 drinks without realizing it  I'm young so I've been able to justify my behavior  but I'm also old enough now to realize it's abuse and not just being a "weekend warrior"   Oh snap   Projecting their own insecurities all the time  Literally introducing me to new people saying "Here's  u IrishOrganic  he doesn't drink"      smh Well first off  alcohol doesn't really cook off  Here's a link   http   www todayifoundout com index php 2011 11 alcohol doesnt really cook out of food in most cases   For the last 2 years I have dithered whether or not to eat anything cooked with alcohol  My current thinking FOR ME is it is OK if part of gourmet cooking  Notion is that it is part of the flavouring and not alcohol for drinking  This is a fiddly point that I am not happy with  And is just for me  Mileage may vary   edit  I should add that this is my current thinking  For near 2 years I banned intake of alcohol in any form into my body  This relaxation is because I love gourmet food  I hope I haven't chipped a hole in my armor  I intend to proceed VERY cautiously  I spent 150 bucks on LivePlan and actually wrote my business plan    I finished it yesterday  I will not drink today   I will not drink today  It snowed like hell in STC last night  I wasnt about to trek out  even to the corner bar    Hope you made it back alright and didnt passout in a snowbank and get frostbite haha   "You"  your consciousness  are separate from your brain  When you go into life autopilot and let your brain take you to do what it wants  it will make you roll up some weed and smoke it  because it is addicted to the routine  "You" know why you have to stop  and "You" are the one in control of your brain  Force willpower over your actions and stop letting your addicted zombie brain smoke weed  It's a tough internal battle against your very being  but it is possible because you are the ultimate boss  Fuck that noise  Yes  but I still do "monkmode"   I hope you really like the job  Oh Fuck ya  Reg doc visits are a peach  From how easy it is to find veins to draw blood  To the look of disgust  when they see the marks  Not to mention the sudden shift in care and policy  Pain meds for a broken hip fuck him hes a Junkie  Give him 500 mg Ibuprofen stat  I would laugh it it wasnt true and so fucking sad and wrong  Not today   It could be a regional area thing  Or maybe just a thing they do at his homegroup  Or just a thing he does  I've been to enough meetings in almost 5 years in NJ and I've never heard that      Ya  I should have clarified that while I don't feel dependent on alcohol  I do feel it is still a massive glaring problem in my life       My last bout involved getting off the commuter train several times on the way home to relieve my nausea  aka throwing up behind posts and hoping station attendants weren't watching  Not exactly the most  social behaviour       The worst however is being a lethargic sloth around the house all the next day  not getting anything done  As someone who's very driven to achieve my goals in life  this is beyond frustrating    Yeah I think I'm gonna talk to her  it can only help  I know at the end of the day though I have to be strong enough to do it  I have definitely been short on self care as I've been caring for others  I've learned that I do best with one small change and  if it is an action  that it is best done upon awakening  My January plan for self care is taking the first 30 minutes each day to do something for me  Right now  that's 30 minutes of yoga  If yoga ceases to be fulfilling  I'll switch to something else  No matter what  the first 30 minutes of my day will be for me so that I can continue to care for others for the remainder of the day   I will not drink today   Go to bottom of the page and turn "Restricted mode   On" I'm glad you all made it through  I just reread the slogan   the way I was pronouncing it is   Less Fiends in Twenty 17    I like   Less Fiends in '17   or maybe   No Fiends in '17   Congratulations on 100 days  I will not drink today  I'm reading a book called Mean Mothers and the beginning part is all about this great fallacy that our culture clings to that mothers are somehow  because they gave birth to us  loving  wonderful  and caring creatures   It's this kind of belief that has you and had me continually mistreated by our mothers  yet reliably going back for more and feeling uncertain about cutting ties with her   I cut my mom out of my life for a year about 10 years ago and I have not regretted it one time   After a lot of toxic and sabotaging behavior directed at me  I told her that I thought it would be best if we stopped communicating for awhile and that I would reach out to her when I was ready to speak again   About a year later she offered  through email  to do therapy with me  so that we could work on the relationship   At the end of about 8 sessions  the therapist told me our work was done and my mom and her needed to spend time individually working   To this day I have a relationship with her that more closely resembles an acquaintance   Again  this is something I feel great about   If you haven't read the book Boundaries  do so   It will help you figure out how to set boundaries with your mom and everyone else   Don't let anyone make you feel guilty or bad about your boundaries   If your boundary is that she can't be a part of things if she drinks  then you can know that if she missed your wedding  that wasn't something awful you did to her  as she might claim   but rather a choice she made   Set the boundary with her and let others know so that you can feel supported and she can't twist it   That will at least set the stage for her to own her actions  though it doesn't mean she will   If you simply back away and don't tell her  she might not get the message  she might get the message and blame you for neglecting her  and or you lose out on the opportunity to teach others how to treat you   That doesn't mean she won't try to retaliate  but unless you are worried about your physical safety  I say be very clear with her about your boundaries involving her   I'm sorry your mom is doing this  I was in a minor accident  not my fault   However police came and I was in the back of the patrol car filling out insurance info  answering questions   So glad I wasn't fucking drunk  as it was a time of my life that that could have easily been the case  and the accident could have been far worse  even a fatality    Good that you quit   just one of the many freedoms of sobriety  taking your life back feels so good   Don't worry  your balls will not explode  I can tell by personal experience as i am 6 days into NoFap  It will go away with time  your body will adjust accordingly  Great advice   It is worth it  I'm into nightly ice cream  but that's ok despite the fat around my belly  still smoking  but finally can see quitting in my future  In the beginning  my sponsor told me not to make any major decisions the first year  Stopping drinking and staying stopped one day at a time was and remains my priority over everything else  Whatever happens  I won't drink today  So many people are resistant to the religious dogma in AA  yet many continue go because there is something there that works for them  community  etc    My own personal approach when I went to AA was a combination of "fake it til you make it" and "take what you need and leave the rest "  That is  staying alcohol free was more important to me than the specifics of the program    But why would you want to do a thing like that  Yeh no more artificial nuts  all my nuts are going to be free range organic   But what about corn   I got a massive headache that lasted through days 6   7   Woke up today feeling pretty darn good  however   You never know what your body is doing to purge all the accumulated poison  and what nutrients and micronutrients have been depleted in order to accomplish that  I've been trying to eat as healthfully as I can  and added some green tea into the mix  I'm also taking some vitamins  For sure not a doctor though   Stand strong  fellow day eight er  We can do it  Welcome  When you can  check out the links on the sidebar  I will not drink with you today  Yeah I'm nearing 30 and am in a similar stage  I live in a big city where many people stay single into their mid 30s and maintain an early 20s lifestyle all the while  I recently attended an acquaintance's 33rd birthday party that included beer pong and people clogging the toilets with vomit by the end of the night  Of course not everyone continues on this way  but it's very easy to surround yourself with similar level partiers and never feel like it's a problem      I got a ride home   well I ride to an after party anyway but it was across the street from my house so the stumble home in the morning wasn't too bad   Of course I couldn't find my shoes so I wore my friends boyfriends slippers home   Still need to return those   Lol I'm also quitting after 8 9 years  Really tough  I've been going over two months  and am at 4gms a day now  from 40 60 day  Had to switch strains 5 days ago and staying at the same dose has jumped me back into more intense withdrawals  Holidays jacked up my taper too  It really is scary to see how few people are quitting from 5  years  though if you loook you see some long term users that have successfully quit with long tapers  I'm trying BSO next week to go cold turkey from  hopefully  2 5 grams  A week after that I'm at Disneyland for a week and hoping that'll distract me enough to push me through week 2   Weight of a teaspoon varies a lot due to things like grind and moisture content  I'd guess 1 2 grams a teaspoon  Maybe I'm way off though  I will not drink today  I will not drink today  I'm just angry about WD's  Well I'm not really withdrawing anymore  because I was able to down some soup and my bac is now probably too high to call this a taper anymore  I'm listening to the audiobook of the girl on the train  And I like it because there's finally some good descriptions of being an alcoholic and blackouts    But it also annoys me that the woman is able to not drink for a few evenings while my kindling is getting worse and worse    And can somebody just explain to me why it's legal to sell something you can die from when you suddenly stop consuming it after you did for a long time  Why doesn't a bottle have the same warnings cigarettes do    Going to stop whining now  Happy New Year Fap  Well  I drank more yesterday as well  I don't know why  But that whiskey is going down the drain this morning due to being "I never want to drink again" hungover this morning  Yeah  numbers don't lie      Big props for taking an inventory  It is a hugely useful piece of the process  I did this  too  first in 2013 and then compared to 2014 month to month when I really started my alcohol reduction  It became a healthy challenge  seeing how much I could reduce spend  Most months  I was 50 60  less than previous year  Kept a VERY simple journal to track  What I also liked was way less bottles clanging around in the house  going out to the garbage    I hate that sound  lol  Good luck   I've started back numerous times after a quit with the intention of only taking it a couple times per week  Every time has resulted in every day use within a matter of a few weeks  I'd highly recommend not taking it again  I won't drink today  I got too much life to live   This year I hope to   1  graduate 2  go to Cuba 3  win a fitness contest 4  meet  real  friends  One 00 is 1 2 grams depending on how tightly you stuff it  in my experience  To think I was shoving 40  capsules a day down my throat a few months ago is kind of disgusting  Having to hide capsules at work  sneak them through states where Kratom is scheduled  etc    SO ready to be done  Yeah    I love when they ask "where did all these bruises come from " all accusatory    Um  from y'all  I don't typically miss  ffs   To the drain it goes  Do I have to continue posting here about my updates or are there designated threads to do this  Yesterday after having a hangover from new years eve was really tough  but I managed to keep it up and I'm still going strong    Back to work tomorrow but I will be present for my family and I will not drink today There's an entry in the sub's FAQ about this   tl dr  more booze remains than most people realize   Whether that makes cooking with booze "okay" depends on each person   I avoid foods cooked with booze but allow some things like vanilla extract in cookies and soy sauce with my sushi  I know it sounds scary but your body is urging you to binge because it is chronically hungry  Start slowly upping your calories by a few hundred every couple of weeks until you're up to a normal level where the binge eating reduces   Start at 1500 and make sure you actually eat  even if you think you're not hungry  I'm also considering how it may be due to other factors that I was ignoring because I was attributing it to the alcohol and yet even with the removal of it are still present   vitamin deficiency  not enough iron  not enough nutrients  old sleeping habits  body clock routines etc    Our first thought is to assume it is linked with alcohol withdrawal  but perhaps it's something else entirely that now needs addressing since we're in a better mindset to approach and consider it  and subsequently rectify    I'll be making a conscious effort to eat better and trying to reset my alarm clock so I'm getting up early regularly  which is difficult as I work late most nights  and seeing if that helps remove some of those waking symptoms    I shan't drink with you either  Best of luck   I made a list of things to do to keep me occupied  but I find my mind always coming back to "I can drink while doing those things " I'm unsure of how to break out of that mindset   I appreciate the response  Here's to another day 1 I guess  That's oddly specific    I will not drink today  I will not drink today   I would love to pull out a few quotes from your post  but the whole damned thing was just so good   Setting aside your writing style  which I thoroughly enjoy  you'r choice of quotes alone was wonderful  but the whole thing was just fantastic   I really appreciate that you took the time to show us what your journey has been like   I love hearing from people who have made it a year  which seems an age in my newly sober mind    it does more than give me a sense that this IS do able  it also reminds me that it's not all good all the time  but by accepting the tools  resources  advice and opportunities I have at my disposal  I can do it too   Anyway  congrats on year 1  and thank you  I hope to post something like this on my 365th day  It gets easier  Im not much further ahead than you are  but I find that most or my cravings are situational based  For example  after morning coffee I want a smoke  After time  the cravings and desires are more bearable  and only last a few fleeting moments    I find that smoking an invisible cigarette helps when it gets really bad  Just pretend that you are smoking and the deep breaths calm me down   You got this   Thank you for the reply  I also managed depression and anxiety with alcohol  which naturally made both worse  ultimately  I also used alcohol to socialize  After all  alcohol lowers inhibitions   How else would I confide in others  and vice versa  without it  How else would I be witty and charming rather than my laconic and introverted self  Without booze  I will never be that person exactly  but I've discovered already that I'm just as willing to listen to a person in need and sharper without the booze   But yeah  that first week was full of me feeling flat and dull  And I will probably feel that from time to time for a while   I think it's because I trained my brain to think there is no other way to relax  socialize  or have fun  I have to unlearn what I have learned  and that will require patience   practice  and time    Have you considered attending a support group like Smart Recovery or AA as part of a non boozy activity to fill an evening   Or   for that matter  another type of support group    Wishing you all the best   But its fun to lie about it right   Junkies live such a carefree casual accepted lifestyle  Holy Fuck Ive never heard of a more stupid arguement than  his   And S I added an edit to my other reply  In case you missed it  Unlike no nuts I Want the facts here  Keep it up   Sounds like a fantastic deal  Love when shit like that works out   So shoes MIA or did he take them  I'm not sure which test you bought  but most of those have an associated lab that you can send them out to  It's not cheap  but if it proves your point then it might be worth it  If not  buy one that does have a lab today  Take it in front of her and go to the post office with her to mail it out  That gave me goosebumps  Thank you for sharing and so many congratulations on 2016  3 What  I think it's interesting that you put your state of mine  hungry  down  When I was in rehab  they told us this acronym HALT   hungry  angry  lonely  tired   that would make you more likely to slip   drink  So  you know  halt if you're feeling those things  Thus was my first nye sober  too   good job     Congratulations  What an honest  beautiful post  You are an inspiration    I will not drink with you today   Could be wrong  but I think they're mixing up Gastrointestinal Disorders  GID  with Generalized Anxiety Disorder  GAD   I'm in literally the same situation  except I'm a guy  My fianc is wonderful and she constantly has to babysit me  My advice for you is to realize your blessings and use them as motivation  I will not drink with you today  Day13   I'm at the point now where I feel like I've done it  I've gotten through the woods   I don't worry about how where and when I'm going to take another dose    I don't feel anxious   I haven't noticed paws at all during this process     Still feeling a little sluggish but that could be from the weekend of unusually heavy drinking     My only problem now is that little voice in my head that says hey a small dose would be really nice right to clear up that hangover    I probably should just go to the gym   That should clear that up     Happy new years everyone    I'm so happy for you  3 This is for people struggling to quit forever  If you are looking to restart  you are in the wrong place    As someone who is just starting  reading this really  really helped  Just the drinking  Don't need it today  there's too much to be thankful for  Happy to not drink with you all today   I'll not drink with you today  I protected myself from alcohol by not having any in my home  staying out of bars and away from anyone who abused it  There's nothing so boring as watching others overdrink  I stayed home or went to an AA meeting rather than put myself in risky situations   And we are so disposed   Keep going mate  I freed myself from debilitating bine drinking and now I'm set to graduate with my English BA in May and start teaching high school English in the Fall  None of these things would be possible without being sober  I won't drink with any of you today   Checking in Check out the naked mind  free on sidebar    the 30 Day Sobriety Book  I've also downloaded the apps Habit Seed and Nomo  I'm trying to keep myself busy with fun sober activities  I have a very similar story to yours   will not drink with you today   Rehab is the best option  in my opinion  It was one of my best decisions and started me on the road to recovery  They will know how to treat your withdrawal  or refer you to an appropriate detox center   make a note of those feelings    specifically how awful you felt  and how fearful you were  hae it on hand so when you next have an urge to drink  you can read it and remember  the pain of the next day is not worth the poison  i have been doing this the last day or two and it helped me through NYE Here we go  Round two and you'll be stronger for it  I'm here because I want to stop letting my wife down and getting so crazy drunk that I shout and scream at her about     everything  I'm not drinking with you today    Black mucus and phlegm  for over a month  it happens   Checking in Stay strong   the holidays were especially tough for me too  I told my family I don't drink anymore yet I was offered alcohol at least twice and even given beer and wine as a present   I said no and gave that shit away to friends I know who will enjoy it   I will not drink with you today  This is awesome  I'm not down the road that far  but found I have an urge drive come along with quitting to do other beneficial things  I'm not sure if it's a subconscious thing to stay busy  some desire to take better care of myself after years of neglect or what  I've been doing situps pushups at night  drinking a lot more water  and cleaning the hell out of my house   Over my xmas NY break my wife and I purged probably 10 paper bags of clutter from various rooms of the house  reorganizing the kids' toys and whatnot  Maybe it's just that I'm not obsessed with going outside every hour or so to smoke and I actually notice have energy and time to devote to things I've put off or ignored  In any case  it feels amazing   Just wanted to say I think I can relate a little and good for you  I  too  have really enjoyed the freedom I feel from not smoking  Like "What do I want to do " with the answer being literally "anything" vs  never taking on "too much" before as it would prevent me from smoking     Great work and thanks for sharing  You're the one who started it yesterday   I know that feeling of waking up    like with eyes WIDE open thinking  "wtf    how did I even get in my bed "    It's the worst     Having the anxiety of going through my phone just terrified of what I could have sent people  or asked for     I am not drinking today with you   Let's do this  If you break down the amount of alcohol you would actually receive from eating a dish cooked with beer or wine  it's very very minimal    For instance  if you poured a whole bottle of wine into a stew  five drinks  and let it cook for an hour  it'd retain approximately 1 25 drinks total  If you think about it  pretty much any stew large enough to accommodate a whole bottle of wine is going to have alot of portions in it    So imagine that 1 25 drinks being split 6 or 8 ways  Even with seconds and large portions  IOW an  extreme  circumstance   you'd be getting less than half a drink    Point being  although there is clearly a school of thought that claims alcohol is so "cunning" that even a single drop  literally  should be avoided  there is another that would basically say   is it more disruptive to your joy happiness to feel you can't cook with wine than it is to ingest a very small quantity of booze in your food  Because realistically  things like over ripe fruit and all manner of sauces and condiments have little bits of alcohol in them    Speaking only for myself  those little anomalies were never my problem  Mine was with purchasing booze in a glass and consuming it liberally and repeatedly for hours  days or weeks at a time    So I will always drink Kombucha  would have a NA beer if it appealed to me and although I rarely cook with wine  wouldn't hesitate to do so if a recipe called for it  But I'd never  ever take a glass of beer  martini  etc to my lips    Just my 2c  Not fair  indeed  I don't think I was ever not drinking when I got the flu until a couple of weeks ago  I was rather amazed at the similarities of shittiness between a hang over and the flu  Who knew  I did something similar to you  Smoked about the same amount daily for nearly a decade and threw away  1000 worth of paraphernalia and took it one day at a time  I actually cried the night before because it felt like I was saying goodbye to a part of myself    and I was scared of who I'd become without it  That was almost two years ago now  Incredibly  the urges are still there    almost as if I had smoked yesterday  They are most strong when I'm bored  Watching movies  playing video games    none of it has the same appeal as it used to  Exercise has been the most crucial component for me    My best advice is to tell you that you'd be doing yourself a disservice if you think it's going to be easy  And the recovery from addiction never really ends  even with a substance like weed    Besides exercise  it's really important to find a new hobby or passion to replace all the time you used to spend getting high  For me  it was making music  but for others it might not be as simple as that  I think most marijuana addicts are always going to be addicted to something    it's just part of our personality  So the trick is to find a healthy alternative  Good luck  My intention is that if I'm out and about  I'll eat things cooked in alcohol  but won't use it to cook at home   I doubt I could stop myself from drinking what was left    Hi  I'm trying today to go to 3 grams  New Years Eve was awful with shaking  depression  racing heart and dizziness  Went to a restaurant for dinner and the noise and lighting made me feel horrible  Went to bed at 7 pm although very hard to sleep  This is the first time I have felt this horrible  Today is easier except for these nasty cravings  Kratom is constantly on my mind  The psychological part is very hard because the first thing I go for when awakening is that first dose  I'm very anxious  so lethargic and down   Why not  If I may ask  AA made you toss those drinks back  Just ran my first 4k since a while  That should help me through day 2    Hello me  Yup  I am also in the same situation  drinking til I black out  behaving horrifically  swearing 'never again' then doing it all over again   Same  guilt  embarrassment  the whole package  over and over and over again   And the fear of failing   If I try and fail  that's so much worse   But  failure is not inevitable  and it is possible to stop   It IS   This is a great place to be for advice and friendly  non judgemental support   People here have all reached a point where they realise they can't  won't go on as they are  so there is no need to cover things up   My advice  for what it's worth  I am pretty new to this   is to read the posts here  talk openly here about your fears and worries  use the resources listed on the sidebar  the books and FAQs especially     If you can  find someone in real life that you can speak to  doctor  trusted friend or family members  counsellor etc   and be brutally honest about the situation     You can do this  you have support here  and I will not drink with you today    Here's a resource that you can browse  Hope it helps  I'm sorry this is happening  Others have given you excellent suggestions      http   kidshealth org en teens coping alcoholic html Good for you  I will not drink with you today  x Welcome  I won't drink with you today    i absolutely agree  the past year or more   ive learned a lot when it comes to relapsing in a healthy way    or even just dealing with any kind of failure in a healthy way  i like to 1  come to terms with my bad guilty feelings 2  find something to feel good about 3  brush off my shoulders and keep going  The hardest part is  2  I like to look back at how addicted i used to be  even just 2 years go  and think about how ive gotten to where i am today So glad you can share the knowledge  Happy New Year   Yeah  that was me  too   LOVE this  Will give it a try today when I start to feel listless  Thanks for posting  Thank you hexqueen  Happy New Year   Oh I see  that's good     Why do you think that the community needs to be harder on you  Is it because you think that is what will trigger the inner change  It sounds like you don't have the confidence that you can create that change on your own   There is something psychologically holding you back  and until now you have never successfully stuck to your plans because you are not aware of what it is that's holding you back   You gotta try to figure that out   Are you comfortable with serious introspection   5 days is something for sure  I must have tried to quit 100 times  most of them lasting about a day or less  It's so crushing to go to bed so determined and wake up with literally none of the resolve I had the night before   So  yeah  when something like a day 3 or 5 rolls around it feels like riding a bike with no training wheels for the first time  Celebrate away and be proud  Update  chatted it out with my housemate  She didn't realise it made me uncomfortable and won't bring him over as often or for as long  and if he is over he won't be in the communal spaces so I can cook in my pants and not feel weird  I really think my sobriety is allowing me to be a grown up and sort things like this out quickly  Rather than dwell and get angry  Hooray  The liquor industry is covered because they tell you to drink responsibly   https   youtu be EJT0NMYHeGw I will not drink today  That is impressive    Do you still have to make a big effort not to drink after so long  While I agree with  u mj0r I think this comment is both a bit harsh and naive  People have gone back out over the most trivial of things  A broken shoelace was the infamous one in my old home group  Kratom could definitely do it if the person was not ready to give up    If you think an active opioid like Kratom could not be the trigger to get you back on the needle then I strongly suggest you reevaluate your complacency  There's book in the side bar called This Naked Mind  give it read  it helps a lot and you can join IRC as well  thanks for the response      the thing that really bothers me is i tell them straight up  i am an alcoholic  and i cannot be trusted to drink alcohol  i will drink myself to a very early grave if i do not stop  im 22  etc etc  obviously i cannot make them stop drinking themselves          but it feels like i am trying to quit heroin  and all my immedeate family have needles and and dope lying around the house  because thats what alcohol has become for me  a hard drug that i only take alone  and for them they need at every single social event    and i keep wanting to distance myself from them  and i am not sure if that is a wise choice or not  The 4th step should also include positive characteristics  not just negatives  It's also important to do a fifth step as soon as you can  This is an important growth step  Feeling shame and regret is normal and healthy  When we are sober  it is much less likely we will engage in the behaviors that are causing you pain now  They are in the past  not today  You have changed  Wouldn't it be sad if you were so cold and hardened that you didn't feel regret   I avoided parties where alcohol was central for the first 3 or four months sober  Now that we are out of the holiday season  for the most part  that shouldn't be too hard to avoid  Once I was comfortable with my sober self I found it much easier than I thought possible to go and have fun with friends without drinking  I make sure to bring my favorite NA drink  usually some kind of spicy ginger ale  bonus points if it looks a bit like a beer bottle   and have a plan to leave early if I get uncomfortable  Best wishes  Day 13 here  I am exactly where you are at too    libido and appetite are in full swing  been drinking pretty frequently  im mostly fine but sleep is hit or miss  Last couple lines in your post resonate heavily with me  bagfullofbuckles  Lets fight this shit  And TypicalStoryTime  youre almost over the hump my man  Youll be feeling GREAT so so soon It's really interesting to just observe now   and be grateful we got out  Not today  Yassss   You're awesome  The storm before the calm  Pearl stay right here and ADJUST  You know a few days and back to good  You

could relate so much to everything you wrote   My life was a total mess too   I couldn't see it then  could only see some of the problems  many others I blamed on circumstance or other people   but I see it very clearly now   Mentally I was a wreck   Numb  apathetic  irritable  hating myself  resentful at life  making horrible decisions with major consequences   I felt completely stuck and hopeless   I couldn't clearly see my problems  and I couldn't see the connections between every one of my problems and my compulsive gaming   Today it's crystal clear   Constant gaming and sleep deprivation were trashing every single area of my life   I also couldn't see light at the end of the tunnel back then   Today the light is all around me  I'm living life and walking through the tough stuff  taking care of myself  engaging with people  learning  growing  appreciating   My motivation has come back to life   I'm more often positive than negative these days   I see the progress I've made and the actions I had to take to get here and I'm motivated to keep putting one foot in front of the other and enjoying the journey   When I was in the depths of the addiction  it's like I had a thick black cloud around my head  blinding me to the reality of my situation and the possibilities that lie beyond   That darkness seemed impenetrable and permanent   But that was an illusion   I just needed some support and guidance in getting honest with myself  taking effective action  avoiding self destructive action  and accepting what I needed to heal and learn and grow   If you want to

definitely true  I was on this sub every 40 to 60 minutes until day 6 or 7   That plus youtube sitting in bed  hoping for 20 minute naps while on my Gatorade drip   Since I've started some books  have great support from wifey  saw a doctor    even tried NA beer so I could still enjoy pizza   football   I've been super busy with moving and looking for a new career so that has helped   Meditation is

great many of us did not come from a background of heavy problem drinkers  if not downright alcoholics  It's an environment and possible genetic component at work  I know that's true of my family too  In my case  it made my family super uncomfortable to find out I'd quit drinking  I think because it made them question their own consumption  I learned to have patience with them  and make my excuses and leave early if feeling uncomfortable  There is no need to cut yourself off from your family  but I made room in my life to care for myself first  which felt a bit selfish but was really what I needed  Now that I am much firmer in my sobriety I have no problem being around people who drink  even to excess  Best wishes  I am halfway with you   Quitting smoking at the same time would be tough   I have slowed down my smoking tho    and I am confident that with no more drinking  which when I drink heavy  easily I smoke a pack at night    I will eventually be there with you   Best of luck  Glad to hear that man  Stay away from those  I'm on my last pack currently   Parents house  Their wine  I will not buy it ever again  Not even to cook  Yes  and no  The physical urge fades over time however even that is still a trap  and a pretty big one  Just because I have not had a drink in a long time does not mean I don't have a problem with it and it gets easy to forget that which  leads back to 'since I have not had a drink in a long time  maybe I could have one ' yeah That is the little reminder that I still have an issue with the drink and I still have to have my guard up and go to meetings  It is that cunning for me  Otherwise I am literally able to go long spans of time without even thinking about booze  but just because the physical urge is gone  the mental one is still there from time to time  Well  day two and I'm not experiencing anything physically wrong  just a bit nervous and mentally fried but I'm not sure if it's the lack of alcohol or something else  I'll keep an eye out and make sure everything else is good   Aw  man  my eyes are leaking  So glad you're here with us  Thank you so much for sharing your story  I will not drink with you today   I used to do this  Didn't work too well for me  I got real tired of people telling me how they don't drink as much as they use to  And the ones that are still where I was seem a little uncomfortable with me  I have new friends now  It takes time  If the reason for these events is to get drunk  I wouldn't even consider it  Remember the reason your going if you do and always have an escape plan  Good luck Thank you for taking time to tell us your story  You are an inspiration   Hello and welcome  I'm glad you're eyes are opening  I hope you'll find this sub is just where you need to be      I'm a day or two late to the game  but have been clean since the end of December    so sign me up if possible  Else  I'll just check in as I go  Happy new year  all  If they go back then thats on them  I'm talking about using kratom as a stepping stone  I will not drink today   I found it really helpful  as a result of reading  The Easy Way   to reflect on what nicotine is was really doing for me  Like back in time  what was my 7th grade self lacking that improved upon taking in nicotine  Did it improve anything   All I could really ever come up with was feeling sort of a dizzy rush for a few seconds and fitting in with the kid I wanted to think I was cool   Fast forward 15 years  What was nicotine doing for me  I honestly couldn't answer the question  I was waaaay past the point of saying stuff like "it relieves stress" or "it relaxes me " I just believed I needed nicotine  but couldn't verbalize any specific reason  It was more that I was scared about not having it or losing out on  something   even though I couldn't name it  that made stopping seem terrifying and impossible   A lot of the time it wasn't this conscious  but I noticed feeling antsy  irritable  distracted  thoughts running a mile a minute  etc  when I'd try to quit  perhaps like you're describing    I posted about the mental quandary I was in  here  https   www reddit com r stopsmoking comments 5hsrh5 easy way subscribers help processing my  if you want to take a look  It finally came down to believing that nicotine is the reason I felt like nicotine did something for me  Rationally  I couldn't name anything so what should be the big deal about stopping  Why should I feel antsy about quitting something where I can't even name a genuine pleasure benefit improvement    Anyway  I share this way of thinking as I hope you can get to the point some way or another where you aren't in a "battle " This last time for me I didn't experience any cravings at all  I have some hyper awareness  like "I don't think I'm craving  Am I craving  No  I'm not  But am I "  about being a non smoker  but not anguish or feeling miserable  It's been great  The times where I've had to grit my teeth constantly have always led to me crumbling  This approach  where I don't "fight" anything because I don't even think nicotine would provide me anything desirable  has been wonderful   Good luck to you and congratulations on both your time without a cigarette as well as continuing to push for self improvement  I'm 2  Feeling good  Nice not to wake up with a headache      We're glad you have you here  It's been good to see your username again  You know what really pisses him off  When you mispronounce it with a southern accent  Deeewaaars   Thanks for the wishes  I guess I wasn't trying to avoid the parties because most were pretty important in some way or another  I was also testing myself in a way since alcohol is embedded into my friends culture but they are the kind of people that can put half a glass down and be done which was never me  I have been using black coffee as a go to though when I feel it's getting to be too much or I need a pick me up  Yay for round 2  Hop on up here and tell us how it happened and what you learned    so we can learn  Welcome back  2016 was a rough year to stay sober in  that's for sure  Take it easy  I posted about this yesterday simply b c my 2016 ran similarly  I spoke with my father about my lackluster performance in my efforts to quit and he provided the following perspective  Paraphrasing  he explained to me that 2016 was my 1st year that I attempted to quit drinking and it didn't go perfectly  He explained that it was okay  He explained that I am quitting something that I have relied on for everything  celebrations  failures  love  heartbreaks  lifts  losses  coping essentially   for over a decade  He explained that it will take time  He explained that this scotch will be my last drink ever  He explained that 2016 was my 'crawl'  He explained that 2017 will be my 'walk' and 'run'   Use 2017 to 'run'    Good luck and congrats on starting up again    Thank you  It is hard not wanting to jump but i will stay on course  Mexico isn't until the end of January and I want to be feeling a little better by then  The weather here is so cold with very little sun right now  It seems to get harder on the bones the older I get  I am hoping a week in the sun will be a boost   Thanks  I'm doing my fifth step in a few days  I guess I just need some time between now and these realizations about myself    u otitropanit is right   Here is a link to find Alateen meetings in the U S  http   al anon info MeetingSearch AlateenMeetings aspx language EN This is a support group for young people affected by someone else's drinking   You could help your siblings find a way to get to their nearest meeting   I've heard teens say that even though they resisted this idea at first  they are glad someone made them go   My first check in of 2017  Happy New Year everyone  I wish you all happiness and peace  I will not drink with you today Right on and all the more power to you    I was just trying to say there are several schools of thought and that by no means is there a unanimous consensus among  say  medical professionals that trace amounts of ethanol in food have any bearing on one's decision to be abstinent  My own GP looked at me like I was crazy when I asked about this once   I like to make an Italian Zuppa Di Pesce once a year  well  I should say that I can  afford  to make it once a year       and cannot imagine leaving out the white wine  Just looked up my recipe though and realized it calls for 25 ml per serving  IOW about 1 6th of a glass  before  cooking   Cheers and good luck  You got this   I will not drink today  No matter what happens  I will face the night without dulling my senses  hard as that may be  good going for 16days  well done  I most certainly need to go back to doctors regards depression  I put this off as the thought of anti depressants scares me  but its got to be better than the self medicating with alcohol that Ive been doing  Thank you  your words mean a lot  its been a long time since anyone told me they are proud of me  And yes please it would be great to know others are not drinking with me today and i am not alone  So  so  so  so true  This is awesome and I am so grateful for moments like this as well  I've also been late and winded  not ridiculously but enough where I really have to focus on breathing "normal"  after a couple flights of stairs heading to a meeting  Picking a seat in the room sort of removed from people  not looking at them directly when I talk  always having coffee to try and mask the smell  carrying baby wipes in my car to wipe my hands face  etc   I was a major closet smoker  terrified of anyone at working knowing so it required jumping through  a lot  of hoops  It really made me ashamed of who I'd become due to my addiction  Avoiding after work get togethers because they'd be in close quarters and I always wanted to smoke first thing after work  Trying to avoid giving people rides in case my car smelled  Going in to work late and leaving early to smoke more  It's crazy what I did for cigarettes   Thanks for sharing this  It's a really good reminder that there's these sorts of opportunities for gratitude aaaaallll around to be thankful for each day  'Run' with us in 2017  Utilize r SD as your source of spiritual hydration  sustenance  and support   Keep on and good luck  We all can do it      I agree    I have quit smoking for 3 years I think  However  I will smoke about 3 5 cigarretes a YEAR  But I do not count them as relapse as I have beaten the awful habit of smoking  Max is right  You can stop this right here  right now  I don't ever need to feel like that again  I hated it and it really scared me  Turns out that feeling like that is optional  It's my option to choose  All mine  Yours too  Jump in with us here at SD  Let's not drink today  I'm here  I'll be sober today  I woke up feeling down and quite annoyed at life for no apparent reason  O' well     "You will not be punished for your anger  you will be punished by your anger " That's a big one for me  I can sometimes  feel  my liver when I'm in bed  A huge part of giving up booze is so I don't develop alcohol induced hepatitis at some point  or if it just packs up entirely  Thanks for the comment  it's definitely one of the biggest reasons  I know when I first stopped I felt overwhelmed  The thoughts of shame  guilt  remorse  angst  all threatened to drown me    What worked for me was to try and ignore the big picture  forget ALL the regret of the past  ALL the times I'd embarrassed myself  ALL the times I'd driven drunk and the shame that created    In the past  I would have a few drinks and could ignore all the noise in my head  But then I just decided on not drinking in that moment  I simply narrowed my focus  putting blinders on  what can I do TODAY to put myself in the best position to NOT drink    Then  after I strung a few sober days together  the noise started to subside  I felt stronger  more capable of facing all those things I'd done wrong  and trying to build a life where I wouldn't do them again    So my advice is to narrow your focus to what you can change today  no drinking  no "buzzed" driving  no black outs  no embarrassing episodes  The rest will come in time  Good luck  HALT has helped me a few times  I add an S for sick in case I'm catching a cold  It also helps me keep my temper with others  Are they hungry  Angry  Etc  This also helps me to not drink  People ask me why I stopped drinking  The problem is  the original reason becomes harder to say because my reasons are both increasing and evolving  As time goes by  drinking again seems to become less of an option  I suspect this is partly due to my identity   self perception evolving   I'm simply becoming a different person from making lasting positive decisions  It's a nice feeling  It's not a failure if you can learn something from it  It took me a number of stops and starts to 'get it ' I like the idea of printing it out and reading it  I keep a journal for that reason  Long after I've forgotten how bad it was  all it takes is a quick read through to remember why I don't drink anymore  Good luck  Woot  woot    You came to a good place  my friend  This is a great supportive community  It is going to be hard at first  You have to get through the first few days  but eventually  it will get better  You are strong  You can do this  We will be here for you to vent to   Back to the restaurant where I am the only bartender  I will not drink today  no matter how tempting  Barely 1000 is not a good day  Restricting is as bad if not worse than bingeing  You need to change your mindset   Any idea how long it takes for a gaming addict's brain to return to normal  I've been addicted to pvp games on and off for maybe 15 years now  Is there any stat on how long it'd take for my brain to return to normal after quitting  Its awesome to here someone say they 'stepped off' and it was okay  That's the whole point of the taper  right  I'm just gonna keep chipping away  I only ended up taking 19 grams yesterday  instead of 20    basically just taking as little as possible and saving it for before bed  I ended up having more than enough to get through the night  so I did well  Today I'll give myself up to 20 grams and if I need the whole thing  that's okay  20 grams is not nothing  but it's a hell of a lot less than I was taking  I AM ready to quit  I can only see things getting worse if I don't  My eyes are open  and once that happens  it's impossible to go back to your own ways without that voice constantly reminding you of what you're getting yourself into  I already feel way different  I was pretty numbed up from that stuff  I'm ready to learn to live with myself without being altered   even if it is hard  And I don't wanna hurt myself anymore    I love FR  I had the opportunity to see them earlier in 2016  before I got sober  Beautiful show  Wonderful song  Thanks for sharing     I will not drink today  Brilliant  Schedule the 5th step  and get it done  You'll hear people say that most people go back out at the 4th step and the 9th step  I felt terrible after completing my 4th step  I ignorantly sat in that feeling for 2 months  before someone recognized what was going on and recommended the above  The cathartic feeling didn't come from writing it out for me  The cathartic feeling came from admitting to God  myself  and another human being the exact nature of my wrongs  Sitting in the 4th step is a bad place to linger  Get the 5th step scheduled  and the sooner the better  Know that what you're feeling right now is natural  It shouldn't feel great to look at our character defects  especially when we've been blind to them  The fact that you feel the way you feel  is proof that you've done a thorough and honest 4th step  You're exactly where you're supposed to be  Now move forward  I will not drink with you   My best memories were of sober summers just enjoying life as it should be   Keep drawing on the good times you had in your sober summer     i will not drink today Your whole first paragraph describes me so well too  And regards the obsession I hear you on that one  I realised recently even although I dont drink from the minute my eyes open  I am thinking about it usually to convince myself I won't drink that evening  which changes throughout the day to "i will just have a couple" then depending on how day pans out will result in a 12 pack  You have done amazingly to manage 86 days and I want to be there as well  Thank you for your support  Awesome job making a tough decision  Keep strong  and good things will come   Okay  so u do get me  I've done cold turkey off full blown opiates and the physical stuff was awful  The mental part sucked but Kratom is definitely more challenging for me  I'd totally check into a psych ward if I could do it  That's just plain responsible   That's definitely how I feel  I gave up booze in Thailand for a couple of weeks and I found myself just going for long solitary walks by myself and becoming a little introverted because I genuinely thought people would be bored of me without alcohol in me  I think you're right about un learning things  I hope it goes well for you   I'm a little concerned about the support groups  My main concerns are     I don't want to be the guy sat there whilst everyone pours their hearts out  and I really have nothing to say other than 'I developed an addiction predominantly out of selfishness with no real reason to do so'   I'm concerned that groups like AA teach you that you do not have control over your disease  and therefore you must engage in a 12 step programme or something similar  Correct me if I'm wrong  but aren't a lot of AA groups concurrent with almost religious organisations  about relinquishing control to a higher power and engaging solely in the programme  I'd love to be able to talk to people impartially about my addiction  but I don't want to be part of any kind of group where you get a chip or something for every week without alcohol  That for me just makes me feel like it's  only a matter of time  until you relapse  something I don't want to do   Thanks a lot again for your continues replies    You're the one in control of your actions   You  did the hard work   congratulations  I understand the sentiment  And I agree  even though it would not have worked for me  However  I was replying to the context of your comment  It is entirely possible to end up back on the street from Kratom  With it been a steeping stone in the other direction  back to H  for some  Hence the broken shoelace example  Keep smelling awesome  Awesome  Congrats     Where I clung to my expectations about what life was supposed to be  about what I deserved  that's where I suffered  How limiting  if I were the one to decide my experience  It's a big  beautiful  terrifying world out there  and I can't wait to see what tomorrow brings   That's a great observation  I'm sticking it in my stopdrinking quote bag     Yeah  I was thinking a gradual approach  too  Now that I have taken my first step down  hopefully the next will be easier  I had a buddy switch from cigs to pot  He said once he got to a certain nicotine level in his juice  he began smoking pot and got a similar gratifying effect to cigs  Then after 8 or 10 months of pot  he tried a cig again and he wanted to gag after one puff  I don't make 75K a year like he does  so he can afford this solution        Good to hear   Not drinking with you today      hoose Life  Choose a job  Choose a career  Choose a family  Choose a fucking big television  choose washing machines  cars  compact disc players and electrical tin openers  Choose good health  low cholesterol  and dental insurance  Choose fixed interest mortgage repayments  Choose a starter home  Choose your friends  Choose leisurewear and matching luggage  Choose a three piece suit on hire purchase in a range of fucking fabrics  Choose DIY and wondering who the fuck you are on Sunday morning  Choose sitting on that couch watching mind numbing  spirit crushing game shows  stuffing fucking junk food into your mouth  Choose rotting away at the end of it all  pissing your last in a miserable home  nothing more than an embarrassment to the selfish  fucked up brats you spawned to replace yourselves  Choose your future  Choose life      But why would I want to do a thing like that         Sigh  it's your quote dude  I am literally in the same boat as you but I haven't quit cigs yet  not for a lack of trying   How did you go about that  I've tried weening and cold turkey and failed at both  Thank you   Thank you  I would also love to know where to find them  Well done on your great week  I have kept myself isolated so I can just get on with drinking myself to death without other peoples pity or disappointment  Coming on here today is the best thing I have done in a long time   Who gave you an at home drug test  and why   Also  has your girlfriend ever been to a Nar Anon or Al Anon meeting  or to  r AlAnon or the slow moving  r NarAnon  I saw them a few years ago   great show  great band  so many powerful songs  On their site  they sell shot glasses with "I wish I was sober" printed on them   it's amazing how transparent the lying And minimizing is when you are sober  also  sad   Congrats on 1 year   100 days  i was definitely a bit harsh for no reason  didn't really help get my point across   just woke up for work when i commented and i'm a cranky morning person  i don't really see the naivety in my comment but i could certainly be missing something  like you said anything can send someone back out if they are not ready to stop which include kratom of course  if they are ready to stop then they will stop and kratom will not put them back on the street  if it does put them back on the street they were not ready to stop  It's good for me to hear this    I've heard that voice you're talking about today  since I have not had a drink in a long time  maybe I could have one    and I'm just at day 2    It's good for me to know that that is not going anywhere anytime soon and I have to keep my guard up  It's inspiring for me to hear from someone who has been able to do so for so long  Thanks Well done and for not giving up after a set back  its not easy to do that  The support you have offered is helping me so much  Not OP but mine were SO much worse  and usually lasted 2 days  I got horrendously drunk on New Year's Eve but feel great today  I had never heard of pancreatitis until recently    About three weeks ago I started to get a pain in my left side just below my ribcage that wouldn't go away  I had been bloated for months and figured it was just what it felt like to be fat  gained 40 lbs over the past 2 years   I was used to occasional pains on the other side of my body  liver   but this was a new one  and much  much worse  Didn't want to eat  Heartburn every afternoon  When it just got worse and worse  I looked up my symptoms and knew immediately it was pancreatitis    Had one drink the next three nights to taper and none ever since  Pain went away within a day or two of tapering  Bloating is gone  no more heartburn  It's good to feel sort of young again   Sometimes a life or death scare is the kick in the pants we need to turn our life around   Thank you so much for sharing  You can do it  this is my day 1  we will keep each other in check I will not drink today  My sleep has been awful too  I already had a problem staying up way too late and not smoking has made it much harder to go to sleep  I've been getting 4 5 hours of crappy sleep a night  I actually just woke up from one of my first uninterrupted 8 hours  had a dream for the first time in months  but still feeling kind of groggy for sure  Oh well one improvement at a time I guess See  I get confused cuz grams is weight and a teaspoon is volume  I'm just capping my Kratom in the 00 caps  Each cap is about  5 grams  I figure the main thing is that u have to have some way to know that you're taking less  As long as u can tell that ur taking less  u know you're getting somewhere  The caps are a way I can do that    I'm scared too  but I also know that it can be done and fear is how we torture ourselves  even if nothing bad is actually happening to us  I'm trying to keep the fear in check  A little less over time and eventually that'll be very little and then nothing  I'm sorry you're stuck in this  but hey  we're together  right  R u gonna get a scale  A capping thing   Good luck  We all came to that point where we say enough is enough  You have a good community here that will be there for you when you are struggling  Soon  you will be at a place where YOU can help those people starting the same journey  Stay strong  It takes will power   You can call yourself whatever   an alcoholic  a problem drinker  someone who doesn't drink   The list of options is almost endless but as long as you are comfortable with how you understand the definition  that is okay for now    I prefer to say that I have a medical condition and that condition is called Alcohol Use Disorder   Do bear in mind that although you are comfortable with the term 'alcoholic'  calling yourself that to too many people may have results that you don't intend    The term alcoholic still has a stigma attached to it  and though that shouldn't be the case  the fact is that it is   People may not trust you as much as you would hope because they have a pre conceived idea of the word that doesn't match your description of it   They may understand the term alcoholic to be a weak willed individual who will lie and cheat and steal   You have already seen that as people put 2 and 2 together and reach 5  because they expected this definition to have been the reason that you were homeless   Alcohol Use Disorder is a spectrum  a range of conditions from mildly dependent to binger to highly dependent   It is a recognised medical term  for a medical condition   And most importantly  it is a term that does not give off so many negative vibes for people who have never experienced alcoholism and take their definition for it from the movies  and soap operas   which usually portray a dependent drinker is such a negative light   Those with diabetes don't call themselves a sugar addict  they say that they have diabetes which is a medical condition   People don't automatically jump to the conclusion that the person was a weak individual for eating too much of the wrong stuff and not exercising enough  Some great points here   I've been looking into karezza and find it very intriguing  because we equate sex to orgasm  but karezza limits orgasm  yet encourages sex   I wonder if we all have a false premise about orgasm being a positive for mental health   I used to think so  but my husband and I are on a 90 day reboot mard mode and we are happier  more affectionate  more interactive  respectful  loving  but damn is it FRUSTRATING at times   Plus my husband's ass is huge and perfect  so that doesn't help me any when he's changing in front of me   UGH god   K   Done perving out   Anyways  about the whole lusting and appreciating women's bodies  I think that's okay so long as it's not solely a sexual feeling   Women  are  beautiful   But especially with porn addiction  it's hard for some to view women's bodies and think anything but sex  like objectifying them   I feel like it's a confusing grey area   We're programmed to seek healthy mates that will benefit us in procreating and spreading our genes advantageously  but with the advent of false images  porn  magazines  tv  our brain is being super charged by potential mates that are perfect by the boatload  and we aren't designed to really handle that from an evolutionary perspective   Our brains don't know the difference between projections of images vs real people  despite us consciously understanding they aren't real  according to Satoshi Kanazawa  an evolutionary psychologist  and flippin genius    So  it's tough to know about that  and what kind of appreciation is okay   I once read a great point about lusting after women   A guy said  it's not similar to a landscape or a rainbow   You can't have sex or have a relationship with or interact with a landscape or a rainbow   That point stuck with me   I do know that my husband and I have a rule that we don't check people out around eachother  because it's hurftul  but we kind of understand that it happens outside of eachother's presence    I can say from personal experience that appreciation of someone can slip easily to extreme lust   I have no good suggestions on how to stop that  I had a coworker that one day I noticed how attractive he was  and then i full on was sexualizing him and checking out his ass and thinking really dirty thoughts all day at work  and sometimes dreaming about him   I could not have a normal interaction with him necause I was perving out on him hardcore and was awkward and not listening to him or having normal conversations   I think that was unfair to him  not healthy for my marriage  although my husband checked people out all the time around me  so I wasn't very comverned about his feelings at the time and negative   So  i dunno about all that   Maybe focusing energy on the significant other  if you have one  and building a strong healthy relationship takes care of most of that   I know that when things were good with my husband  I wasn't interested in other men to the point of perving out   great post with a lot of great thoughts and ideas   Thank you   3 Yep    My life as well as you know    I really enjoy losing absolutely everything repeatedly  It's fucking fantastic   Just do it    i did this for thirty years  don't wait 30 years    i can't even tell you how much better my life is today than it was on this day one year ago  my only regret is that i wasted so much time   Did you make it past New Years  Not being offensive just hoping you made it through without alcohol  Oh fucking thanks Fash       It is truly amazing when someone can stick to something like this for two months  4 grams day is so little  lol  Good job   I'm curious why you had to switch strains  I'm thinking I have enough to stick with the same strain the whole way  However  I'll have to open new bags  which bugs me  because each batch can be a little different  I'm using half green Maeng Da and half natural Thai    I thought a teaspoon was 3 5 grams  I'm very likely wrong tho  Lol  I've capping my doses with the 00 caps   Same story here  Except I messed up a couple of months earlier than December    I join you in another round and am not drinking tonight goddammit  Let's do this  My girlfriend's sister in law just passed away a couple months ago having the same drinking habits of you  She'd been doing it for 20 years tho  bottle of wine or two a night to herself  all while having a loving husband and daughter  She just couldn't make it for them tho  I only mention this because it happened and it's very real and very scary  You're taking the right steps and I'm so happy you're going ahead  Keep it up   Just about the same thing happened to me  I was nauseous when I went to bed NYE and spent yesterday watching TV  which I never do all day because it gives me trouble sleeping  Instead I slept last night for hours and didn't wake up today until 10 30  I haven't slept that late since I was drinking  I feel absolutely fine now  Maybe it was a sympathetic hangover   And I'm damn proud of us  too  This is an awesome story   Thanks for sharing  This   IS   a great place isn't it   Enjoy your day  Dude  I'm shoveling 40 caps down my throat a day and I thought that was 20 grams  Maybe I have zero idea what I'm taking and need to go buy a scale after all   sign me up  please Not you  u mj0r  I meant for the comment I replied to  I name dropped you as I agreed with your comment  You went about saying it in the right way in my book  The poster of the comment above  the OP   did not   Damn man  you're hardcore  I've been kind of easing myself back into it  Although  my first week I had a couple of beers and watched game 7 of the World Series with some friends  But yeah  that was definitely quitting on hard mode  Shit   haha  This sub was my main support in getting sober  I like that I could browse at my leisure and find ideas and inspiration  it was good to know I wasn't alone in my struggles and goals   I attended SMART Recovery for a while after about 9 months sober  I already knew I aligned with their approach and it was nice to get some face to face contact with other people in recovery  My approach is self empowered and I've found tools and techniques from both SMART and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy to be useful  If he comes for a rebuttal Im not sure to be in awe for the nerve or in awe for the pure stupidity of him  Lets  see what course of action he takes   I would just like to say  If reading this numbnuts just keep going  Nothing to see  or gain here so just keep walking  Thank  You  Wow  that's a frightening story  I think you're very lucky to not have killed or seriously harmed yourself  your friends  or innocent drivers and their families    Do you think you want to quit  I kept drinking after my second DUI and things only got worse  I'm 31 now and I wish I had stayed sober the first time I got clean  at 20  It only got worse for me  Even when I wasn't driving due to suspension  bad things kept happening   I think this could be a great opportunity for you to make some changes in your life and have a happy and healthy 2017  It may get worse before it gets better  but drinking helps nothing  in my experience   Sorry you're dealing with the fallout from this  but I'm happy everyone is alive and safe   Thank you  I need this  I am on day 2 again  It feels like it has been weeks though  It is all I can think about   this is a great post  i barely made any wanking motions at all    congrats and good luck  keep doing the work   Initally he didn't and his drinking problem persisted because I conspired in essence with him  He would start back toward saying it was under control etc and I would go along because I didn't want to rock the boat  I realized we both needed it out in the open so we couldn't ignore it anymore  Huh  maybe I'll give that a shot  I did already kill an aloe plant though  so I'm not optimistic   I kept it on hold as well  but have been easing myself back into drinking  I started going out and getting beers again a few weeks back  But I'd never gotten hammered  But it's whatever works for the individual  Best of luck to both of you  these wins are pretty rad  I am at the same point  I will be making a new years resolution to stop drinking   If I can't hold back by my own willpower then I will seek outside help   The best of luck to you   and I said I would finish the corn    I got the day off  Just sitting here morning beer  waiting for the GF to get off work  Actually a pretty great day for me                 Holiday's didn't even really go that incredibly bad  I mean x mas always sucks  but we did the morning with the GF's family and her son  which was actually pretty fun  Like  it is a kid's holiday  Watching him open all the cool shit we bought him was super fun  Ity wasn't until the afternoon  when we had to go do my family  that shit got awful  Ugggggh  Being sober and making a big deal out of a fucking meal  Kill me now  But hey  at least we can have long conversations about which roads connect to which and how much different this town looked 20 years ago  you know the most banal of all conversations  Oh  ya  of course we can  Great  Where were we on the "Kill Me Now" part  I need a status update pronto               But  like you said  it's all over now  and I'm back on my normal drunk schedule  so cheers  I definitely don't have the smoked out throat  but my hangovers have been pretty bad  I'm in my 30's  32 to be exact  and I'm told they start getting pretty rough around this age though  so I'm not shocked  haha  But I definitely don't wake up feeling like I swallowed a bunch of broken glass  Jesus thats a mammoth drop  How are you holding up  Good contribution   I needed not to be a party to the awful secret  I needed support  Stick with it   I'm a guy tired of embarrassing myself in front of friends and family  tired of waking up without being able to remember huge chunks of evenings  tired of experiencing panic inducing hangovers and the list goes on and on   I know if I have one glass of wine I will feel cheated if i can't finish the bottle   I don't like the person that I have become and that is why I will not be drinking with you today    Thats really sad  condolences to your GF and family  It is really scary as Thats not far off where I am  Built it up over 15 years from just drinking at weekends to adding a extra day either side  to every single day  Kidding myself that its not that bad cause usually just beer I drink  so its not real alcohol and wouldn't do that much harm  Appreciate the message and support  just what I needed today  Now three drinks in  I agree 1000     I'm soft when I first wake up  Now I'm loaded for bear    Where is Bear  January 1st                     4 years   many thanks to the subscribers here  you have helped immensely   Thank you    We have  sign me up Also I think at the time if goven the option he wouldn't have told anyone but I basically was at the end of my rope and I was like either you get serious or I gotta get serious about my next steps   You are doing it right  Yeah  it is painful to uncover the wreckage of our past  But as has already been pointed out  that is necessary to get to the 5th step  Then you can do 6 and 7  And you will feel better until you get to the next hard part with 8 and 9    Remember when you admitted that your life was unmanageable  Well  now you have a better idea of what that means  Remember that you just looked into all those dark spots with honesty  You felt all those feelings that came up  AND YOU DIDN'T DRINK OR USE     I repeat  you are doing it right   Early on  I kept myself occupied by gaming  reading  watching TV  and going for walks when I had the energy  Later on  I got more active  joined a gym  and took up cycling  I switched to sparkling water to satisfy the habit  steering my urges over to that instead  I will not drink today I know the feeling  My parents raised us in AA and alanon   They are both 30  years sober   I understand that some people find it effective  it's just not for me  I've only attended a handful of meetings  but I find the environment very depressing  Every one has their own way of dealing with alcohol  and the "admitting you're powerless" thing has always turned me off  Here's to not drinking today  friend  I'm giving it a go as well  Today I will not drink with you all  Understanding where you're at and how you got there gives you the opportunity to change where you're going   That was one of the huge benefits things I learned from the 4th and 5th steps   I had to forgive myself for what I'd previously done to myself and my life   There was nothing I could do to change the past   I could only change the present so that the future would be different   Holding onto the negative feelings associated with my past was only getting in the way of me becoming the better person I wanted to be   What you're feeling is right in line from what I felt   As others have suggested  get on that 5th step ASAP   The relief you'll feel afterwards is enormous  I'm not drinking today  Sorry you had to see that  I witnessed a fatal motorcycle accident when I was a teenager  I will never ride a motorcycle because of it  I agree with many of your points here  I also hate the cliche that "alcohol is cunning  baffling and powerful"  Um  no  it's a substance  One that disagrees with me  is all  I go to refuge recovery meetings  and I find them much more upbeat  The nice thing is that it is a group for any type of addiction issue people are dealing with  and let's face it  most people have an addiction or attachment to something  or someone   If you like the meeting sober people aspect of AA  RR might be a good alternative  Well done and nice post   Out of curiosity  did you stop the weed    Did it help at all   Though I have not had any in over 30 years I have considered it    I relate to much in your post and really hope I can make a year and beyond   Thanks for posting    I'm on Android  and use an app called pocketcasts  You can find them on iTunes if you're on iphone  There's a lot of recovery podcasts out there  but I've only tried out Recovery Elevator  The format and tone Paul the host has really resonates with me    He releases one per week  and has close to a hundred episodes right now  so there's plenty to listen to in order to keep you occupied   Plus  it's 100  free  I'd have to say if someone went back on the street casue of Kratom it wasn't the Kratom  They have a lot bigger issues  No one is going to steal or sell all their shit including themselves for some kratom it just doesn't happen     I can be cynical or grateful   This has been my biggest lesson I have learned since starting my sobriety   Thanks for sharing it makes a difference     The SUV he t boned was on the side of the road   This is one of the most common multi vehicle accidents for motorcycles   The oncoming car doesn't see the bike coming or assumes the bike is far enough away going slow enough and makes a left turn in front of the rider     "Look twice for motorcycles"   "Ride like you're invisible"  Welcome to the party  pal   The only appropriate response to the Fear is to drink it into submission   Sign me up please  It's a happy New Year  Welcome  Glad you're here  you're not alone  Let's do this sobriety thing together then  See my reply to u dartaga for the podcast details   Still in this  Hard to believe I would make it through the holidays and keep my number going  I feel like I leveled up making it through the holidays and sticking to the change I've been determined to stick to  Closing in on 30 days  Not drinking today  feeling like I am king of my castle  Hold my LaCroix  Im going in  Not drinking today  Went to yoga this morning and I have counseling this afternoon  Going to get some cleaning and quality me time inbetween   I thought getting sober would solve my problems  Then I learned that  I was the problem  Drugs and alcohol were the solution  Take away the solution  and I'm left with myself which is not too comfortable  That being said I stuck with it and learned how to live with new sober self one day at a time  I was able to grow into myself and conquer these problems that I tried to fix with booze  FOR ME  AA taught me how to live   Woke up fresh this morning alcohol free I will not drink today  Are you drinking Nyquil  Because you might as well be doing shots of Jaegermeister if so  I definitely wouldn't call this sobriety  for myself  I continue to smoke cigarettes  so I understand the trading of one addiction clinging to another addiction thing  believe me  But smoking has never made me black out or drive impaired  so for now it's continuing as a crutch  albeit one I'd love to ditch  Best wishes  Happy 100  And great job OP  Sorry  but I also won't be drinking with you today   Tomorrow will be a better day because of it      probably because that's how my dr pronounced it when he pitched it to me   You FUCKING POSEUR    OMG S   What a FUCKING LOSER   Hang in there  man  Almost every one of us have horrible stories that stem from drinking  and everyone I've come across here has been nothing but supportive and kind  Try not to get too down on yourself  friend  Every sober day from now on will get a little better  I won't drink with you today I would say that is not good  but I am no expert   The last time I did cough syrup was in 1993  and I remember getting really fucked up on it     You've got this    Keep that liver happy    Ah  Just very negative  Sorry for being a dip  Going to try and be a bit more active in here this year  Was a big help to me when I initially got clean  Hopefully I can help someone a little  But it will mainly be waffling and rambling  Ha   After been lovely and quiet over the holidays today the gym was heaving with newbies  Hopefully some at least stick around longer than 2 weeks   My sciatica has been playing up today  can't wait to get my scan and a referral onto the pain clinic  Hopefully the cortisone spinal injection will sort me out  I have been on  100mg Gabapentin 3x a day for about a 6 weeks now  Im uncomfortable uping the dose any higher even though I'm on the minimum dose  And i obviously refuse opiates and benzos as a long term pain management strategy  So hopefully the cortisone injection can get me off these meds  Surgery is absolutely the last resort  for many reasons   Took my lad out to the park  It was really frosty so he was saying "look daddy  Jack Frost has been " I told him that in the summer Jack Frost is so busy making ice cream there is no frost  He also learned why we don't jump with both feet onto iced over puddles  Haha  Hes tough though  straight back up and exploring the icy puddle again  Just with one foot this time   Other than that back on a good clean diet and looking forward what 2017 brings         I'd toss it or give it away  I think it'll just make stopping again harder  Just me though you do you I will not take drink today Thank you    Thank you   Thank you   Ya  for sure  Lem  My girl  Smokey be calamari salty this morning  It's just another shit post  god damn  Haha                Takes a thing to get me that riled up  I tell those I sponsor to not try to quit smoking while quittting drinking or drugs  I'm 18 months sober and still smoke  It's my opinion that quitting smoking at the same time as quitting drinking can just make you feel worse  and I have used cigarettes as a crutch to get through the hard days many many times  But I've heard it's easier to quit smoking when quitting drugs and alcohol  so it's up to you  As far as getting rid of The alcohol in your house  that's probably a good idea Glad your hanging in there  You do know it's inevitable that if you continue using that one day whatever you do for work will no longer be an option  Better stop now before that happens    Does the post work pin and nod infront of TV really satisfy  Or just numb  When I was in that position it just numbed  I had no emotions at all  never mind satisfaction  Grey day  5 minute rush  numb  Rinse repeat  Thanks  I really appreciate it    Personally  I do not think I can quit smoking at the same time   I am on Day 2  but still smoking   Smoking does go hand and hand with drinking for me for the most part though   When I drink  easily smoke a ton     When I am not drinking during the week  etc a pack can last me 3 4 days   Best of luck  Really what the fuck could he say  He has no sources or anything anyone to back up his claims   Thanks for this post Mouse  I had a 90 day stretch of sobriety last year along with many stop   starts afterwards  I'm ready to embrace an alcohol free life  looking back to last year when I was not drinking made me realize that I was SO MUCH HAPPIER  Here's to one day at a time  Exactly   I am reading this through tears at work  I don't feel alone in this knowing there are people who have also weathered their way through this  These past few days I have felt like a person who is giving up  who isn't strong enough or doesn't care enough  and who is doing something wrong  Thank you for reminding me I am not   Alright  today I am not drinking  Join me in facing life sober for another day  OK  Timbf  you gotta give me the short version  what the fuck are you guys talking about   Happy New Year   Hope you have a good walk and it can give you some more clarity on this journey we are on   Made it through a pretty tough night last night where I could have drank while playing Pokemon moon and watching Cowboy Bebop but I didn't and I feel great this morning   And I can actually remember what I was doing in Pokemon and how Cowboy Bebop ended  pretty happy about that even if the ending wasn't a happy one  Hey   Great job starting your first step in recognizing and desiring to overcome an addiction   That's fantastic   As the wife of a porn addict  I recommend not making your GF your accountability partner right now   I would ask a close friend to help you through these early steps   It may hurt your GF  and it's possible that telling her will only relieve you of guilt  while leaving her hurt   This isn't very beneficial for one slip   There's a cool program called ever acvountabile for u bucks a month where it sends reports of all your activity to an accountability partner   Realize that porn addiction is often a coping strategy for stress and depression and a lot of other things in life that's negative   It might be helpful to talk to a cognitive behavioral therapy counselor or addiction counselor about your porn addiction  so that they can help you develope positive and beneficial coping strategies to replace porn  Some great suggestions are on here in threads about doing positive activities instead of PMO   Like working out  doing a new hobby  meditating  tai chi  mindfulness  yoga  etc  Please don't get trapped in guilt   You're a human being struggling with addiction  and you were pulled back into it and slipped  but you can begin again  now and do better   It's a wierd balamce to not be so hard on yourself that you are emotional distressed  and use the familiar coping strategy of porn  yet don't be so easy on yourself that you let the addiction lie to you and tell you it's okay to slip again   Just remember  your next slip could be your last  and you could go into a full blown relapse   But don't beat yourself up over it   Sorry if that's unclear or confusing  but I hope this helps  Stay strong   You're still going in the right direction  Fine  I ADMIT IT      I've never shot dope    I've also never drank alcohol and I'm a virgin  The hospital doesn't know me on a first name basis and I have no idea what county jail is like because I've never done anything illegal or bad ever  I just wanna seem hardcore        Hahaha oh I know  Cant wait till  Fash drops in  Fuck the poor schmuck didnt realize who he was trying to BULLY   Like I told him time and again walk away  But no go   Nothing worse than a angry  insecure drunk  I feel the same way   Day 2 and everything seems a little clearer    it's nice to have some positives happen so soon  Right on  That's too bad  What's your new plan  So many good things in this post that I saved it  I was talking about expectations just yesterday  In years past  I always wanted a NYE party that played out like a feel good movie  always wanted a partner to be this way or that  always wanted my efforts to be rewarded exactly the way I envisioned they "should"  and if those things didn't happen  well  then everything was ruined and I was depressed about it  Or some variation of that  How much better life is without expectation  I realized with a new clarity  yesterday that a huge part of being truly present and mindful involves living without expectation  accepting things as they are  Expectations extinguish the opportunity to truly know who I am taking to and truly take in the present  And alcohol exacerbated that   Thank you for sharing your story and insights  You gave me a lot to think about today as well as inspiration and encouragement   I will not drink today Sorry to hear this man but you've got to face the music  Day one is today  Get help  re wire your mindset and get some help  It won be easy and will last the rest of your life but is worth it  Post here and post often  Good luck to ya   Switch to hard drugs   Hahaha you joke   I swear to God I keep expecting him to say "PUNKED"  got ya  u lemarchand put me up to it   But S hes not joking  Sigh  Holy Fuck   Add own pity statement      Thank you for sharing  It sounds like you have a handle on it this time around  I love the idea of printing out your post as a reminder  I don't have a tattoo  but maybe a little wine glass with a big red X through it on my wrist wouldn't be a bad idea as a reminder for when I am tempted  Ha ha  I wonder if anyone has something like that   Maybe have two parts of the tag  longest streak and current streak  That way you have a concrete goal to work towards if you're having trouble starting  to beat your last streak    and if you have a long streak you can still push to get it higher   Nice job  Happy to help  This group is amazing  I've come to so many of the same realizations because of it   3 You will be ok  You're taking all the right steps     This is the hardest part  realizing you have a problem and then taking that first step into Soberland  But you're strong and you can do it  We all believe in you   Don't do too much at once  For example  I am trying to quit drinking but I also really want to lose weight  But I am not putting myself through dieting right now  No way  I have consumed a root beer float every day since I quit drinking  I go through jelly beans and gummy candy and chocolate like it's my job  It's best not to try an conquer too much at once  imo    I won't drink with you today   He doesn't know who he's messing with    Y'all got  r o on lock  but I've been on CA for 6 years    I have a pretty low tolerance for the bullshit by now    Something something die in a fire  Lolol   Thank you   I'm proud of you guys  idk really  Purely anecdotally   when I quit multiplayer games  I noticed that I was starting to enjoy simple things like reading before bed much more  after only a few days or so  Thank you  You'll get there     I realised recently even although I dont drink from the minute my eyes open  I am thinking about it usually to convince myself I won't drink that evening  which changes throughout the day to "i will just have a couple" then depending on how day pans out will result in a 12 pack   I completely identify with this  I've recently realized that I'm now obsessing over  not  drinking   so I'm still thinking about it all the time  and eventually I'd like to actually be totally present   but it's a less destructive and consuming obsession   Add me please   Here's to turning over a new leaf in 2017  I'll eventually post more detailed stuff here  but so far reading through what other people are dealing with has given me great perspective on the situation   Thank you  Here's to your next sober year  Great advice    Yesterday I was in the grocery store  While everyone else appeared to by buying kale and bananas  I was buying chips  gum  sunflower seeds  hot cocoa mix    The concept of relapse is so hazy it doesn't matter  What is important is that you want to steer clear from triggers because it helps you abstain  A radical approach is needed when quitting compulsive behavior  Consider two things  1  The number of days does not mean much in the context of recovery and 2  If you really do everything you can to abstain  it no longer matters what consitutes a relapse  For me gaming is simply something I won't do  and while a relapse is still probable  if I work as much as possible to abstain  the only thing I need to know is that I've radically cut out every ounce of gaming from my life  Absolutely  You have a chance every day to wake up and choose to be better  Maybe this all happened so you could come to this realization  If I hadn't hit my own rock bottom  I certainly never would have quit  As much as it hurt every time I did  I wouldn't change it for anything because it helped me heal and grow  I'm sure later you'll feel the same way   Thank you for responding  it's good to know someone is out there  I do feel pretty alone right now and drinking to blot out boredom and loneliness has always been a problem for me  The anger was just over the top though  Like  jfc have the sense to admit when you're wrong     Wow  Thank you for sharing that   My drinking too was attached to a lot of what I thought I was entitled to a me just saying "fuck it  this makes me happy"  It made me miserable   Congrats on a year    Not sure I totally understand  but I'm definitely sure that the 'old self real me' is exactly what I've been trying to escape  Kratom isn't my first rodeo  I'm 38 now and I've decided I'm not willing to go thru life anymore changing myself because I don't feel like I'm good enough the way I am    I'm about to go back to school to finally work in the medical field  lifelong dream   I wanna pursue my dreams  ya know  Being numbed up on something just makes me stagnant  I wanna feel good because I'm progressing and out there living life   not because I ingested something that gives me a false sense of well being  It's hard  cuz I've been an alcoholic addict on and off for the past 26 years   since I was 12  That's a lot of sitting out on life failing myself and others to shoulder  I have had long term sobriety  the longest being 6 years  Then I got that little voice that said 'u don't need meetings you're fine ' I gave in  Then the next voice was 'u can have a little ' And eventually I gave into that too  I'm really enjoying the 12 step meetings  Those people have gone thru the same feelings and wasted their lives like I have  and it's inspiring to see that they've come back  Makes me think I can make peace with it too  And   if I can see this through  there will be people I meet who are in this same situation and I will be able to give them hope  THAT makes me feel good   Yes  it would be stupid to start smoking again   You are very bored and that is your go to activity   It's only been 1 5 months   My guess is that you may also be scared of what it means to get un bored  getting a job  saving some money  etc   I don't believe getting other drugs for depression is going to help when you're not addressing what's making you depressed   You're bored out of your mind   get un bored  Turtle  I lost my first boyfriend  as an ex  also   We had been broken up for about a year  but we were both still young when his accident happened   That was 10 years ago   This past year without drinking showed me I never fully allowed myself to feel this tragedy and go through the emotions   wth the help of my awesome therapist  I worked through a ton of stuff   The emotions are good     Now we can finally feel without shrouding our feelings with booze  Hello  I'm also one of those new years resolutions suckers  Not my first time trying though  I quit drinking last new years eve and made it 180 days before relapsing on a vacation   During that 180 days I lost 40 pounds and felt incredible  My work ethic improved and my business is now thriving as a result    When I came back from that vacation the vacation didn't end and I've undone almost everything I'd achieved over that 180 day period  I'm now starting off this year behind on work  struggling to catch up  and have re gained all 40 pounds of the weight I'd lost    I commend everyone for making the change but implore you all to stay strong  Every day gets better and better but one slip up can undo it all   This time around I've got some support  I've started attending meetings and will be more active with this sub reddit  this is my first post   I'm confident this year I won't be setting that badge back to zero   Fuck the zero    I will not drink with you today   Yeah  Mom is still visiting so all I hear is how good things were 20 30 50 years ago  I'm actually looking forward getting back to work  I was in the same boat this year   It culminated in a felony dwi and my kids being taken away from me   Will take about a year to get them back    When I drank  I was in this never ending cycle of drunk too high over to drink  It was so dark and so depressing     Through outpatient treatment  aa meetings and therapy  I feel like a different person   And it's only been a few months  I went to my first aa meeting the day the day after I got out of jail   It was the first time in years that I had finally found a little bit of hope   Wasn't much  but enough to keep me sober those first few days  And it just grew from there   I am still going through the court mess and that will be awhile before it is done   But it is so much easier to handle sober   Good luck and if you need anything  please post   there are so many people here to help     EDIT  have you tried calling your local AA intergroup   They usually have a hotline and some will even come to your house to talk to you    Not drinking today  no matter what  The dumb fuck doesnt even know that this is Fash's post thread  From back when it started   Its like Please shut the fuck up and go away  You are CLEARLY not wanted here   But his kind never learn  They lash out and swear till they get their way  But they dont understand its not their way its just the adults have wasted enough time on  the children  So sad really  I agree with all the comments already here  drinking alcohol can be a way to deal with stress  and if I get into a pattern of dealing with life's problems this way then I don't use the tools that I need to when dealing with them  I also don't learn any new ones  When i quit drinking I was a mess  I was full of fear  anger  guilt and incredibly selfish and I had given up my ONLY tool for dealing with stress  I don't know if someone who has never been addicted to anything can appreciate this but it is hell  My answer was not just to quit drinking but as others have said  to deal with my living problems as well or I would have exploded from anger and stress or started drinking again  Like I said looms    can I call you that  better than first name or letter  let  me know  Hes the  type who never admit they are wrong  He made a homophobic comment last night that he deleted  Fucking coward  I called him out on it  So whats he do PM's me with BS and deletes the evidence  instead of manning up Great member eh  Ahhh  Got mL confused with mg  And I'm a science major  Haha  Withdrawals make me dumb  I downvoted my own comment  But in 30 mL of liquid Immodium there are only 4mg of Loperamide which is what I've been taking  If I could moderate  I wouldn't be here   I tried everything to smoke in moderation  but it's just not possible for me on my own   If I have my way  I smoke all day everyday   Unless I am physically unable to smoke  I do not possess the ability to moderate   The difference between "normal" smokers and drinkers  and those with substance abuse problems  is just that   The obsession and compulsion to smoke and drink   I read an article once  top ten signs you are an alcoholic  number 1 is   you read articles called top ten signs     Long story short  in my experience  if you are here  and having a problem  odds are not good that you can moderate   Maybe you can  if you figure it out  let us know  but this sub is really for people who want to quit  not slow down I wasted yesterday and don't want to feel that way again    I am excited with you and certainly won't be drinking with you    When I was a teenager I wasnt comfortable with a therapist   I was almost in the exact same situation as you  alcoholic mom  supportive dad  My dad was the one who convinced me to go and it was the best decision for me at that time    Right now you have a tremendous amount of stress out upon you  You need to think proactively and consider not just how you feel at this moment but how you'll feel in a few years  You also might want to seek out an Al Anon Teen group  You can look them up online and it would put you in a group of your peers who are in the same situation    You sound like a responsible kid  Keep your chin up and remember you are only responsible for yourself not her  I did that too   That is part of the reason aa was so helpful for me   Not only did it keep me from drinking  but I made friends too    May I ask how you quit  Cold turkey  patch etc  I'm thinking of doing the same   You're freakin awesome  Thanks for being inspiring and telling it like it is and being a leader   Fantastic   "You are a gentleman and a scholar"    I've never read Carr's book  but it sounds interesting   Another book of note is "This Naked Mind" by Annie Grace  NICE JOB   HIGH FIVES    Checking in  I feel embarrassed to write this as it's only day two of the challenge  but accountability is important so here goes  I woke up this morning and was browsing through Instagram  bad habit   when I stumbled across a page full of scantily clad models  It wasn't porn and I didn't explicitly seek it out  but I still felt myself starting to get aroused by pixels on a screen  which is not good  Although I left the page pretty quickly and wasn't really tempted to act out  it's still a definite red flag that I need to pay attention to   Especially since I've had issues with triggering content on Instagram in the past  as I'm sure many of us have   Since I use it to help promote my business  I don't want to uninstall Instagram if I can avoid it  But I definitely need to set some boundries as to how I use it  and hold myself to them  And if this sort of thing happens again  Instagram is gone  simple as that  Because my recovery is more important than any stupid social media platform  Anyway  rant over  Have a great week everyone  Great  I'm normally a good writer but when I write here  it's always dry and confused  I reread myself and think "fuck it  I can't do better" and hit submit   Your writing is really good  there's something in the way you wrote things that people wrote a million times before  You made it sound good and funny and appealing  Kudos for the Louis CK reference  my favorite comedian who say things we all feel in a completely honest  brutal and funny way  I know we're not here to talk about writing style but I wanted to point that out   I think my problem with writing here is that I want to say too much and I end up repeating  just as I'm doing right now    Good writing and happy to see you fought your struggles  I will not drink today  I feel like I had three freebie days because I was busy on vacation with friends  Today  which is only the second day of the year  is where it gets tough  Alone time is not good for me   But so far I'm restraining  Very nice   Congratulations and thanks for your posts and insight  I have heard exercise helps with anxiety  maybe try doing a few push ups or sit ups  Sorry wish I had better advise  Weed was causing my anxiety  it's not fun     Just wanted to say I am in the same boat as you  my husband is a daily toker and isn't quitting  I know it will make things harder  But I feel stronger and more resolved knowing I can stop even when it's so accessible  It's a harder road but will be more rewarding in the end       Yeah I understand  I need an actual number as my goal of days  A detox in a sense I guess  I somehow managed to get in the habit of drinking literally every single night for the last 4 months  I dunno what happened but I know I need to break that habit  Sign me up  Kid  props to you for managing to not only blend in with one addict sub  but mod one as well    It takes effort    I mean you don't know shit about shit  but you went far  Yay    Good for you  how exciting  I didn't buy enough yarn at first either    now I have too much ahahah  But I just started cross stitching sooooo hahaha on to the next craft   D And I agree  these crafts are SO cathartic and help with my anxiety so much  I'm tapering so I don't have serious RLS right now  But I am experiencing its cousin   the obnoxious achy legs  RLS was a huge PITA in my past opiate detoxes  I tried quite a few things  I think the clonidine works best for me   the supplements and stuff didn't seem to work  but I don't know if it woulda been even worse without em  ya know    Yesterday  my legs were really getting to me  I forced myself to do the treadclimber and it seemed to help significantly  I didn't even do that much  cuz I just did a big Kratom drop and it's soooo hard to exercise  I mean  GEEZ  Lol    Caffeine does make my legs worse  but I still drink it  When I've done c t and had the massive anxiety  I absolutely could not have any caffeine  Like a sip would send me into a crazy panic  burning skin  etc    In the past  RLS and aching legs were my worst and longest lasting symptoms and drove me nuts  Tapering down on the Kratom and getting the leg thing back really scared me  I thought this was not an opiate  It was like caffeine  Oh well  Point is that it goes away eventually   Yeah  at the end of the day if you love multiplayer games  then it's your life and you should go for whatever you like    But for me  I still prefer not going back into competitive mode and playing for a better rank 10 hours a day since I lack self control to stop after 1 game  Watching shows on Netflix can be paused  there's no special skin or achievement that I am able to unlock and it feels way more causal to me than a Dota match  For me it's a lot about the addiction that's made me stop  I  too  am confused  Sign me up please   I am excited with you     Let's do this  I needed the face to face support of AA to stop  In my area there are tons of great meetings  with awesome people who are eager to help out and teach me how to stay sober   Online helps too  but I wouldn't be here without face to face human connection  You can do this  Hell yeah  man  Glad you are here  I relapsed so many times after going to an AA meeting  because I kept thinking  "I'm nowhere near as bad as that guy " I too had to listen to the similarities  and not the differences  and now I really enjoy going to certain meetings  Glad you don't have to dig any deeper  Those things  not losing a job  etc     are called the "yets " I haven't lost my job   Yet  I haven't been arrested   Yet  I haven't gotten a DUI  even though I drove drunk a million times    yet   Welcome back on the wagon   I will not drink with you today    I took a lot of short naps  drank a lot of club soda  took short walks  read non stop on SD  and told myself that it was okay to feel like crap taking it as a sign of just how addicted I was   I'd read enough to know that the physical withdrawal eventually subsides bit by bit  3 7 days for me    Lastly  I chose to see my discomfort at the dues I was happy to pay in exchange for leaving my drinking days behind   It's undoubtedly the hardest thing I've done in a very long time  but quite possibly the best as well   Good luck   You can do this  Nice  keep it up   You should be "normal" by tomorrow  though we forget normal means having emotions and stuff  I have had a look and theres one in my area tomorrow and Wednesday  neither seem to have childcare but on Wednesday kids at their dads which is a dangerous time for me so I am going to make sure I go and until then keep my mind occupied on here and other useful sites people suggested  Thanks for encouragement  same back to you   Buddy there is no SHORT  version  Check my profile and Fash's and see noob call Fash a twat a cunt and many others  And the shit he said about me  Holy Fuck Tuna  I was in the EXACT same boat one month ago  It only took a week before I was back to daily  After about 2 wks of daily use  I was worse than before and developing all sorts of terrible health issues  My thyroid has swelled and I feel like total shit  Today is Day 1 of CT and I reaaaallly hope I learned my lesson this time  If people like us could moderate their usage  we would have done it a long time ago  Even after this last go around  I still can't seem to get idea in my head that I need to totally let go and dump my stash  I worry about an eventual ban and that I'll "never be able to get it again"  I want to have a stash around for "rainy days" in the future  years down the road  but I just don't know if I can  should  It's so easy to get on a slippery slope even just using once  If you are like me and can't seem to toss your stash  I would suggest getting a time lock safe  I've started using one and it works but sometimes I wonder if I'm not just needlessly torturing myself  One thing is for sure though  if I have bags just sitting around not locked up  there is no way I have the self control to quit   Thanks man   I'm trying very hard   The worst part is  my family thinks there's something horribly wrong with me  since I never work our go out    I think the hardest part is getting out of bed in the morning   Ughhhh this is the most difficult thing I've ever done  but I threw away my kratom  and I'm fully committed to this   One day at a time  Where are you originally from  I've heard that Switzerland is one of the hardest countries in the world to move into   Got it thanks  And yes lets  I want to change so badly  I think these things are a "blessing in disguise" to make us grateful to be sober  You'll be ok  not drinking with you today   Terrible advice  He claimes Fash and I are poser Junkies and we dont know WTF we are talking about  Like Junkies are a grwat lifestyle eh Tuna It really worked out stellar   And apparently they have my shoes   I just have to go trade them for the slippers  Yeah I figured there was no certain answer to this  It probably varies between people too  I guess I'll just have to wait and find out  I hear you  I guess it's all about that thing I'm no good at  moderation  Great thoughts   Thanks for that  Awesome   Keep checking in here   As you can see  lots of info  support   success here on SD  Has resulted in my longest sobriety run ever   Most importantly  It is not killing me  though the first few days were challenging   Won't be drinking with you today  Thank you  I'm with you all the way   I have almost zero motivation as well   But I'm convinced there's light at the end of the tunnel   Hang in there  buddy  Good on you  Sounds like you're off to a great start already    We are still WAITING on that apology  Thats all you gotta do in CA  Make it easy bud  I've taken Adderall off and on since childhood  I'm a total addict  but oddly enough  I never abused it  It didn't tickle my brain correctly or something  I remember having some after I quit morphine and a couple weeks into detox I tried it cuz I was sooo sluggish  Somehow  it gave me anxiety but no energy  Definitely did not help and I didn't do it again    The crippling fatigue seems insurmountable  The only thing that has ever helped me is exercising  But I laugh when I read people advising exercise to people who just did a c t detox  How is it even possible  I remember 'exercising' to me meant a lap down the hall and back  Then I worked up to two  three  etc  it helped a lot tho   Lol  that kid has been playing everyone    You can try this at home  you don't need to be a junkie     Get a big spoon    Try dissolving shit in it    Salt  sugar  powdered sugar  baking soda  it doesn't matter     Waste your drugs here if you want to     We add heat because it aids this process     Every junkie knows this    They're frauds if they don't get this    You quickly notice your dope not dissolving    Only someone who has never done it before would claim otherwise    But don't believe me  try it out     I appreciate you like them  I did too  but they're full of shit    http   i imgur com 3A5eTzV jpg      look at all that not dissolving    Nobody who actually does this garbage is so stupid as to think you don't heat this up    They're fakes  "this guy can no longer choose to make today a better day" What an amazing  sobering  and empowering statement  Congrats for making the right choice  I know it is hard  and there will be tough days coming  but remember that YOU are tough  Tougher than the cravings  Tougher than the excuses  You are GOING TO MAKE IT  Keep checking in here when you feel the urge  Read others stories  See that you are not alone  We support you  Soon  you will be in a position to help others that are at the same point as you are today  Good luck  my friend   Not the only one  Thank who shall not be named for this  Do I need to pull up your PMs again  chief  It has been extreme lately   Kids must be on break from school  This is good advice  I'd recommend joining a starter course of something you'd like to do and talk to people there  I personally found climbing and dancing worked really well for this  especially climbing   Do it for your own enjoyment and just to get out there and be around people    I have seen people who were sober for 18 years go back out   The reason one particular person admitted to was that they stopped working on their sobriety  I am here  it is the new year   I believe the phrase is  bring it on  Thanks for this  as a newbie its really good to have people who've gone through it reinforce that even if it's not easy  it's worth it  Quit porn   Keep masturbating as long as it's not creating problems   If it is  cut back or you can just have sex only and not masturbate  It's really a personal preference about masturbation   Personally  i was a frequent masturbator and it affected my motivation and mood negatively   If this happens to you  you may want to adjust to less or none   It just depends on your preference    Porn is damaging on so many levels to both men and women  and damaging to relationships   Educate yourself on this  and you will see it has far more problems and negatives than positives   Google "negative impact of porn" and "porn brain changes"    Good luck young man   You're very astute to be asking these questions at such a young age   Props  Same  I don't want to have another year tainted by drug use  I was getting there last year  but this is my chance to build a new life for myself  and to keep drugs  and alcohol  away from it so that I can make something truly good out life    You can do this  I think  u dd4y's suggestion of making a proper action plan is a really good idea  I think I'm gonna have a go at doing that too   Keep us updated  Let's do this thayng I'm hanging in there  Trying to be satisfied with the progress I've made and not so laser focused on the end result  I'm just about functioning  Perfect way to describe it  This may take me three months  but who cares  I already feel way different and my hair quit falling out and my skin cleared up  I feel cleaner   I'm sorry  I've been in an obsessive place like this and I remember it well  It helps me in times like that to try and not be so hard on myself    the obsession is humiliating  particularly in how others interact with it  It's a powerful set of feelings  but it's only a set of feelings  a condition that will pass  Obsession is a burden I carry  and when I'm ready to set it down  I'll set it down   Amen  I heartily concur with your assessment that leaving alcohol behind is job  1 in these early days   I made the mistake of taking on too much at the same time I was trying to embrace sobriety   It set me up for disappointment and a number of relapses in 2016   What's different this time around is keeping my focus on not drinking  and taking small bites on the other things in my life   Also  I have a support system this time around  SD and a counselor   Great advice  Lol what  Homophobic comment    And yes calling me that is fine  most people have figured out who I am  Preferably don't add the y though because it's too easy to search for that   Thank you  24 hours in and already pulling my hair out  Just eyed up a bottle of wine downstairs for about 5 minutes  but I'm standing strong  Fuck this shit  I ain't doing it anymore  This group seems awesome  Thanks again man  That's awesome  Your skin looks great   Thats my greatest fear  losing the kids  and I can feel it getting closer with each day I drink  What I've realised is Im already losing them as I prefer to spend my evenings drinking rather than sitting with them  or if I read to my son I will have a beer on the bedside table  Its a awful existence  Well done for turning your life around and for taking the time to offer me support with all you are going through yourself   Life Ring is a group that I go to and have been pretty happy with   I go to AA groups and I get some of the things you are saying   The biggest positive takeaway from AA is hearing the other stories and gaining strength in my own recovery from that   The most difficult in staying sober for me is the feeling of isolation through the process  wow  ya  that seems extra ridiculous  Like  what  Who would try to be a poser about junk  What does that get you   Got my first DUI at age 31 38 days ago  notice badge    The first 2 3 days I thought my life was over  complete hell   Blew a  25 and drove away after a side swiped another vehicle  got charged with that too     Luckily I didn't kill or injure anyone   After those few days  I decided I refuse to let alcohol ruin my life anymore  I came on this sub right away and mostly just read  I stated going to AA and a counselor and couldn't be more at peace with my life rt now   Both of those were life changers for me    Even with all the legal shit  I have more hope  faith and positivity in my life than I ever had   We can all have new life if we choose too   You are 24  you can move on  it'll be ok   Keep your head up  it only gets better I promise   Best of luck   I tried AA once and found nothing in it for me  That was my individual experience    I thought I would never find a way out of the drinking cycle until I came across the book  The 30 Day Sobriety Solution   I talk a lot about that book on this sub  but I do not have any affiliation with it   other than it may have saved my life when willpower  AA  and self loathing couldn't   Amazing post   Thank you for the story   the inspiration   and the laughs    welcome Love this  Congratulations  Now I have paper cuts    From what I've heard TNM is a more modern  actionable and user friendly version of Carr's book  I have read TNM twice but have yet to read Carr's  I will  eventually  but for now I'm just going on what I've heard   Congrats on the clean time  man  That's great to hear   How you feeling    I find mindfulness pretty difficult to get into  but I'm gonna give it another proper shot  And maybe get into a Martial Art in the coming months   I've always wanted to  but I've just realized  if I can throw away so much time on acquiring  taking  and recovering from drugs  I can sure as hell make time for a new hobby that's gonna help me better myself   Best of luck  And welcome welcome      Take one thing at a time   Congratulations   A hell of an accomplishment    As someone who First Nations I take GREAT OFFENSE to that slur  Fuck man Gays  now  First Nations people  Fuck you  Right  I mean  I know I shouldn't complain  My family is pretty cool  but damn  these conversations are just so fucking boring  And it is so hard to put the mask on and pretend I'm a real person              I can do it  like  at work and shit  but at work I am getting paid  If you want me to pretend to be functional  you need to pay me  is my philosophy   Yeah   People offer me a beer and I decline   I don't like drinking "a beer"   My mind doesn't work that way  I had never heard of "wet brain" before surprisingly  That is not just scary but terrifying  Right up there with ALS  Wow    Another reason I am glad I quit  Not today Damn  that sucks  But you've been hear long enough to know we get ass hats sometimes  Just brush it off  you know that both you and Fash are loved  Wouldn't worry about some random idiot  When you have broken that trust  it's difficult to regain that trust and they were most likely using that as a tool to do so  Although  OP should do research  instant drug tests are  not 100  accurate  I have failed several for no reason  then proved clean by lab testing  Congrats on 1 year   Looks like you have made progress on many real life achievements over that year  Keep up the good work brother  ding ding ding  And dont forget the 3 5 hours on site everyday Fash and I do   Just because you know we wanna be cool  good luck i'm on day 2 also    Hell  you're lucky  That's about what I spent from the middle of November to New Years Day last year  Had my head buried so far in the sand I would ignore how much I was spending  Good on you for recognizing this   Posts like yours help me since it makes me think about how bad I was just over 9 short months ago   I was a miserable drunk and pill addict who often considered suicide   Help for me was a stint in rehab  then an intensive outpatient program and an AA meeting each and every day   There are people that care for you and want to see you get better   Please keep reading and posting here so we can see how you are doing  Take it easy at the gym  Don't exacerbate your cold         Day 6 is better than Day  1  All the physical shit will be dwindling down  Take notice of the symptoms that are going away    I always produced an ungodly amount of spit when detoxing  Fuck that sucked so bad    All the weird anxiety is totally normal  this you know   It's a new year  New start  Good stuff  Xo The guilt and shame can be crippling at first  They were for me  I completely understand how you're feeling  but don't let them win  I promise after you detox for a bit and find sobriety  you will start to see the beauty of it and your guilt and shame will be much more manageable  I am SO incredibly sorry you're feeling this way  I go to therapy and AA when I need to  and I strongly suggest you do the same  Without therapy  I don't know how I would have managed my guilt and shame  Wishing you all the best in your journey to sobriety   3  Hey there 2017  Didn't drink to celebrate  Not drinking today  Intend not to drink in the future  Good luck everyone  Edit to correct autocorrect   It's gonna get better  It's not always easy to stay away from it  but each time you win against that voice or that part of you that's craving for speed and trying to lure you into using  you feel so much stronger  You can do this    You can find a better way to live that doesn't lead to you feeling like total crap every few days after crashing   sign me up please  Lets do this  Totally appropriate  I tried NA beer when I was in my I can cut down on booze phase  I didn't really like it   Now it would be too close to the real thing  if I'm gonna drink I want to get fucked up  not just reminded of it   I do miss beer with yard work  house cleaning  and rainy days but those occasions called for specific beers and NA beer won't do    If I was at a bar and needed to hold and drink something I'd probably go with soda water but if I drank an NA beer I would not be upset with myself or reset my sobriety app    If it works as a crutch go for it  if it is just a stepping stone back to boozing it's probably a bad idea  I would never flush weed down the toilet cuz im against wasting stuff but that really shows you are determined to quit  GL  also running is really good  gives you nice natural high if you do it long enough  it is an awesome feeling  especially when you just wake up  dress up and go for a run followed by a cup of coffee  it is amazing start of a day Yesterday homophobe  Now this morning Racist  As a First Nation's person he seems to get great joy in calling me Chief  Like I told him  That is also a slur  Not drinking alcohol today  no matter what I am faced with    You're right  I thought of that later after posting  I just need to stay strong enough to always come to the conclusion that I'm making the right choice to stay sober  I have GAD  PTSD  and ADHD
