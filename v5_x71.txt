Fuck the other sub  you are here now  Already in 2017    What is 14 months  it's going to get better  If you cant get rid of your thought  keep them  Promise me though you will stay alive for a bit longer than February  Don't give up on drawing  Actually  think of it as some motivation to keep your life going   to get better at something  I promise you  I was very very bad when i started drawing  I look back at some of the stuff and cringe  But now I  love to draw and while i know it's not perfect  i keep striving to do better  It makes me happy and i think it could make you happy too  Start by drawing some of your favorite video game or manga characters  and instead of berating it  find the little flaws and figure out how you could fix them  and you'll be improving in no time   There are many other ways to create things as well  Some people are good with air dry clay  others love to make music  some like to sew  etc    I'm not having suicidal thoughts at the moment  but have been the past month or so  My boyfriend has lymphoma and it's been making me feel quite depressed  It's easier said than done  but you just gotta remind yourself of the things in life that you DO love  Relaxing  drawing  anime  and video games make you happy  maybe if only for a while  but you have to latch on to things like that   Please  please please don't decide to end your life  I know you may not think so  but from the short conversation we've had so far  i can tell that you're quite smart and lovely with deep interests  All you have to do is find some tiny bit of motivation inside you to keep going  Being social is hard  I know first hand  But it becomes a lot easier when you find people who share the same interests as you  whether it be online or in real life   It's just something you have to take day by day  You mentioned you have one friend   ask them if they want to go window shopping one day  Ask them if they'd like to go out to eat  During depressive episodes  sometimes i'll just lay in my pajamas all day and stay in bed because it's what i think is best for me  But it's not what's best for me   I started going to concerts alone  and I can think of 4 people in the past 6 months that I've made acquaintances with  and one really great friend  Meeting others in real life is spontaneous and unexpected  so don't think that life will be like this forever  You will get to know someone and i bet you there are plenty of people who would love to be your friend  I really mean it  Hey  I'm here  My name's Abby  Taking solance in food is a bad idea anyways  I think there is a pretty much of a chance to star things over  now it's a good time  Are there tihngs that could impede you form doing so  In a weird way it makes me feel better  people here can understand what I'm feeling  I might have gone through with it by now otherwise  Why are you in pain  Do such episodes last for long usually  That's very good that you are scare so you will not do anything that couldn't be undone  Just a few days and you will be back to normal again  How about a conversation with somebody and maybe there will be no need for spending any money casue there will be no reason  I'm sorry   If you were from australia you would be old enough to live by yourself  get a job and start saving  2017 will be your year to free yourself from the bullshit  WE are only human beings  we are vulnerable and sometimes we thing we are stupid  We are meant to be that way  no need to beat you up becasue of that  "I am an Entrepreneur and when we have a product that has defects  we simply discard it  especially if its a kind of defect that cannot be corrected  I see this decision of mine as something similar to that   I am a defected product  trying to fix something that I guess can't be fixed  "   I relate to that Shame about the pet  but what's important to do is focus on small achievable goals to get to a point where you're satisfied with your life  Like  for example  try waking up early and making yourself breakfast  This might seem like a small trivial thing  but isn't everything  Maybe once you see that you can do things then you can start to make more and more goals  And since you've found reddit  I trust you know your way around the internet well enough to get help and support when you need it   Could we keep this convo here  Go sleep  you could use it for sure  tomorrow you are going to wake up and i'm sure you will feel better I hope you have a good new year too  You are right  if you surrender now you will never know what you might miss  There will be good things  and not so good things  Yes  the new things will be met by you  but there is a chance that you could make a new friend or two  Nobody can tell us exactly what is going to happen  But the chance that it will be good is always there   I'm curious  Which country do you live in and what is making it fall apart   Clearly killing yourself isn't going to solve your families problems  If not make it harder for your wife  Can you imagine having your child grow up without a dad  How your wife will have to tell her child one day that life was too hard to handle and that he chose his way out  I hope you live on my man  It's always a moment of pain for a life of glory and you're clearly going through that pain stage   How come  There earth hAs been around for billions of years and i respect your thinking but focusingg on the positives is always the best way up  The world is becoming greener everyday  And global emmisions are going down every year  Can you elaborate  So you will just kill yourself and let that "sick society" win   You still have some land to buy one day  If you have turned off ur phone and deactivated ur social media surely that shows that someone cares about you and hopes you wake up I feel that by you coming here and writing this post  which really must have been a difficult thing to do  that despite how awful you feel  and justifiably so  that you still have some semblance of hope left  despite how small it may be   You speak about your child with love  that you want to be there for her  that you want to be a good father  Am I right to think this  Because of you can absolutely do this  It may not be easy  but it's certainly achievable   You comment about 'being past the point of saving' jumped out at me quite a bit  mostly because I can really empathise with this thought process  Everyday you see things stay the same  sometimes get worse  and any hope you have of wrestling back control of your life seems to dwindle  It can be a very vicious cycle  Can I ask what you do to fill your days  I often found that just finding a little purpose each day can help  definitely not make everything better  but begin down that path   I really do hope attempt to take the steps to recovery  the fact you have gone to therapist's  and meetings tells me you're strong  as getting help for such a difficult problem is an extremely brave thing to do  I'd would be happy to talk further if you like    What is going on  What happened  Can you elaborate on the things that are making you hate your life  No  because I had a s o  before I started cutting but then they broke up with me  a few months later I started cutting out of depression  as they say  one sometimes has to work hard to make their dreams come true  I know how you feel  Sometimes I think it's faded but really it hasent  People only seem to notice me if I start acting erratic  My parents want perfect children unfortunately they got two very unhappy ones  I'm sure it will get better at some point but I'm just waiting for when  So hang in there it will get better  And I'm sure people notice you but you have to notice them too   Still not a  reason to take your life I want to be a good father you are right but these thoughts I just can't get ride of them and I've been planning this last overdose for a while I know I should get help but I just can't I was actually going to kill myself two days ago but the shoppers got my meds mixed up and I could only get 7 pills at the time the 7 pills I hid away that's why I have 9 days to go until I can get a refill and my days are filled with a co op because when I was younger I dropped out of school because I was so lonely I couldn't stand to be around people not in the sense I hated them but because I would see them laughing and having a good time being normal but anyways I fill my days with co op and going for drives basically blasting music as well  this is a really rough and stressful time of the year  but i'm trying to look at the new year as a fresh start  we made it through 2016  and i feel like that's an accomplishment in and of itself  i hope you're okay op    i know it's not much and i wish i could offer more  but i'm always here if you need to talk  Plan  you have a plan  Give yourself a chance to realize it  Okay  What people  Lots of chronic physical health problems  I take medication daily but I'm now developing intolerances to the medication so I can no longer control the pain  I'm also sick of my tinnitus  It's been getting louder for a while now and I can't cope with it  I absolutely agree with what you said and you are 100  correct on it  For people who want to date  meet girls etc India is absofucking shithole  unless you compare to middle east camelfuckers   I was exactly where you were around a decade ago and I saw no light but I was not depressed  I was angry  Angry with the cards dealt to me and I rabidly did everything possible to get out and I hopped countries and am settled in US  Once here I went crazy going to parties  meeting girls  dating them  fucking them and in the end realized that all of it is meaningless  All you need are good friends and a comfortable life   You have a head start to me  You are very very young  Not even finished high school  I would give my arm to be in your situation  Don't let your hopes fade away  You have a very brilliant chance of making it out of India and making it out as its much easier now than 10 years ago   Drop me a message if you need any guidance or help   I feel so sorry for you  I myself have chronic back pain  and it's killing me  And you still have that tinnitus on top of everything  What do the doctors say  Hey  come back here Would you like to message me  I can't say I know what you've been through  but I'd like to learn more about your situation  maybe offer some advice if I feel qualified for it  You are young  you still have a life ahead of you  Even if you think that now everything sucks balls  it will get better  Send me a message if you need someone to talk to   You should seek therapy  if you aren't in it already  Ask your father or your guidance counselor at school about setting it up for you    You pay someone to sit and be there for you every week  without fail  It may seem awkward and stupid at first  but over time you will appreciate having someone who knows you and sees you for who you really are  With the right therapist  you can feel like you're "really here" and finally gain some acceptance grieve for your sister  Maybe you or your dad could have found her earlier and stopped her  but if she was really determined she would have just tried again  Because you can't control anybody  I know what it feels like to be let down by the whole world and to feel like you're all alone  happens to me pretty often actually  but the truth is you aren't  and you know this  Make some changes in your life  throw out the trash and cling to the good  Work on yourself  If you're still miserable every single minute  then  well  you can do whatever you want  We'll never know if your sister would have smiled again  though  since she did what she did   Why do you think there is no room for you  wow  i can't even imagine how strong you must be to have made it this far already  that's more than anybody should have to deal with  i'm really not sure what to say  other than sorry  i really hope you can find the support you need and can get through this  you're still so young i feel almost the opposite sometimes    this sub  along with  r depression has made me realize just how many of us are struggling with similar issues and miserable lives  people that don't have depression or suicidal thoughts really can't relate at all Can you explain  I can't promise anything my pain has exceeded the resources for coping with pain  I cant anymore  its too painful  if you love someone more than you love yourself you'll understand   hey man    i won't be online long but just wanted to say hey and happy new year  hope you're doing alright  hang in there What have you been doing  It's because I'm a terrible person  According to whom  What happened   and there is plenty of room for bad people in this world so i bet it's not your case According to everyone irl   Just because you're alone  broke and unemployed doesn't make you scum  unless you drown puppies or traffic people or something  I don't know the situation with you and your family and friends but just because you're estranged doesn't necessarily mean that they don't care about you  even if it's only just a smidge     I'm not going to tell you what you should or shouldn't do  just to think about the gravitas of what you're planning to do because its not reversible  I'm sorry you're in such a shitty place right now    you know it's our generation who raised those young people   And there is still plenty of people in this world that are not like that  The world is as sick as it always has been  but now the information travels faster  Not everyone  not according to me  it's what we do  HNE from Canada    still got 7 hours to go until midnight here  hope things get better for you Darling  do you have any disorders  Also  have you taken anything  Hey  friend  I'm sorry that this person in your life is bringing you so much pain and sadness  Have you talked to your grandma about how her reactions are affecting you  I understand that it isn't something that she can turn off  any more than you can turn off your depression  but it might be something that you can figure out together  Okay  How much  I dont think mods realize  that people here are the only ones we can talk with    sometimes we just need to say what is on our mind but we cant because we can get banned  I don't get people who laugh at others for not knowing something  We're all human  nobody can possibly know everything  Don't ever think that you should be good at something only because people expect you to be good at it  Maybe you haven't found the right social circle for yourself  Some people are narrow minded and judgmental but that's not the case for everyone  I was just wondering what was considered "legitimate selfharm" Kind of like r hazard0usstupidity mentioned    no one has ever mentioned the nails thing  I used to purposely give myself ingrown nails and it was a mess    That was probably more dangerous than some of my milder forms of self harm  Hm    I really don't want to get into that  It's not relevant to this sub  I only mentioned it because it contributes to the depth of my depression  Hi    I'm new to this too  as of 10 or so minutes ago  and you have caught my attention  I'm 27 and am one of the handful of people you mentioned earlier   I know exactly what you mean about EVERYTHING  except I'm not a graphic designer  although I almost pursued that career ironically  I'm in the same boat as you and your thoughts and Id like to see if we could help each other out  I feel we would be able to relate to each other more than anyone else here  I am praying and hoping for you  Please don't give up  Little steps at a time   Okay  Can you tell me what you meant by "ghosts"  I tried very hard to see it that way  too  I've just been hammered by misfortune this year and every time I get my hopes up  two more things go wrong  It's a combination of lousy circumstances and having a mood disorder  Ugh  Thank you for being so compassionate  though  I appreciate it  Okay  Have you ever seen things before that weren't there  or heard things that weren't there  What a joke  I'm eating a gun tonight   I read your other post about how you want to kill yourself and I think that you might be helped by talking with an online therapist right now   People who will talk to you immediately and you can work through your feelings   Sibly is an app that is only available for iPads and iPhones but it worked really well for me   It is free for the first week or month  I can't remember  but the point is that you can talk to someone immediately   There's also Lifeline Crisis Chat and Blah Therapy   You deserve to be listened to  and I agree with you about taking care of yourself first   So many people will try to take advantage of you in life and you are better off when you can figure out quickly who is trying to help you and who wants to harm you   Stay away from the bullshit as much as you can   I know it's hard  but these feelings and thoughts  are  by definition  temporary and you will feel better  you just have to be patient with yourself  Okay  So you know that they aren't real  Why i posted this I'm not sure  Gonna have one last call with surmaitians and go from their But do you find it's led to anything different  Like you started because of depression but do you think that maybe it's led to you cutting yourself because of other emotions  no problem  take care of yourself and try to have a good night   new years  we're all in this together  Glad to hear you are moving on from self harm  Accepting that you need help is hard and you can be proud of yourself for doing so   Best wishes  A lot of us can't explain why we really do it   Some do it for attention  to show others how they feel   Some like what you described  feeling something  pain  during a time when you feel empty or depressed or just nothing at all   There are many other reasons why people cut themselves    We can't tell you why your gf does it  but I'm sure you can find out by asking her the right questions  This is a common issue for cutters  Sometimes you have to ask them the right questions or they won't even find out certain things about themselves   Hope that makes sense im drunk sorry   Best wishes for your struggling girlfriend and you  I think that it comes down to the basis of our societies  Everyone has the right to live with equal rights  to express themselves freely and to get help when they need it   We all deserve it   I'm going to be 100  honest  suicide is tricky because those who suffer a lot don't feel like they could live a better life and they feel like it's better to end it  It's not a reasonable decision  They would continue on living if they weren't as much emotionally overwhelmed  With that being said     What's happening in your life to make you think of suicide  I'm in 2017 already and it indeed seems better  be strong  I would definitely encourage you being open and honest with her   open communication is key to any relationship   You're so welcome  Any time  friend  Of course  do you have anything specific you're asking  Or just my personal experiences Life is sometimes a struggle for me   too  all the ways of ending it are super tempting  but then I think of  what if I fail      Just wanted to let you know that you're not alone in this particular struggle    This is not the subreddit for providing suicide ideas  sorry  it's forbidden in the rules   You could just fap and make dank memes  What war  man  Iraq  that sounds like a bad situation to be in  sorry about ur sister  Dont blame yourself tho  she was probably going through something in school maybe getting made fun of or something u had no way of knowing  Do u have any real friends you can talk to about how ur feeling  or any relatives  you sound like u need someone  It's as simple as resource management at the most basic level   From the minute you are born until the minute you die  you are benefiting from society in some way  Do you use the roads  Did you attend school  Have you ever used public health care in any capacity  If so  taxpayers have contributed to your existence in some capacity  Therefore  there's a vested interest in ensuring that you live long enough to contribute back to the "pool" of resources   There's also empathy  human decency  etc  but at a strictly cost benefit ratio  if people start killing themselves without contributing to society on a regular basis  then  everyone  loses   Happiness is so subjective and spontaneous  I would always listen to someone's rationale for suicide before talking them down  As shitty and horrible as it sounds  some people  IMO  would be better off pulling the trigger  see  patient with a terminal  painful illness  so I would never try to tell them to keep fighting  etc etc   In your case  and I'm basing this solely on your language and perceived tone so I could be wrong  you are too young to off yourself  Choices of words like "I don't deserve to be here"  and "I'm not happy living"  to me  suggest some sort of internalized burden  My advice and encouragement to you is to find a form of repentance that will allow you to forgive whatever it is you feel has removed your "right" to be here  For me personally  I find philanthropy to be truly humbling  Give it a whirl sometime  see if it changes your philosophy  I really wish I had somebody who would do that with me  It sounds really hot  Initially  therapy is usually your best bet  But you have to be able to make it clear that while you could kill yourself  you're not going to  Which also means you have to have an obligation to yourself not to kill yourself until then  I'm in the same boat  and it's 7 weeks until my first appointment  Maybe we can use each other for support  Work together to get through the next two month so we both can make it to getting some help  Hey  you can still turn back  Its not too late  We can talk about what's been going on if you would like  Kind of you to say  but you don't know OP so you can't accurately judge his character  You're probably a good person though  We do realise  and we try to make sure our enforcement reflects that knowledge   We're not perfect and we do the best we can   If you can suggest changes to the rules or policies that would make things better for you  we're totally receptive to that    You don't understand what I've lost  I've lost everything  I've lost the gift of life  I've always had it but never realised it was there  just to look at someone and talk to them  I can't adjust in this society anymore I feel like a monster  I'm 21  I used to be normal 8 months ago  I used to have a normal life  I used to have friends  I used to be able to talk to another human being without making them feel uncomfortable  now I can't even walk in the same street as someone passing by  I've stolen my future  I've stolen my freedom  I've stolen everything  Now things aren't the same anymore  my reality isn't the same anymore  I've fucked up so bad  I can't be in the same room as the people that were in my life before  I can't even be in the same room with anyone anymore because all it took to ruin my life was me  a drug and a room  There are many signs that tell me I should kill myself  there are little signs that tell me I shouldn't   I think I know what you mean  Do you have an idea why feel like that  whats going on in your life  I agree with you  I don't know him  so I don't think that he is a bad person  so he can't claim that everybody agrees on the fact that he is a jerk   Well right now I'm at one of the best mental hospitals there is in the country   working on my Bipolar Disorder    What I mean is that my mind has stopped developing and is very stagnant  Mental illness started at 15 for me  It's hard for me to connect to my inner self as it feels like its gone  Very abstract concept  It's like a lot it has stopped processing the way I need to process in order to function in the world  I don't know why but its unnerving   Happy New Year   3  Heres the first Album of 2017 for me  https   www youtube com watch v vHUlvFCqpNM You could always prove your grandma wrong I'm not sure I follow   Not a native english speaker  Can you give us an example  The point is whatever you make it be  Sometimes we get to choose which way to go  other times we don't  But we always have something to say about who we are  You are not alone here  someone listens   I'M GONNA R0LL THE DICE 50 50 GOOD BYE OR GOOD MORNING  I'm short  time heals all wounds  The first girl that broke my heart cheated on me  twice  After I found out the first time  I took her back  and then she did it again  It was like getting stabbed in the back and then feeling her twist the knife  I felt like I had nothing left  She was on my mind every second of every day for months  Then  it was a few times a day  and eventually  I went a day without even thinking about her at all  It took a few more girls  and a few more broken hearts  but I have found one who treats me well  who makes me feel loved  and who supports me   Your last therapist was a jerk  People change  sometimes in ways nobody thought possible  Coping is a good thing  but not the only thing  Besides  if you won the lottery you would be so busy dealing with all the people who want some that you wouldn't have time for anything else  Suddenly  you would be the most popular person around  Not in a good way  But today you are a person with depression  not the other way around   Do you have any way of meeting new women   What kind of realism  Hold on a minute here  Talk to me  So you made a mistake  so have I  Tell me more   Probably not a gentleman goodbye  I have to drink away the new year  In which case realism would be seeing yourself as a low level person  I don't know if there are "levels" of people  but please explain  TRUE And I will listen  and try to comfort you as much as I can   Climbing into a bed with freshly washed sheets  Receiving snail mail that isnt a bill  Driving with your windows down  The first bite of a decadent dessert  Laying down on a blanket and watching the stars  Popping bubble wrap  Running through a sprinkler  The feeling after a great workout  Stepping on that crunchy looking leaf  Holding hands with a loved one  Flowers beginning to bloom on a spring day  Dining by candlelight  A relaxing shower after a long day  The feeling of accomplishment after finishing a big project  Enjoying a home cooked meal around a table with your family  Watching squirrels or birds chase each other  A stunning sunset  Freshly basked cookies right out of the oven  Reading a book that resonates with you  That first glorious sip of coffee or tea in the morning   How about those  To talk  Didn't get enough today though How so  I am more of a drone to mine   Okay  How are you feeling  My point about the lottery was a poor attempt at funny  Trying to distract you  or get you to answer  Negative is one thing  suicidal is another thing entirely  I think it can get better  Nobody can promise you that it absolutely will  but I think its possible  If you feel better after going  then by all means go  Whatever works for you is what's important there   I don't see how you are responsible for someone else's choices  He made the decision  not you   I'm really sorry you have had so face these things  loneliness can feel both so crippling and claustrophobic   You mentioned you tried medication  Because these things can often take months to have an effect  I'm sure you know that but I thought I would just mention in case   Do you enjoy co op  games I assume   and driving listing to music  Because if so it great that you at least have some outlet  Which games and music do you like  Yes they do  I have another conversation going right now  What's going on    I am sorry to hear that  Is there someone who can help you  Someone you can talk to  A trusted teacher if you are in school  a priest  anyone   That's not the best thing  Does it rise to the level of calling the authorities   So much trauma at such a young age  You're not in a good place  to put it lightly  and it's completely understandable that you'd feel as you do   You're no attention whore  your feelings are very real  and ought to be taken seriously   If you have a plan  or if you feel you are ready to end it  please seek immediate medical attention   You may feel so alone right now  so hopeless  so lost that you see no other way out of the pain but to end it all     I want you to know that there are alternatives  that this doesn't have to be the end  that there is another way   Please seek help  Talk to a counselor at school  try to get into therapy   Hang in there  Are you able to physically leave  Is there anywhere for you to go to get away from the abuse   I'm okay  Why are you feeling like shit  Please don't do it  Stay alive  friend  Please don't do it  I know it's so fucking hard  but stay alive for even the littlest things  I'm staying alive so I won't have a female name on my headstone  and I can transition to physically male instead of just being a boy in the inside  Find something to stay alive for  Please don't take your life away   But what if the things you learned werent    good things  I learned to never trust anyone  I learned to never let anyone into your heart  because they will surely destroy it  I learned to never open up  People will only hurt you beyond recognition   Those aren't lessons a girl is supposed to learn  Those aren't good lessons   I'm just depressed  anxious  I've never belonged anywhere  at school  at home  at church  I just hate living all together  I hate being me  and I hate where I'm going in life  I just want to escape  I have the same fear of failure  I wake up in a hospital bed and never have a moment of peace again  My ex husband will see my weakness  without having to suffer through my death  My mom will blame herself  without having something to properly grieve  just grief for the daughter she once knew    The world will see my weakness  and I will have to bare witness to that shame  Is there somewhere you can go to avoid her long enough to let things settle  Another room  the garage  I don't know   That sounds good  You are probably a better cook than I am   I am glad you will be fine  Don't want anything bad to happen to you  Its okay to feel that way  I know you've probably heard plenty of "when I was your age" comments  but really  when I was your age  I felt the same way  Sometimes it takes a little longer to figure out where you fit you know  But at 14  you can do anything  be anyone  Sometimes you have to focus on yourself  and just doing things that you like and following whatever inspires you at that moment  and let all the other stuff figure itself out as you go What's happened with you lately  We're talking about you  darling  Coop is for school it's basically a job for school credits to get my grade 12 and I don't really enjoy any of it and plus to add on everything she is messaging me to get my stuff from her place I don't know what to do my heart is racing the thoughts are pounding and 2017 is just two hours away and I don't want to make it it's taking all my will power to not go for a walk and never come back I feel so sick to my stomach that I'm alive  Why  You seem to be trying to help other people  the world needs people who care   I wanna hear about you too though    How come  Maybe so  Maybe I will one day see the good lessons  But    when you lose the love of your life  and your future seems bleak and lonely  it's difficult to try to find the good  The darkness becomes    comforting  Please don't  Talk to me Mostly this  People get down around the holidays  Sometimes I can help   What has really helped me out in keeping clean is exercising  Whenever I feel really depressed I go out for a quick run to calm down  And on a more daily basis try to take up something like power lifting  boxing or swimming  Something like those will take up  All your extra time and really help out   Okay  Well I'm very worried about you so could we talk about you  darling  Just nationality and age then  What's happening  Why something so extreme  I understand about living for other people  its tough to do   Explicit discussion of suicide methods isn't allowed here   See the sidebar   So it's good that  u drnoog9 edited his comment  Do you mind if I send you an email about it  it's really personal and really sad  I don't feel comfortable sharing it here   I'm sorry my friends  I wish you the best I'm not scared anymore this time instead of slotting my wrist wrongly I brought a sharper blade and pills  All I request is that you guys continue to smile and spread your love and happiness  I'm sorry my friends  I wish you the best I'm not scared anymore this time instead of slotting my wrist wrongly I brought a sharper blade and pills  All I request is that you guys continue to smile and spread your love and happiness  I appreciate the thought  I already had dinner  but it sounded good to me  Sometimes we can do some good here   I don't know much about it  I have never had therapy  so I have nothing to judge by  I think that you should be allowed to try different therapists until you find one that suits you  Just my opinion  I can see where it would take some time to get to know each other a bit  but they are there to help you not make you a chronic patient  Can you talk to someone about it  Your regular doctor or something   Being alone  My ex left me a year ago today  I knew I'd be spending tonight alone I have had some crap rain on my parade too  but nothing awesome  Sometimes wanting and having don't go together  Especially if there is something we have to do  over and over again   Sometimes it works  and that's what its all about  Sometimes you don't know what happened   Yes  I know that FtM is a lot easier than MtF  but it is indeed really painful  I'm not able to be even partly myself  I've told some friends  The accept me  but I don't think they understand me  I don't mind  because they're at least trying  I know what you mean  I'm on break from school so I've had a lot of free time lately  Long is relative so it's hard to say  Almost three years I was with my ex I live in The Netherlands  and it's not only school related people  it's also actual psychologists  who told me that they wouldn't tell anything without my permission  And here we have 113  112 is the European 911  so I know where to go  Just wish I found them earlier  I've felt this way for years now  I am never in control of anything in my life anymore and I just don't see that changing I am out of time School starts in a few weeks  three I think  I start working on Tuesday for the first time since last summer Yeah  I don't have anything against SHP and I think it is rather good but equally it would be good to try get some less severe cuts on there more often so newcomers don't get so desensitised and we are all reminded that what we do is pretty bad by most people's standards  Its a great sub but really only shows the severest of severe and I think we all forget that a lot of the time  Even in the 6 weeks or so that I have been on there the cuts have been getting worse and worse  Hey no you're not  There's still time I promise The only real reason I stopped was because it left  so many  scars  I just didn't really want my body to look like that  I think the  worst  part about cutting  besides possible infection nerve damage death overall risk  is that you never  truly  learn how to cope with life when you're using any type of maladaptive coping mechanism  be it smoking  drinking  cutting  etc      I am here to listen  Sometimes I can actually suggest something useful  As to the hair loss  I thought there were things that could help like rogaine  You might want to look into that  A little Google research can get some useful information  I don't have much useful advice about doctors  like everything else some are better than others  I just hope you can find the help you are looking for   Let's talk about it okay  I'm here to listen  I promise you aren't alone At the least  it will be different  I can't say if it will be better  nobody can tell you that   I am sorry 2016 was so bad for you  it wasn't my favorite either  But calling it quits just removes any chance for things to improve   But it does stop it from getting any worse  Good night and Happy New Year to you too  Enjoy the roast   Thanks for taking the time to make such a positive comment  Very nice of you  It does  but it won't matter to you either way  I would rather try to persuade you to keep trying  Sometimes good stuff shows up after the bad   Yeah man I'm playing ranked with a group of friends its defiantly lots of fun   I'm not sure since its the winter time I don't think there is tennis but I know my church has group activities that play indoor sports like volleyball and basketball I used to go but that was a waay long time ago like in my teenage years  there is a YSA ward that I got invited to go that I know they do group activates like that I know I defiantly want to go it will help me make new friends   by the way sorry it took a long time to leave a message and thanks for talking to me  Smarty pants  Just be a tease  go ahead  Raspberry            It just is too hard to go on until something good happens like I can't wait while I'm in pain for something that might show up    Ringing in the new year with an epiphany  Nice  I'm happy to hear you pinned it down like this  and I really hope this insight helps you heal  Happy 2017  I am sorry you are having a tough time  Sometimes it all seems to go to hell at once  One thing goes wrong  and its like the cars on a train piling up  All I can think of to tell you is to take it one issue at a time  Deal with one thing as best you can  then worry about the next one  Break it into manageable parts as it were  I hope you can feel better and get some sleep  That would help too   Can you tell me what's happening  Why are you so perturbed   So you slipped   it doesn't mean you efforts are for nothing  I know you feel overwhelmed but please look for any reason not too  Doesn't matter how big or small so long as you can hold on  You may not care but it isn't Jan 1st yet where I live  It isn't too late to start and restart your goals  Hang in there  buddy  I've PM'd you    I have one person that I talk about it to  Also go to psychiatrist   but for some reason I find it really hard to tell someone that I have social anxiety  I'm OK talking about that I'm depressed but the anxiety part is just so hard for me  I feel like a failure because I'm afraid of socialising while everyone is out having fun  Thanks  I really appreciate it   Hello  I'm glad you did not succeed     Your life is like a whistling wind  coming around a corner      Wash your arm in warm water and wrap it well    A nice warm soft scarf would feel so nice      In time  it will heal  and fade  as with all pain      We are always hear to listen  whatever is on your mind    because you have worth     I get you  My problem is that sometimes I do feel like I've lost  I feel like there is no going back to the normal and that I will ever recover  I guess I'll have to accept one day that its alright to not be like everyone else  It's just so hard when I can't control my mind and thoughts  Forgive me for being rude  but there is the first problem  Who decided you are a miserable loser  You are no more  and no less than the next guy  You deserve the same chances  the same pursuit of happiness and so on  If we deny you your humanity  we deny our own  You are a person with a problem  and that's it  Not a problem with a person attached  See what I am trying to say   Something that can work for me is focusing on the areas I know I can control  I can control the time I make for myself  I can choose whether I make that time productive or not  I can choose to develop new and fulfilling rituals  like enjoying my coffee in the morning or taking time each week to exercise my creativity   That was a start for me  Sometimes I have to force myself to do those things  It does help "ground" me    I'm just suggesting this as perhaps a place to start  Anything in life can be overwhelming if we look at the larger picture  So maybe we refine the steps to take to get to the larger picture   Apologies if this doesn't make as much sense as it does in my head   Next year will be better IF you take some action  Outside of my family it's pretty hard because all the guys I know think that emotions are for pussies if you're a guy  I'll keep trying  I should try Vitamin D  I'm only outside in the summer anymore  So when and how did you stop being skinny  3 You are entitled to disagree  and we will continue to on this point  I am sorry you hate yourself  You are chopping a hole in the metaphorical rowboat while you are in the middle of the lake  Its going to take on water in a hurry that way  The problem is something you have to address  but it isn't all you are  Everyone deserves nice comments you know  You especially right now  If you want to talk  I'm here How do you feel about going to the ER  Yeah I get that  just try to remember that just because you're not out there doesn't mean they aren't still your friends  Maybe try to invite one or two people over to your place periodically  Keep it small and low key  maybe that will help keep your anxiety manageable while still letting you socialize with people   Obviously I have no idea what your exact situation is  but I've found that helps me a lot   Not sure that urge ever really goes away  but it  does  get easier as time goes on to simply not do it  For me  I've mostly become accustomed to the urge  it's something of nature to me as I started cutting 10 years ago and stopped about 4 years ago  I don't know any other life without the urge because I did it for so long and continue to deal with that urge to this day  of that makes sense   I've found talking to other self mutilators who share similar experiences in cutting itself is a huge help in feeling less alone  You are  never  truly alone   I understand that you guys do the best you can   I know the feeling so much  Have comfort friend  People  people refuse to accept who I am  So fuck it I've been trying to go one at a time then there's a new issue and it all just stacks up  I tried to make a list and work though it but I get so depressed looking at everything   I've only been cutting for about 2 weeks  but I've also cut more out of anger and anxiety as well  Yeah I know  I just get down  Sorry about your tooth  How'd you break it  I think its pretty admirable that you're not going through now  Do you have any friends or family you could maybe speak to  Just to stay safe for the short term  Also  the fact you're getting the school credits is impressive  as you're still making an effort  Eat a cheese burger or some delicious food  listen to good music  https   www youtube com watch v 81uJZIF9TCs  hes still thinking about you  you care and so does he hopfully  he sounds like me and what i did with my ex wife  your both kinda   "broken" so dont make it about you or him its both  i feel you while you go through this  its ruff doing it alown with out support  and when i lost everything it was to late before it sunk in  i feel like he has the same stigma with letting people get to close its frighting and feels off putting then theres all the other stuff on top of it  it drives you to do crazy things   Yeah it'll evolve and change a lot  like everything inevitably does  I really suggest you get professional help though  catch it early on and it'll be way easier to work towards feeling better about yourself and being happier  I've been self harming for almost 2 and a half years and have never really gotten professional help except for once or twice from the school psychiatrist and principal  and I really regret it  I kinda wish I had had the courage to tell my parents early on before it got bad  or to seek help on my own   Not saying you have to follow my advice or anything  just trying to give some insight into how this stuff can get serious  You are loved   You aren't alone   You are entitled to feel however you want to feel   Remember your son and know that you are his world and let him be yours  I know  but I'm okay with letting him go  That's why I told him to forget about me  The pain sunk in later  I'm unfortunately fasting in case I decide to take medicine  Thank you for the suggestion though  I took the keys off and after a lot of silence he left    Edit  hit send too early  I don't lnow  its just a feeling  He was willing to forget about me twice in the past  I've given him the golden ticket  You can't but whatever  Death just sounds kinda lit  If its not too late  I forgot to mention    he said I don't know why I bother sometimes  I said yeah me too    Maybe that was a sign  Wow you're a grade A Asshole I'm just a person man  Can you be specific  Apparently I'm the weirdest person in the fucking world according to how people treat me  Maybe  but if I compulsively  urge is quite strong  do something stupid before   Then its over  I honestly can't imagine anything improving  Sorry that wasn't helpful Hey  thanks  I've given myself till the end of January  Then I don't know  i mean   i want to be around for when things get better  but i dont know if i can do it for another five years  my only option to be happy is to leave but i dont want my dad to be sad and my brother is still bawling in his room  You don't care about us  You just want upvotes  Some dumbass redditor isn't going to make people not wanna die  Thank you for your optimism 2 more years man  stick through it  get good grades  go to college  move there  and never look back  Your life will only get better  I promise   I believe he's the love lf MY life  He says he loves me but not sure how much  Even if I derserve better  I don't want to do any of this again  It all takes a toll on you  I don't want to be overly dramatic but I've been through a lot  Enough  I can't  I burst into tears   Hey there   Clearly you did not come here to be harassed   How are you doing    Hey so what's happening with you   Do you want to vent or chat  9 months  That's a heck of a long time  That's super impressive  and it takes a lot of courage and strength to make it that far   Can I ask whats upsetting you tonight  I'd love to listen to what you have to say  Hey  You still there  There's a lot on your plate  maybe we chat Not dumb  it's the emergency room  Hey there  I'm really sorry you're in this situation  I came out a year and a half to my family  my dad included  who is a Fox news  right winged  middle aged white man  and I was sure I was going to be disowned  I feel your pains about this  I'm here for you  if you need anything at all  I'm with you Knife Game as in that game made popular by possible closeted self mutilator youtuber  Rusty Cage    Ooooooh I bet I can stab my fingers better than you  Oh great  now I have the song stuck in my head   On a more serious note  sorry you're feeling so shitty kiddo  hell yeah dude Wanna talk about anything  I'm always here if you need to get something off your chest  How come  Hey  I'm trans too  Maybe we could talk about what's going on  I'd love to hear what you have to say  Hi Conflicted  I have been there with debt as have several of my friends  It took a while but I did get out of debt  I remember a couple of years being stressed about it but when you start slowly chipping away at it  it feels great  One thing I did was see a volunteer credit counselor    As for your job  I've felt that way too  It takes time and experience to find the right job for your strengths and personality but I truly believe you will  I spent some time feeling like crap about my job performance but now I'm in a job that's a much better fit for me  In the meantime you're gaining work experience and learning about yourself  Don't let any of this define you  You sound like a sweet guy  Give yourself credit for coming out and figuring that out about yourself  That shit isn't easy  I will be thinking about you  I am pulling for you buddy    I'm wondering why you put the word boyfriend in quotes  He sounds like someone who means a lot to you  Hope you'll head over to r gaybros if you need advice  Sorry to hear that you're going through this   It's a bad time of year for a breakup  on top of everything else   Could you tell us a bit more about yourself  the relationship  and how it ended    I apologize for responding so late  I decided to go out and get drunk and mobile does not play well with replies   I cannot promise anything  Each day needs to be taken as comes  That said  I don't mind PMing here and there  A worldly tether  despite how faint  may be beneficial to both of us  Sure  if you want  Thanks  man  i gotta ton of shit going on  i appreciate it  I understand  I have recently tried speeding towards a bridge while letting go of the wheel  but the "natural adrenaline" to keep living is still there  so I take the wheel in my grip again  I am afraid that I will survive my suicide  have my body be mangled and causing someone to watch my every move to prevent another suicide attempt  I'm sorry if this is too graphic    I am afraid of these passing years  Ever since I was a kid  depression has been a constant feeling  Meds  amazing therapy  and other mental health aids helped some people  I'm sure  Not me  I think it's because I was born premature  there is research stating that premature babies don't really have stable mental health  and because of past trauma  I'm flawed in many ways  I don't belong  and I realize that a lot of people aren't normal either but it's more severe than that  My apathy isn't quirky or graceful  It causes others to suffer  I'm dead inside but am waiting for my body to die  I understand   I'm pretty sure they only call police if you're actively threatening to kill yourself  which is understandable  The operator requested that I put the pills in a different room and that's what I did  I feel like the closer a person is to you the harder it is to initially tell them about it  You can just open up to them and they help you sort out your situation   A   Here's a  link  https   oa org   to a support group which can help people with anorexia   B   You could get motivational counseling  Many addictions counselors can provide this  It's useful both for addicts who don't want to recover and for anorexics who don't want to recover  It sometimes changes their mind   C   See also  r EatingDisorders and the other sub Reddits about eating disorders   Thoughts  I don't really plan to live past 2017  it's the first time of my life I think say something like this  I'll be 20 this year  on April fool's  actually   We'll see how this year turns out  2016 was hands down the worst   Hi I'm here yeah  Really nice of you to share your music  Happy new year  If you've been sober for 9 months you've heard "one day at a time" more than a few times    I remind myself of that all the time ever since someone told me I'm living in the future  You don't have to think about a whole nother year  Think about today  I always feel crappy on new year's eve  There's something overwhelming about it  I remember lying in bed on the eve of 2000 so depressed because I thought the world was going to end because of the y2k bug  Looking back it seems silly  I'm not trying to call your problems trivial  but just saying problems can seem magnified on holidays    I will be thinking about you and hoping tomorrow is 9 months and one day more    They could help you  You seem very set on seeking help  and doctors can help you feel better  Thank you for responding to me  Can I ask what's been bothering you to give you these feelings  No you don't sound entitled  Put me in a room with 100 women and same thing would happen to me I have had issues with my mess myself  I know the feeling  Think about all that you will miss  I know it sounds stupid but one of the things that kept me going is all the food I still haven't tried yet  Dude  I've been there  Sounds like you should not drink but hey that's not the real issue here  I hate seeing people kiss at New Years knowing I have no one  But right now I just came off a relapse from opiates  Tonight I went to 3 AA meetings and rang in the new year with a bunch of sober people  But now I'm back in the shelter and I pretty much don't have shit to my name and I'm always lonely but dude it could be so much worse    I don't love myself like I should nor am I ok with who I am yet  But eventually when you love yourself and become ok in your own skin then having a girl and having someone validate you won't manner  You'll want it  but you will also be ok in your own skin    If you're thinking about offing yourself just at least wait till tommorrow and re evaluate it when you're sober  I once made a decision on 8mgs of xanax and some dope to eat another 40mgs of xanax and shoot a bunch of dope but I got narcanned 3X and CPR from my own sister who luckily found me but I made it through and in hindsight I am happy I made it through    Just hang in there buddy  If know one told you they love you well then I'll tell you I love you  Happy New Years my dude   Lol  Yup I can totally understand what it is like having two different personas  Trying to keep it together for the outside  Sometimes you can lose yourself during the process  The thing I would do about your doctors appointment is be completely honest with them  If they can give you an initial diagnosis then they can start with the right medication instead of a suture  I did that with my doctor and It has helped a lot  Hi SleepyEnigma  I'm sorry you're struggling  You sound like someone who cares deeply for other people  I hope you'll give some of that love to yourself  You may not think you deserve it but I do  I hope you'll try to do one tiny thing for yourself that might make you feel better  maybe like get some fresh air or pick up 3 things off the floor if you're messy like me  I'm thinking about you and pulling for you  What's wrong  darling  What's going on    Please tell me more  I want to listen  My nephew broke off contact with everyone a month or so before he did it  Looking back  I wonder if that was intentional on his part  hoping to make it easier on us  It didn't  though  we were left with so many questions  and thoughts of what we could have done for him  First of all your beautiful and thanks for sharing  You probably can't see it now but he would be devastated if you ended your life  You have an influence on peoples life's that you don't even imagine  Just for today talk to someone that cares about you  Even the cat you adopted  Just know that your loved   I feel you  At least you had some good times once  No one can say for sure if that's possible again  Life is scary and unpredictable and may get better but doesn't always  I know these words that I'm about to say probably mean nothing  but  I hope you get through this  I don't even want to die  Just hate living this way  Not sure how much worse 2017 might get  Removed   This violates the posted

excellent reasons and we must ask you to comply with them   That sucks  It sounds like you feel obligated to be with her all the time  Like  are you allowed to go out with friends  You have to have a life outside of this relationship  Your only choice can't be to suffer alongside your girlfriend until you are suicidal  And if someone is making you feel like that's your only option  well frankly that pisses me off  I don't even know you and I'm worried about you  You're obviously sacrificing a lot but I don't believe you have to literally  sacrifice your life  When you have no job or money people treat you like you're nothing   Same here  Well think about it like this  If you are dead then you are basically worm food underground  If you are alive  however  you can do all sorts of things  Also you don't have to marry someone you don't love  marry someone you love instead  It's tough being with someone who's chronically ill  I am and I won't subject anyone to that because I don't want to be a burden or resented  Maybe you need it end it with her or tell her how you really feel  At least spend more time apart  Like you girlfriend  I also have CFS  and it's a pain in the ass to deal with  I'm sure your girlfriend appreciates very much how you put it up with it out of your love for her  and I'm sure she loves you just as much in return    Right now it sounds like she's having trouble getting around  so it seems on the more severe side of it  but there's the silver lining of her at least being capable of getting out of her bed in the first place  I think it would be a good idea to stop trying to cling to stuff  Talk to her about getting a wheelchair or something  so she can leave the house easily  and so you can go out and do stuff together like I presume you used to  She doesn't  need  the physical energy to get around if you're moving her    As for your sex life  you could always try doing it places other than the bed  Floor  couch  a chair   there are plenty of places if you use your imagination for it    I hope you manage to get through this all  and I hope that spark gets back into your relationship  Like I said  I have CFS  and while it isn't as bad as your girlfriend's  I think I can speak for her in saying that she is incredibly grateful that you love her despite it   Have you talked to a doctor about your feelings  I only ask because you're desire started at a young age  I really think you'd benefit from talking to a med professional    You're absolutely not crazy  You want to live and that's what I want you to focus on    living  You dying by suicide is not a fact  although I know you feel that way  Your living at this moment is though   For me  today  Editing my mess of a novel  My husband swinging his penis around in front of an open window to make me laugh  Reading a really good book  even though it's complete trash  Hearing my kid sing along to Moana songs today without knowing more than two of the words  Thanks for helping me realize what a cool day I had  I am seriously tearing up right now with gratitude  I know you'll get to feel good stuff too when your dickhead depression gets its ass kicked  Please don't encourage

good  Is there anybody who can take you  or can you take yourself  This type of post is against the rules for many reasons including this one   We do remove them as soon as we find them  so please report them  rather than replying   I'm trying anything and everything I can  It's been like this for me every other day or two  sometimes for days in row  for the last six months  I haven't even been hypomanic since June  Then on top of being depressed  my life is crumbling and slowly falling apart  I just don't know anymore  I worry it's only getting worse over time  I often assumed I'm doing something wrong  or I deserve feeling so miserable  Like maybe I'm a shitty person who doesn't deserve to be happy and I never will be  I haven't ever told a professional about the thoughts  I've been terrified to tell them  I have seen several therapists throughout the years and I never trusted them enough to tell them    Not to mention I also can't bare the thought of them thinking I'm mad or crazy  My parents put me in a hospital when I was 14 because I ran away from home  I never want to go back to that  The thought makes me want to vomit    Thank you  And I know it's not a fact  can't predict the future  I guess I mean that I don't see myself living to an old age  I see myself one day finally succeeding in my attempts to take my own life  It's quite disheartening tbh    A lot of times when I get these thoughts  it's because I can't find a legit reason to live  Like I can't stand living  I find no purpose in it because I guess I don't really value myself at all  I don't know that I ever have  I don't understand how people go through their day to day lives  How anyone would ever want to live in a world so dark and cold    Believe me  I have worked hard and tried hard to get places and be a good person  To love and care for others  To see the better things in life  But I just can't shake these thoughts and feelings  I don't always know how to handle it  I used to drink a lot to make me forget these feelings  but I stopped drinking   It sounds like your in a horribly difficult situation  I'm so sorry you have to experience this  I wish I had some kind of advice for you  but I'm just a kid  For now  I hope knowing someone is thinking of you tonight will help a little    Yeah Im sure finding a good therapist is tough  I can totally understand why you're not interested in telling anyone especially after your bad experience   I can tell  based upon what you've told me  that you've been working quite diligently on things  Ok so let's focus on the valuing yourself part  Is there anything you like to do that makes you happy  You don't have to be an expert at it    Just something that's entertaining to you   This world can def be cold  However  that's why we need people  like yourself  who have been through things  Because once you conquer this part of your life  you'll know how to help others in your same situation    Props to you for stopping drinking  Man I've heard stories of people who couldn't even get to that point  It's rough when you have to confront your demons  I imagine it's as close to hell as one can get  but you've made it this far  You have a desire to keep going  Keep going to your therapist and maybe try finding another  One you can connect with  You are strong enough to get past this  It'll require alot of time but I know you can   Perhaps  Have you talked to anyone about the feelings you've been having  Definitely  Eating makes you feel whole  physically  and kind of    tired  so I used to eat a lot before bed  And when it's something you enjoy  you also feel a little happy about it  as well  if you don't think about how you're using food as a coping mechanism  It worked to help ween me off of cutting and scratching  though I certainly knew I needed to nip it in the bud before I gained serious weight  I used to be able to see my abdominals  damnit  now I can down a whole regular pizza alone   I found myself replacing it with the obsessive behavior I thought I had curbed  years  ago  around the start of puberty  Idle nail biting and the number 5  Almost got nail biting under control again  aside from cross walks  5 isn't noticeable to others and doesn't act as a hinderance to me  Even though it feels silly  I found sleeping with a huggable item helps with urges at night  Begun that a few months ago    No  I just don't seem to trust people irl because what if they ship me to some asylum or something  Depression is pretty common so I think you're safe regarding the asylum part    Is there anything you wanna talk about  Usually I drink some water  get some fresh air and reach out to someone so I'm not alone with my thoughts while I sober up   What's on your mind tonight if you'd like to talk about it  Im having up and downs with bitch depression    I have planned something similar my deadline is about 25 or 27yo  Im actually 22 almost 23  if things get better ill pospose it     All i can say right now is try your best and never ever be afraid of your decitions  i seriously wonder what the societal ramifications would be if people were given the right to easy assisted suicide    you might want to consider how suicide affects those around them   r SuicideBereavement      not that that really stops my own ideation  Talk to me if you are hurt That's so true  I cut in basically the same 6 inch length of my arm for that exact reason  granted I use all sides of it  I hate how my scars look  the layers and layers of scars look disgusting  and waking up every day having to see these ugly marks  that I did to myself  is honestly horrifying  But I don't want to stop  Hey  thank you for the message  I'll listen to it once i get home and let you know  Thanks for the answer   More guilt that friends and family deserve better  the shit truth is  in an indeterminable amount of time  if ever   my life personally has gone in waves  sometimes i want to not exist  sometimes i'm excited for the future  it gets better  and then worse  and then better  and then worse   but i'm kind of tired of the waves  so i've been spending a whole lot of time contemplating ending it recently   Hope 2017 is a good one for you   3 Have you ever felt suicidal before  congrats  man    Of course you should be glad  Be proud   You struggled through a tough time and came out on top  Hang in there and let 2017 be the best year of your life      Throughout mankinds history before any major breakthrough in progression in human rights has been met with adversity such as this leading up to it  And in this day an age  with the level of connectivity we have  progressive ideas are being shared on a massive scale never before seen    The hate in the world is getting loud because they are losing and getting scared  Their voice is now amplified more too  thanks to technology  but they get to be responsible for what they say    No matter how scary things look  this is how change happens  and it's tough  You don't want to leave the world now  Now is when we need people like you the most  People who know what is right and good   People who have the balls to stand up and be the change this world so desperately needs  just like what your activitism this past year has been  Please don't leave us  We've come so far  and these next years are our final test  We really can do this     Goodbye  I hope you stay but know I'll love you either way  I don't think you have to go but I'm not you  If you're around let me know  If not we'll  I guess you wouldn't be able to  Please explain  we can help you    Exactly      Did you have a good day  I haven't  I have spoken to several individuals who have been or currently are if that counts for anything  It's alright  man  Just something my grandfather used to say to me when I got upset  No one will think you're a little bitch and if they do  they're the bitches  Just hang in there man  Enjoy your night     Have you ever had a time where something nice happened when you were least expecting it  Or maybe something nice that you're expecting  Or something you want to do "one last time " That's why I held on  Because I wanted to eat one last avocado but it wasn't avocado season  I wanted to have one more trip to Hawaii  One more perfect 75 degree slightly cloudy day  One more hilariously groan worthy dad joke from my chemistry teacher  It was sort of a fear of missing out  What if something really great happens to me tomorrow  or next week  or next month    At first I started out thinking "this is my way to gain closure " but the more I did  the more I wanted to do  Now skydiving is on my bucket list  although to be honest when I put it on there it was going to be a "test run" for my eventual plummet off a building  Having something at least remotely non shitty to look forward to helps me  and it might help you depending on your situation  although YMMV How do I stop the suicidal thoughts that I have  There is genuinely no hour that passes without me thinking about suicide  What does     From what I've been told  therapy helps many people  Thoughts like those aren't always the easiest to get rid of  I can tell you  you won't be the first and you won't be the last person to tell a therapist you feel that way  It's relatively common and it's ok to ask for help   If you feel it'll help  we can talk  Maybe try to figure things out if ya like  That reply was beautiful  I can't tell you how good it feels to actually admit to this stuff  It can be a huge burden    I do have things I genuinely like  art  writing  drawing  exploring  I'm trying very hard to begin doing that stuff again  I stopped drawing and writing a while ago  I didn't have time for it nor did I like it as much as I used to  I couldn't give it a purpose in my life because I felt like it mattered to no one  not even my family  So I stopped because I couldn't give it value  I've since tried to start again  But it is still incredibly difficult to enjoy it  if that makes sense   I am good at a great many of things  I'm an accountant and enjoy that stuff  not just do it as a job  I'm pretty good at drawing and writing alike  I do mostly fantasy novels  I have passions for science  biographies  nature  Or I used to  I don't know  It comes and goes so much it's confusing     My thoughts literally feel just as erratic as my mood   I was getting in a bad place  Drinking almost every night  secretly  of course  and it wasn't just a few drinks  after I got off of work  I maintained going to college and working while hiding a developing alcohol problem  but my life suffered  I felt like if I kept drinking I would do something stupid  whether it be take my life intentionally or unintentionally and regardless of if it were that drastic or not  I couldn't let myself go down that road  So I didn't  It's hard though  especially when I start having these thoughts  Being completely wasted was so much better and easier than feeling like I wanted to die and if I had the means  I'd do it  It was easier than just living  living with myself    I just want these thoughts to stop  I've had people tell me "change my thoughts  change my life" before  Mostly in relation to my depression issues  I tried to practice this stuff but it hasn't helped  I don't know how to finally feel free from my own mind  I feel like a prisoner and it's suffocating at times    I don't know if I can ever trust a therapist  And it really hurts to believe that because I feel like I need to tell this stuff  that it's important  but I can never be sent somewhere or then call my emergency contact and tell them I have suicidal thoughts  It feels so stigmatizing to reveal this   I'm not sure  I just don't want to feel persecuted and hate myself just because I was born a certain way You having a good time     Exactly  Friends are much better  If you'd had that New Years kiss it woulda been meaningless anyway  Be happy with your friends and don't get tangled up in what you decided you have to do  Thanks man  I've tried therapy  It did not really help   EDIT  It didn't help  I love you  If he stops being your friend  that's his loss  Just try and think positive for the rest of the night  you don't want any irrational drunk thoughts impacting what you do  Try and hang in there until the morning and let me know how you feel then  D  Stay safe and positive my friend      Get someone to talk to  Maybe you need a friend circle to vent through  Are you in high school  If so  what country state province  School in general is never the end of the road  my aunt is in her 50's and going back to school to be a physical therapy assistant after she and her husband of nearly 30 years divorced  There's nothing wrong with showing weakness and you have nothing to feel ashamed about  Nobody is strong or okay 100  of the time and that's okay  If you feel overwhelmed by this feeling  it's okay to reach out to get help  Nobody would think any less of you   Your mental health and wellbeing is just as important as your physical ones  so if you feel like that isn't up to scratch  before you do anything  please talk to someone   I've been to war too  ptsd is an awful burden to carry on your own  Please message me if you can  I'm sorry for what you're going through and know that you have support even if it hasn't felt that way  I'll go above and beyond to help out a fellow veteran   Well    wouldn't you want to make amends rather than dig the dagger deeper  Honestly  talk to a third party  Hell  it could even be me  If your really real  truest  best friends told you that  then you're right   you have no real friends  At least  not where you thought they were  Ditch whoever said that and find new friends  Seriously  It's worth the effort   Survivor's guilt is real  It is painful  And it is hard to get rid of  If you have any opportunity  see a therapist  There are free options in a lot of cities   I have set deadlines for killing myself in the past  They've all come and gone  and I'm still here  When it comes down to it  this is the best advice I can give   whether you want to eventually get past this feeling  or you want to lean into it    if you stay alive for no other reason at all  please do it for spite   https   img buzzfeed com buzzfeed static static 2016 05 18 11 enhanced buzzfeed prod web01 enhanced 20343 1463586258 13 png   I'm here too  I've asked to insist on talking to him  However  I don't know if he will  at least while he's watching over my gf  I think she's the only one that can make him actually talk to me  and we have no idea when  or if  she will ever wake up  And honestly  if he won't talk to me  then it's unlikely that he will allow himself to feel anything if my birthday comes around and there is no relationship  I knew I had hurt him  just didn't know how much  until I tried insisting on talking to him soon  and found out that he refused  Forward an email letter to gf  then ask her to send it to him without telling that you wrote email letter   The year is over  Try to look towards the future  You seem to care alot about your bf so I would recommend trying to contact him and explain to him that your depressed  hopefully he can help  We all had a long day so some rest wouldn't hurt either  It'd be nice if that would work  but this relationship is rather unique  I'm dating a woman who has multiple personality syndrome  mps   and I was dating three of her personalities as well  I'm still dating one  One won't talk to me  and the third is pissed at me because I won't betray cheat the one I'm currently dating  Ehm    that's unique to me  How do you deal with that  It sounds like you have a wide variety of interests which is a really positive note  Based upon what you've said  it sounds like you're forcing yourself rather than allowing yourself to naturally gravitate to an interest  Try this   Dabble in something and if you're not feeling it  stop  Try something else  Interests change often  That's completely normal   You're story regarding drinking is sadly a very common one  It starts with one drink and just snowballs  Stopping in itself is a huge feat   People say that  but it doesn't sound easy to me  Depression isnt something that can be shaken away  For some it's a life long battle  I've been told that if you can remind yourself that depression casts a negative cloud on even the most positive things it helps    Would you consider just initially going in and telling them youre depressed  You don't have to go into detail but feel them out  See if you like them  It might require you to go through a few therapists until you find one that you feel ok with  It can be really tough holding so much in  Depression is very common so don't worry about others think    I know the personalities well enough to know who I'm talking to  generally  And if I don't  then they tell me  It's rare that they have to tell me these days  And how do I deal with it  I treat them as individuals  And the choice I had to make  Either date one of them monogamously  or stay with the other two and forget about dating the one  The really bitter pill I have to swallow is that the one that won't talk to me  he told me he would still be my friend no matter what  And yet he's doing this to me  I haven't been able to get a chance to explain anything really to either of the other two  and it really hurts  because I have strong feelings for each and every personality that my gf has  You're the conductor of train  Don't let anyone slow you down  Just keep moving forward Do u think it was the therapist  I've heard you might need to try a few before you find the one    I'm getting a bit confused here  sorry   You mention boyfriend and girlfriend in the OP  Are you saying this gf has a split gender personality  It might just be me  but you seem to be mixing up terms   I do believe said friend is taking time to drift away from you and render the events that greatly impacted him her  Don't think about it too hard  and contact them in 3 4 days from now  I'm assuming this is another silent treatment mode between friends   You're right  It definitely was not the one  I guess I'll have to keep looking  Thanks  She's a lesbian woman  with five male personalities  and a female one  And the female is lesbian as well  My pleasure  Hope I helped some I am a straight old guy   You have nothing to ne ashamed of in my eyes or in the eyes of my church   However  iI have dear friends who have felt the way you describe feeling  Oh  I'm not really sure  but do you yourself feel comitted to this relationship to the point where you percieve it as healthy between both you and her  Because  if you feel like the hate is too strong  you should back out and seek greener pastures  Easier said than done  though  If I were you  I'd seek some online friends  or irl  ball's in your field  and blossom from there until you find someone who can be the piece of the puzzle your current GF fulfills   And you refer she's lesbian  I assume you too are a female  Thanks  It's been a really tough NYE being alone in a foreign country while my mind is telling me that she's having the night of her life doing shit that makes me want to throw up  Just want to get over this so I can continue my life like back before I met her   I'm female  which could cause me problems with the female personality  IF I were dating the woman  However  right now  my relationship is limited to one of the male personalities  Because the woman is isolated  basically a mental coma   she has not lived her own life for the past six months  The guys live it for her  pretending to be her  This is because very few know of her secret  and I just happen to be one of them  If she ever wakes up  then there will have to come a major discussion of my role among them  But until then  I have a relationship with someone I truly do love  And being a long distance relationship  we will wait until I move to find out how healthy it is  For now  it's healthy enough that we are both happy with each other  Stick it out  then  If you need to talk more  leave me a message  It's 4 AM for me  but it was pleasent talking to you   Albeit  I'm not sure how long her personality as the male will last  but if it doesn't change within a month  I highly suggest moving on   Heading out  so one last auestion   If I were to hypothesize and assume she "wakes up " what would you conclude about her true feelings for you  Actually  before I ask that  how long has this relationship been going for  What personality type was she when you two began the relationship  Maybe it's a pain kink blood kink masochrist sort of thing   Pain itself is pleasurable  and sex is also very pleasurable  so yeah  I see how you can link them together   I'm not in a good place right now but I feel I should contribute   I never had to take meds but I know a lot of people who did  I also know hardcore addicts who went thought hell to fight their demons off   If there's one thing I learned from all this is that whatever your problem is  you'r still the master of your own mind  If you need meds  try to get meds but in the meantime it's still only you in control of your body  When you feel like there's no reason to do anything set yourself a medium term goal  Something that'll make you at least slightly happier    Every morning you wake up is a victory  every day makes you slightly closer to happiness  You'll reach your own paradise one goal a time  just don't give up  Considering that many of her personalities have been "stable" for years  I seriously doubt that she will suddenly lose this one  Oh  and your comment about the hate  the one that's ignoring me doesn't hate me  He's just really really hurt  and thinks that he needs to just distance himself from me  I understand that  but it doesn't make me feel any better to know that  I have the ability to direct emails to each individual personality  so I'm going to be writing one to him and hope that he reads it  There's hope in that  at least  Okay  I see  Sorry  my phrasing may be bad due to my lack of sleep  Let me know how it goes   Thanks for listening  And get some sleep     Nothing festive but long term I'm going to see how long I can stay clean for and hope that somehow my SH doesn't become worse  or maybe secretly I want it to  I dunno  also gonna try get another less crappy job that will hopefully do better at distracting me from my mood swings    D I didn't realize there was a question I didn't answer  so here goes  Her feelings  prior to her isolation  were that she loves me and could potentially decide we could be more  We had a very short friendship  but I believe  and was told  that she was very happy having known me  And she's been a lesbian for many years prior to me meeting her  She already had all of the personalities that I know now  at the time we met  Just to clear this up   the aim of teaching you physics  chemistry and maths is  apart from providing you that knowledge  to see whether you can commit yourself to things and you can even excel in something which you don't even like   Do you really think that when you will be in a job  you'll get to do what you like  Hardly  Many a times  you'll be ending up taking projects you don't like  working with people you won't like  working long and hard hours   this is true of people who even work in what you might apparently think of 'dream jobs'   may be google McKinsey   whatever    So  understand why are being taught these things  I also used to think the way you are thinking right now but as I grew up  I understood the importance of my 10th level Science classes  It helps you appreciate and navigate the world  Look around  70  of the India is believing there is a nano GPS chip in the new 2k note and they are not even ready to accept a scientific explanation that it can't be because they don't know anything about it  Do you want to end up in that state    I completely get the point that life in India is tough  No arguments there  But just remove suicide death from your mind  Easier said than done  but you don't even know what you are talking about  You haven't even experienced half the gamut of emotions that a human can experience  You are that young    Also  for a person who is as privileged as you  you are on Reddit typing out in English   these days many tools are available and many good start ups just look at your portfolio  not grades  Try udacity  hackerEarth  topcoder  Nobody fucking cares about your grades if you good  Of course  top companies will still care about your grades   why  The reasons I said before  Having skills is one thing but in the real world when you are doing a real job  many a times you will have to do things which you don't want to  Saying I don't 'like' chemistry and that's why I flunked it gives the impression that you are reckless and irresponsible  Do you see my reasoning   I also may not make you feel better but I would rather tell you the truth than paint a rosy picture    Another factor these days is the access to information  We tend to compare our worst with the best in the world  Anything less than getting into google is stupid  Anything less than not doing a 'start up' is not cool  US is so 'cool'  I assure you  we have excellent institutions in India for undergrad education if you know how to take advantage of them  Yes  they are difficult to get in to  but then what fun is life where there are no difficulties and no tragedies   Also  stop thinking about suicide  You are just too young to even comprehend the effects and repercussions of the decision you are so freely talking about    Oh yeah  I can relate  it really bugs me when one arm has more cuts than the other  Also  I was usually able to tell when most of the area around the cut is red  and if you touch it it's warmer  and depending where the cut is  it's like it's pulsing  My infected wounds pusled  like you can really feel your heartbeat on it  Small cuts are harder to get infected I think  less space for bacteria to enter  and faster healing time  And  it depends why you want to cut deeper  For example  if you feel like you aren't doing enough  you might be comparing yourself to other cutters  So  there might be a thought  the deeper the better But really  you need to remind yourself it's the deeper the WORSE  and really enforce that   I'm having trouble with this myself but    yeah  Hey buddy  are you alright  Message me if you want to talk about it   Would you want a "Happy New Year " from me  It wouldn't be a group text  I don't do those  but it would be personal to you from me   I gave out four of those  hopefully I'll give out a fifth  I got some positive responses  only honestly just one positive one  But no one sent me any of that to me first and I feel sad  though your words tell me your pain is far beyond simply sad  Like me  did you send any to some of those people that might have seemed to start to like the confident you   I'm sorry to hear the cutting didn't sound like it helped you  Almost sounds like the rum isn't helping you either  I like being wrong  maybe you would let me know I am wrong   What were the classes you passed   I tried to turn my life around  Something changed and I started learning charisma  lost 30 kg  tried to learn interesting hobbies  But the friends  none of the four above  felt like they rejected me and I abandoned almost all the progress I had made  Over seven days I cut myself three times on the hip where I could almost always hide it with clothes  I guess what I want to say to you is that discouragement can come easy  But you have done some great things in what you wrote above  Please don't lose sight of that   If you want to talk more here  let me know  I still hope to give that fifth "happy new year "  Edit  I seem to have missed you and I'm sorry  I hope you got some sleep  I will be doing that now myself   Edit 2  I hope today was better for you than yesterday  don't leave man  your stories are beautiful You are loved   You may feel like you have no way out right now  But you do  Love every day for that day  Stay positive  You will be ok  You control your destiny  I will keep you in my thoughts and prayers   Hugs to you OP  First love your own life  Own it  Don't be ashamed  be comfortable with who you are  Then you won't care so much about others apparent "better life" Second remember that people are putting out a product on social media  They want everyone to be envious and think things are awesome  It's only a fraction of their life captured in time  Most folks find something to be negative about  The key is recognizing it and dealing with it  On that front your at least halfway there  2017 is the year  It's your year  n o zero days own it  If I were in your shoes I'd like to believe I'd start making stealthy preparations to detach and start over as soon as possible   Couple of tips     go after women  not girls  Be confident  Girls are just as nervous as guys  Don't be afraid to strike out     if you don't take a shot    you won't score  It's important to say what you feel     and I don't mean mushy shit  You think a chick is hot    tell her    don't use "hot"  You think a girl is funny    tell her  You think a girls titts are nice     tell her she is smart     jk    All I'm saying    chicks are not that different than guys  They are just as horny and just as clueless as you  If you strike out     go one to the next one  All women has pussies   Nothing is up to chance  You decide your future  Chance your dreams  I have faith  If you fail     you learn     then you try agin  Trust me  crazier shit has happened   Also  Don't be a bitch  Don't look to other people  lol inside  You have the drive  Just fucking go for it Not as bad as you think  Sun is rising I the am   The problem is that I know I"m a crybaby loser  but I don't really want to do anything to change it  And I don't think the US is so 'cool'  I lived there for 7 years  and am well aware of its shortcomings   Hey man  you wanna talk here or pm    Quick edit  its 5am here and i gotta sleep  hope to talk later  Stay safe  Your life has been tough  and no your not over reacting for being through some awful experiences  i can't  say i know exactly  how you feel about your experiences but i do know what it's to be in that dark place  i'm there now too first time in 20 years i've felt like this  went through some rough times when i was teenager   but i got out of it maybe i can do it again  all we can both do is take one day at a time   i'm here to listen whenever you want to chat  scream  vent  cry   Take Care Are you finding the idea of fighting your way back out again difficult  Each place has its shortcomings  I don't know your relationship with your parents but if it is good   sit with them  get a whiteboard and list down what you think are the positives and negatives of India and abroad    It will provide you a far more clear picture  Right now  I'm pretty sure there are many things going on in your mind and they are all unstructured  Writing and listing and talking it out with your parents will be very helpful   I'm sorry if I sound patronizing    I would still like to point out you were very small when you lived in US since you are not more than 15 16 right  I would suggest you to write things down    If you want to go to US  no worries even then  Study hard  build your profile and leave   Yes i am  but i opend up a bit to my GP who has been brilliant  i'm on medication  not sleeping is killing me  i'm so tired all the time My relationship with my parents is horrible  They even told me once it'd be better if I hadn't been born      Each place has its shortcomings   I know that  but India's shortcomings are the ones I have problems with   Have you tried programming yet  There's a lot of demand for it   Me too  Except it's been something like 1 year  Happy new years right  Lol  I'm not in the right state of mind   but we both just need to sober up a little and gain sight of what's true to us    We have a new clean date now  I guess it's easier to remember now so that's a plus lol   I dont have my hopes up but im really happy for you man  Dont give in  we're all in the same damn hole  The meds don't work after about 6 years of trying  So talk to someone about this  If they aren't working then you should have been on something else ages ago    the therapist is apparently bored by our conversation and dozes off during our sessions  So see a different therapist  What in the name of god    how is this acceptable behavior to you    I am just a worthless burden  I would be better off dead  the world would be better place if I were dead   It  sounds  like you have depression  Literally everything here is just you either getting kicked down once and refusing to get up or just refusing to act    Get a different therapist  see a doctor and start getting some appropriate help   Sending hugs and love your way  Hope you are doing fine  If you need someone to chat to drop me a PM  I know how hard this time of year is     You need to spend just a quick second thinking about what will make you happy  Idc how silly or unattainable you think it it    just think it  Then  tell yourself you deserve it  I hope you feel better today  I cannot relate to your deformity  but you know what's sad  I don't have a deformity but still don't want to keep living  You are much stronger  I know  cliche  than I am  You are tougher than A LOT of people  You probably offer more to the world than you know  This suicidal idealization cuts our potential in half  at first  and then it stomps it to the ground  This is me  I have had my potential fucked and ruined  and yes  I am planning to accept defeat as you are  College is a joke sometimes  It's for people who can actually follow rules  Our head is so fucked  so how could we sit there in class trying to absorb new information when we can barely be present   My childhood friend even said  "If you choose to end it  I understand and support your decision " because she knows I have lashed out in conversations about suicide during my teenage years  and once in a while as an adult  Damn  it feels like shit knowing that some people are waiting for you to die  but a little bit of a relief knowing that in time they'll recover  Sigh  this is probably shitty advice  I'm sorry  Just talking to someone for once is nice  Thanks man  Hey  man  you there  I came here from one of your popular posts on Reddit  those locks one   Do you want to talk  I live in Bangalore  if you want to meet and talk  I have no problem  We can meet  I would do anything I could in this situation  PM me   Man  don't hesitate if you are reading this  Just message reply me  Anything  I know how it is to be lonely  But not anymore   Edit  I don't care if it's Bangalore or some other city  I can come to your place in  12 hrs  Just message reply me  Wow  Thank you  Feeling helpless and useless  and therefore bereft of hope  is probably the main reason I've wanted to die  But for someone to say "Now is when we need people like you the most "  and the rest of your words    thank you  I think hearing that I matter  that I  can  make a difference  is one of the greatest gifts anyone has ever given me  Happy New Year  will you be keeping us updated throughout your "treatment"  Remove Facebook from your life so you'll stop comparing yourself to others  Facebook is not reality  People there are fake and post pictures of how happy they are but in reality it's the opposite  Stay away  Why do you think your existence is unworthy  Clearly  your medication isn't doing what it should do  Talk to a professional about this  Preferably right now  Reach out  There are always options  You are on medication because your brain chemistry is a mess  This isn't something you can help  It isn't your fault  You are ill  It isn't something you've made up  They can help you        You're worth it  Life can get better  but you have to let it  Staying in the same situation that is making you so unhappy is not helping the matter  Sit your SO down and talk about what you need from him  He cannot read your mind  Communicate  talk  cry  SHOW him  You deserve to be loved and to be shown affection  However  you also have to let him show you  Try not to doubt him for once  your doubts may well be the reason why your relationship isn't going well right now  It hurts him to have you doubt his sincerity  The fact that he's still there  despite the challenges you face together  means he cares about you  To him  you are worth it  If you weren't  he wouldn't be there  He still has hope  As to having children  I hope you realise there is no NEED for it  Having a child doesn't make life any easier  I'd say the opposite  rather  It is not your duty to have children  If it is your desire to have them  you can  When you feel a little better  you could consider pregnancy  Or adoption  There may be a point where you can no longer have children yourself  but that doesn't mean you can't be a mother  There are many kids out there who need a home  You could become the best experience in their lives      If things don't go well with your SO  consider making a change yourself  Start over  You have been strong this whole while  you are strong enough to hold out a little longer  I believe in you  You are worth your own time  You only have one chance  Don't waste it  Every hour spent feeling like you are now is an hour you could have spent finding help and getting started on getting better  It's so very hard  but worth it in the end  Life doesn't have to be miserable  Allow it to get better  It isn't your fault  I'm rooting for you  You can do this   To clarify I'm not sure what you mean by "living for everyone else " but I would say you should say "fuck it" and start living for yourself   Put yourself as your number one priority and let the people around you know how you are feeling   Because you do matter and your Wellness and safety is so damn important   Also I know the people in your life care about you but sadly sometimes people forget to let you know how much until it's too late  Please don't let that happen let them know how you are feeling and seek professional help you are worth it   I'm sorry you're at this point and hope that you're able to recover successfully from your "treatment" halfway through  if you were to change your mind   it's strange how only music can actually make me feel anything anymore   I've taken plenty of actions  seen plenty of therapists  taken plenty of trips  medications  different kinds     to treat depression  suicidal thoughts  I've been hospitalised  I've done everything there is to do but nothing has helped  this is the way out   Congratulations   I hope I can make another one year clean post next year    17 is too young to have it all figured out  For a career path see a school counselor or an educational psychologist or a coach or whomever and try to figure out what you'd be good at and what training it would require  If you're smart then you'll be good at  something   even if it's not rocket surgery   Lots of very smart people are foolish or even helpless in love  and lots of gay people have poor gaydar  Those doesn't mean you won't ever find love  you've got plenty of time to explore  It took a lot of strength for you to come here and talk about how you feel  You are much stronger than you know     If you are mean to others  and then feel guilt about it later  it may help to try and think of the root of the problem       How long has this been happening  What do you think is the cause     I wish you the best   Taking on a big list of stuff like that is just going to be overwhelming  Everyone's always very hard on themselves but all that stuff you wrote down could be changed if you want it to be changed   I'll also going to college in 2017  I know for sure you'll meet tons of people that you share ideas and get along with  High School for me was a very dark time and I thought pretty much the exact same way all throughout it  Why do you think you'll always be depressed   Here to help in whatever way you need  What's been going on lately   Bc everything has gotten worse over these past few months  I'm sorry Thank you and  u punkrockcrackerjacks for sharing I believe it's true that things will only get worse before they getter  I've been in your situation I know where you're coming from  If this is a low then you have a high point coming up soon and once you hit that high point just go with it  Everyone has ups and downs it's part of being human   I'm sorry you lost your boyfriend  a year isn't nearly enough time to mend the pain you must be feeling  You aren't alone though there's plenty of people who care about you whether you believe it or not  I'm here as a friend for you to talk to  everyone is important to me     I hope some ups come  Because suicide is my only other option if I keep going lower  I'm so sorry she did that too you  You may never find out the reasoning behind her actions but that might be a good thing  The least she could of done was offered you some closure  I think the only way to heal pain like this is time and finding things that you enjoy doing to take your mind off it   I'm proud of you for being this strong  Look at all that you've done  Even if you didn't succeed in what you think you needed to succeed at  you're still trying  Jesus  so many of us just sit around and wait for things to fix themselves  You have a condition that prevents you from doing many things  You having this consideration is outside of your control  That's just how it is  Even through all the adversity  you're still here  still trying  You worked so hard to lose weight  You didn't want to be on disability so you went out and worked  instead of sitting at home  The fact that it didn't work out doesn't mean you failed  You should be proud of yourself  Just because you haven't found what works for you yet  doesn't mean you never will  There's so very much you can do in life  Focus on what makes you feel good  It's the little things that matter  You don't have to be perfect  No one is  Find a new therapist  Try new meds  If you want to chat  please just send a message  I really don't mind     Congrats  I hope you can stay clean for another year  or even better  forever  I understand that  Its hard to handle it all  I just hope you can handle each one in its turn and not let all of it weigh you down   What you say is true  remember we humans are social animals and all of our behaviors are about people and socialization  attention and affection  Its essential  and may be extreme  but remember that people can't do anything about your problems and your loneliness  you have to resolve it yourself  hugs  3 I was high on 20mg of xanax and 100mg of tramadol   a vodka cocktail and cut two lines on my calf  so deep  needed to put 3 medical large bandaids on the lines after disinfecting them cause they kept bleeding through the first and second one    What if it is simply faith in yourself  Believing that you can get better is going to be a factor in your treatment  That is not a lie  nor is it a guarantee  The determining factor in this is you  I have pmed you  Please respond x Yes  not being allowed to be yourself is painful and damaging  Goid to hear your friends give their best to understand you  How much more time until you turn 18   Here to help  talk to me  I haven't gotten to that point yet  but I have lost a little bit of my drive for music in the last couple of months  Music is pretty much the only thing I can understand and express myself through  If it ever gets to that point  I don't think I could go on anymore   I don't know what to say  however  I didn't want to just scroll by your post   I'm sorry that you're feeling this horrible  but I do relate   I tried killing myself twice last year   First time I yacked and threw up everything  and the second time I woke up   Not sure if I'll try again  but I know what it feels like to think that's the last option   I'm 46  not getting younger and have dealt with trauma since I was 3yo   For some people  enough is enough   If I had cancer and was in pain  I'm sure people would be a lot more compassionate about my wanting to be gone   I don't see what the difference is     I'm sorry you're feeling so shitty  but I totally get it  Why should i think my existence is worthy   Thats messed up  Im sorry  I know over here you could report them and get them in some serious trouble for breaking patient confidentiality  I know here if your a danger to yourself or others then they have to report it  How are you today  I can't be 100  sure as I don't know you  but having been through your history  sorry  there's nothing  I think  that suggests that your life isn't not worthy  imo  You obviously don't feel the same though and I think that's sad     tired of living for everyone else   The only reason people don't want anyone else  that they know  to kill themselves is because a local suicide wakes them up to reality  All of a sudden someone they know has realised life isn't worth living  Now it makes them uncomfortable because it gives them doubt about their own lifestyle and makes them wonder about life and suicide thanks  yeah it was a hard program with a 50  fail rate but I persevered   wish I would have saved the money now if things go bad rather than finished it   thanks for the video info  I just can't picture myself being able to go to prison  kind of a shrimpy geeky guy haha  more so because I've stopped lifting and eating like I should   I just can't seeing myself being able to make it that long or any amount of time in prison  I'm a nerdy thin guy    more so because I've stopped exercising and eating like I should   I'm not going to rush to anything yet though I still see jumping as the better option   I'll find out more the first week of February  so until then I can try to have a good time and take it from there   kind of a shrimpy geeky guy haha   If you have time to yourself in the slammer  then that's something that can easily be changed in a short amount of time  I've fallen into a depression myself and I've started working out every day  I was surprised by how much pushups did to improve my posture  All I need is the floor to stay fit and some short sprints every day   I don't believe this element is something to worry about  Just consider yourself a part time professional athlete for a year  yeah I used to weigh 119 and 6ft and got up to 160 at one point  though stopped and started off and on and was about 150 in November   haven't weighed myself since I'd rather not know   probably 140 though Hey  what's up  Oh man I still have this problem  I'm just not gonna look for pics of her but if I accidentally do  it just gets terrible  I'm happy for you though     I'm not sure  1 5   2 weeks total  its good to know that not all humans are assholes You'd be missing out on a lot of good Honestly I could be better  I have a math final in four days that I have to start studying for and I'm exhausted from Kat night what do you for fun  Sigh I just can't shake the thought my plan is already going forward on the 9th of January I will commit suicide I'm sorry you wasted your time talking to me but know this when everyone else ignored me you were there so I thank you for that  Finally someone I can sorta give advice to  I'm 30 right now  and am currently trying to claw back a girl I was madly in love with  but was accidentally pushing her away because I didn't want to creep her out  she doesn't want marriage or kids   Now she starts bringing up I'm conversation if I got her a ring  she would wear it   Like marriage  minus the headache of actually being locked to someone  divorce  etc  I said  holy shit  that's way better  If I ever feel insecure  let's face it  there are guys way better suited to any girl  they are beautiful  more money  better body  etc  the ring can be a diversion  It could also show if a guy respects her by keeping his distance because he knows she's married  So I compromised  That's the problem  Everyone can't have the whole cake  I'm not you  you're not me  let's compromise   Before we got back together  the sex dried up  When we were having it  it was mind blowing  I became attached to her emotionally because of sex  and it freaked me the fuck out  because I may want kids  and she's checking off every box of what I want in a baby mama   I started to push her away and cockblock myself  but I would stick to oral only  She would get mad that she wasn't getting me off  which is understandable  but I couldn't properly communicate that I literally enjoyed barely moving my tongue and turning her into the good kind of whiny girlfriend  So she thought I was getting it somewhere else  This whole thing has been a huge misunderstanding  and I'm trying to repair what I fucked up   As for the house thing  You may have fallen so quickly that you are now terrified to lose him  This is me now  I have always told myself  "don't move in until 3 years  marriage at 5 " I asked her to move in at 6 months  What the fuck was I doing  Turns out I was sort of nesting in a weird way  I had a butt load of money I saved up  went out and bought a car that has easy access to a child seat  is safer in the snow  etc  I used to drive a light 2 door sport car  Now I want to give that to my nephew   I never asked for split rent from her because I wanted to prove to myself that I could take care of her if she ever lost her job  she stayed over 5 nights a week  ate my food  etc   In the end I fucked up  It took a month and a half without her  maybe you need a little break  and a lot of weed to realize where I fucked up  People to fuck up too    Have you ever noticed that your friends always seem to be with the wrong person  Maybe they are the wrong person the whole time  they just won't accept it  A harsh truth in relationships is that if you let her him out and they fly away and never come back  you can't force it  Definitely consider if you are right for each other  Open the door  Maybe he needs to see  holy shit  I miss her  I tried tinder for the first time when we were apart  I was surprised at the number of hits I was getting  But they still weren't her  A lot of women tend to think guys can't be romantic  For example my girl complained a while ago that I never do anything sweet  To ruin it  I was planning a whole scavenger hunt around the city for her birthday  Another time I was trying to shop for this cool northern lights backpack when we were in iceland  go there  Take a vacation here first before a break  Or go alone  It is enhanting  I don't even use that word  ever  unless I'm talking some skyrim or some shit   she would not let me out of her sight  I eventually had to blurt out that I was trying to surprise her and that she was fucking it up  She had the biggest smile when I finally expressed my bizarre behavior   How is your communication  Sorry this is long  it was supposed to be a few sentences  I want to be open so some lurker can maybe get indirect help off of my ranting  Think about blurting out how you feel  If he's receptive  good  If not  you can't force love    but you can also change the way you think and say  this ride that they call life sucks  I love you  and I'm gonna keep loving you even if you don't love me back  This doesn't mean let him use you  etc  But use your judgement where if he was going to kill himself  you love him enough to leave work to talk to him if you are truly worried  or if he's having relationship troubles with a new girlfriend  you help him because you love him  One thing I learned is that talk is cheap  SHOW him that you love him  Even if you have to let him go  They in no way compare in intensity to all the bad  Such as     When one is dead they're not there  They aren't missing anything  They've finished existing  Things that don't exist don't feel one way or another about reality  I guess it's great you've found something that helps you   I just don't feel there's enough of it  It can take me a step forwards  and then everything else is pulling me back again  It might be the reason a lot of us hold on for so long  but it's not sustainable long term  It just slows down the process  But potential exists  and in death you'd be leaving much of it unrealised It's always going to be painful  Least painful would be not doing it I'd be betting on the small chance of something changing   If I have no will left to make a difference  the odds of winning this gamble are very small  Thanks for replying  I was really worried  Good to hear your deciding not to do it for the moment  if you ever think of doing it again this community will always be here to help you out of it   Also I'm no the one with MRSA  the other guy I was talking with is   Happy new year btw     I know these words probably mean nothing to you  but I wish you peace my friend same It's worth it There's a reason we put pets down to end their suffering  i dont know if i want to continue this year  i gave a chance for the '16 but and even with things going to better i just want to end it all  i feel like iam living a lie  dont know what to do    We put down pet's because we can't help them or can't afford to  People are different Some people are beyond help  Not you Books  movies  music  food  babies  puppies  nature  sex  drugs  hot baths  cold winter mornings  a good dump  a new hot girl or guy  brown paper packages tied up with string  Seriously   there's nothing worth not living for  A few days ago I was ready to end it  but the good people of Reddit talked me down  Now I'm feeling better  My parents  well my mother and my stepfather  have always complained to me what an  asshole  and  literal human dick  I am and a  burden   They also belittled about my depression  Just before the vacation my best friend told me he had been lying me to all the time   I hope they feel better when they find me dead by next morning   That's quite soon  May I ask why you want to end it tonight  This is why I don't ask for advice from those who aren't depressed    You dont understand what it's like when no matter what you try to taste  it all tastes like stale bread  And you're sick of stale bread  This is awesome   New year and a new outlook  keep it up      I understand how you feel There's been many times I've felt there's no options for me  it's rough every so often feeling the way I do  I sometimes feel like i do so well because i have good savings  a good job and a nice outlook Sometimes it's hard to keep myself on that level and I go to work every day and it seems im happier there than at home sometimes  I don't know whatI should do half of the time I don't want the responsibility i do have I'd like to be happier   I don't know what brought you here I don't know about you  I can say i've been there  Would you like to mention more about your situation  Tell your boyfriend how you feel  I'm sure he will try to help you feel better   That's where you're wrong  but whatever   Right  you were ready to end it but they reminded you that there's books in the world cause you've clearly forgotten and somehow you know how to feel again  I hate my life  I lost the love of my life and i'm so lonely and sad all the time  I refuse to take my anti depressants and I feel as if i'm a burden to everyone on this Earth Do not let anyone make you feel worthless  I deleted all social media not to see that narcissist asshole  The pain I felt last year was unimaginable  but I know this will soon pass   Thank you for sharing  Wishing you all the best I'm so lonely  I can't talk to my family because they are far away and not a lot of them and very judgmental  I refuse to take my anti depressants  my boyfriend left me because he cheated and said I was too fucked up for him  I cant ever get out of bed Yes  you are the only one who feels sad and there are no redeeming qualities to humankind   I'm awful with computers  I know nothing about that kind of stuff   That's terrible  I've felt lonely for nearly a decade  And it still overwhelms me sometimes    trauma is a bitch  I sometimes wonder how come I never made an attempt   May I ask how you lost the love kf your life  And why do you feel like a burden  That wasn't implied at all   What was implied is that I'm absolutely aware of all those things you listed cause I experience them regularly and it makes no difference   Assuming that reminding me of them will somehow change everything is just downplaying the issue  Have been broken up for about the same amount of time  but my ex finally decided to unfriend me  It's all about making yourself the one who has power to say whatever to the situation  they can't hurt you if you won't let yourself be off put by their actions now  I live with family and it feels like i'm so detatched from them I don't relate with them well at all  Because i'm the responsible one at the house I take care of everything financial and my sister and brother in law aren't responsible at all and i begrudgingly get along with them  I don't drive but i own the only vehicles we get around in   I just got out of a relationship some time ago with someone i felt like I had an honest shot at and she just didn't seem to care about things and she was just not in the mindset for a relationship  She'd ask me for money alot and would never answer the phone  She stonewalled me not to long ago because i got mad at her for it and all the things i've done for her never mattered   My mother gets so upset with my sister and her "husband" that she almost constantly threatens them with eviction and my mother is always telling me about what they do and my mother can't ever have fun with me because of it  She takes awful care of heerself and she never wants to take control of her life  I feel like i bear the weight of the world and my mother being so vain she's never happy  Like recently the pipes burst in the basement and i paid to have it fixed and she made such a big deal over how much i paid for it to be done and it's like itt wasn't worth doing after that  its something i feel every day  I just don't know anymore  sometimes i spend the day in bed because i don't have to go to work and it's more comfortable being in my room  I face that alot    I lost the person i was with because i felt she wanted to just use me for money and it was like she wouldn't care for me like i had thought of her it really sucked  I felt really strongly for her and i thought i could help her and i wasn't good enough  I understand how you can feel how you do because I went through that with her  I'm so sorry  Yeah I deactivated it a while ago  Ended up reactivating it so I could log into tinder but I still never use it    I'm honestly thinking about getting a flip phone  Social media and technology plays waay too big of a role on my life    Plus nobody is as haply as they really look on facebook no matter how genuine they are  They say it all the time  but seriously it's just a matter of time  I haven't gone through any sort of epiphany or anything  I think it's just been enough time    I know how terrible it is to wait and go through every day with that pain  The light at the end of the tunnel feels never existent    If you wanna talk anytime or anything just let me know  Good luck this year   Thanks  You too  It really is terrible  The pain of heartbreak is seriously worse than any physical pain I've felt   I've been on several medications over the course of years and have seen several doctors  I have switched therapist several times  I've seen almost every therapist that the office I go to has to offer that my insurance will cover  I'm sorry if I didn't make that clear  I've tried to get better through various methods several times and it never works out  It's so hard not to think about her  Just hoping it doesn't last forever  It would be easy to forget about her if she was a bitch or something  but she was perfect  And still is   Thank you  you are very kind and you did make me feel better  I'm going to keep trying I just don't know how much more of trying and failing I can take  Things just don't get magically better  magic doesn't exist  If you are bothered by something in your life you have to be the one to change it or you'll be stuck in the same shit your whole life  I know it can be hard to make the change because you think you can't and sometimes you actually can't but that's rarely the case   U know I was in a similar position a little over a year ago  and I'm your age as well  Becasue I didn't feel anything  I said let's just flow with it since I have nothing to lose  I'm gonna die anyway  so let's just do shit I wanna do  No dreams  no hopes  no aspirations  and no direction in life  It was the most relieving feeling ever   I just started living for the short term joys  Like a movie I really like  eating a bag of chips  kfc amd shit like that  U know the little things  Those little things became my life and I couldn't be happier   I have changed now since I have a goal in my life to work towards  You however  may not and continue living for the small things that make you happy   Now you see  I was very apathetic so I didn't give a shit about life at the time  and so I didn't care what soceity thought  as edgy as that sounds   and so I did whatever the fuck I wanted  You could do the same however I think you do care about how society sees you  nothing wrong with that  and so ur path may be different   The way I saw it  I'm gonna die anyway might as well have fun on my way out  And if things got REALLY bad  there's always the option    However  one thing changed all that  Helping other people  The least priveleged people in your society  People keep telling you "you don't know how good you have it" and those words are thrown so often at you that they lose meaning  Only when u help the least fortunate do you realize how much u have had   I'll recommend giving Charity a try  You can make HUGE differences in peoples lives by just spending a day with them  Volunteer at your local homeless shelter  help out at an Old peoples home  play with some kids at a fosters home  give out food to homeless people  This makes a IMMENSE difference in their lives  Bill gates casually handing you  10 000 may not mean much to him but that can change you're life  It's the same  on a different scale   This gives u a sense of purpose and also the work u will be doing is WAY more important than anything anyone else ur age is probably doing  Do it for yourself  I promise it's worth it   It's always painful unless you have no reason to live  or  cut them out of your life  look for work in another city  get rid of as much of your shit as you can and move and work and battle the depression  given enough time away from poisonous people you will find that you're going to be alright  how about kindness  charity and love instead  You won't be alone unless you take the initiative and start talking to others  As a blundering idiot who can't manage more than a moment without doing something that messes someone up  I feel you  I take everything as being my fault and often it isn't  but I can't shake that feeling  I awoke to people whispering about what I was doing in my sleep and how I was last night and that's fun  Most of us can't help but stumble and trip as we make our way through our journey of life  it's not always fun but I always find someway to laugh off my misery  So very true  I can't even explain it  I felt so worthless and sometimes still do  The loss of a person still alive is the worst    I hope I never go through something like that again and neither do you    The worst thing is I don't think my ex went through a heart break  He completely left me for another girl  got her pregnant and married months later    Him and I were together for a almost 4 years  Him and her were married 4 months after he left me It won't make a difference to you if people care probably  it's just the way our brains are wired  You will only feel better if you can manage to live without the need of others  The knowledge that people care isn't much better than thinking that people don't  I'm sorry to tell you that you have to be able to make it on your own to be better  2017 is my year to be a selfish asshole  Time to get started   Yeah when things end badly  it's so hard to try and put our minds at ease  No matter what the other person did wrong I will always blame myself   Yeah  that's definitely the problem   it does make me a little happier to eat   I've been trying to ask myself before eating if I'm  actually  hungry or if I'm looking for comfort  but sometimes I end up saying screw it  I want the comfort   Haha  I've been sleeping with a stuffed bear or pillow for a while now  actually   I have an old shoulder injury from being thrown off a horse when I was younger  and it helps keep my shoulder in a comfortable position when I sleep on my side     Damn if this isn't the most logical response I've read on here   thank you for understanding   Thank you all   I had a rough new years eve but i woke up   I'm here somehow  I feel like absolute shit but its because i survived    I can't since I'm under 18  Pretty sure you could do that here too  The Netherlands are pretty great  Today is a good day actually  Some headaches but apart from that  I'm fine  How about you   Thank you for your service   a lot of demons and ghosts from there hitch a ride back  My ex husband was the same but he blamed me for everything  I mean this man thought I arranged it for him to go to Iraq   if I had that kind of pull with the Army I sure as fuck wouldn't have stationed us in Fort Irwin  I woke up with him trying to kill me  I walked in once just in time to prevent him from killing my dog   was too late to save my cats Ser Meows a Lot and MC Catnip tho   I have my own ghosts thanks to OIF OEF and I've currently planned on today being the day  I've deleted all my social media wrote letters to my "friends" which are the people I attempted to keep in touch with not them working at it in return  I don't know why I'm saying this  I don't know how to stop you but then I'd be a hypocrite because I'm in the same place as you    Perhaps I'll see you on the green and we can lament in peace together    Yep  I still blame myself and try to find an understanding in him  I was nowhere near the perfect girlfriend but I did not deserve to be lied to like that   I can't do anything about it now  but I know karma will come back for him eventually  I can only hope he is strong enough for whatever is coming to him    I wish you an amazing 2017  I hope your wishes and dreams become a reality   I feel the exact same way about my ex still  It's hard because people move on in different ways  but we all need to realize that life cant be solely about pleasing others  we can't let the people who hurt us remain in our lives if they can't do anything to better us as people    My ex was perfect  i was close to proposing to her when she broke up with me out of nowhere  I've thought about her day and night for months now  but sadly  I've realized that since this breakup all she has done is hurt me more and more  and when i confronted her on it she unfriended me  caring more about herself than the fact that i was close to suicide    Point is  there are seasons in people's lives  and yours is beginning a new one  We want to hold on to the perfect moments we have  but reality will move on with or without us  Push yourself to be a better person  don't do anything just because others want you to  happiness will only find you when you least expect it my friend  I used lament wrong   and that adds to my stupidity and furthers my reasoning for leaving this place  FML I got to the point where I couldn't listen to music with words in it because it all just feels so calculated and insincere   Then I moved to instrumentals and classical   Eventually it all became the same   Just meaningless noises that someone shoved together in a song   It all might as well be silence at this point    "Half assed incorrect inspirational quote" But seriously  I know it can suck that you feel helpless  You can complain to your friends because it's highly unlikely that they're always balls of sunshine  In fact id go as far as to say it's near impossible to not relate to someone somehow  just don't become the one who wants to complain every time you are with them  Also no one on here will prove any more useful to you then your friends  I'm not going to be the one to say "don't do it your life is worth something" because I know from experience that it doesn't help the situation  Just know that you're not alone in how you're feeling  there are many of us out there going through the same struggles  It's difficult and if you make it through till tomorrow I hope you find the motivation  purpose and connection you need to be happy  Love from someone who doesn't know you but understands x  I sincerely want to help you with your situation  I have a few questions for you  I don't mean to sound rude but killing yourself is something very serious    How old are you    How did you find out that you suffer from depression  since you mention this in one of your comments  Did you get a diagnosis    If you think your parents don't give two shits about you why kill yourself to punish them  Do you honestly think that could be a good idea    Did try talking to anyone  PM me you want to  17  Born February 27 1999   2 Years of shitty life does that  especially when you don't have many reasons  I have time for tomorrow  I will kill myself because I don't to exist anymore  Yes  I live in a rather small village  I don't know anyone  What does  Did somebody hurt you  or did you hurt yourself  darling  Are you someplace safe  I'm glad you managed to get past her  man  And I'm happy things are looking up for you  too  I hope you manage to find someone in 2017  and that it goes well  He ended up cheating on me and I forgave him but he told me he didn't want to be with me anymore and has been ignoring all my calls and texts  And I feel like everyone im around I just drag them down with me  Thank you  I'm sorry you had to go through that and i'm sorry about your sister and mother  Family can be really stressful sometimes  How come  Thank you  First off  kindly pardon my blunt attitude but I cannot sugar coat the reality for you  A person's life is at stake here  Let me state this as clearly as I can  you are NOT depressed  Years of shitty life does not translate into depression  Depression is a gruesome mental illness  It alters brain chemistry to such an extent that the person cannot reason anymore  Much less talk to people online  If you think that you are depressed  you are mistaken  I  therefore  humbly request you to please get a thorough medical examination before taking such an extreme step  At least give me a chance to talk to you here  Like Luna said  clearly your medication is not doing wonders for your state  Having you spoken to your boyfriend about this  Been to see a relationship counsellor  It would be giving up so much to let this relationship break down now that you've done stuff like buy a house  Try to fix things with eachother  and be up front about it all  If you've been together long enough to have a house and dog together  and to think of kids  then it would be nice to rekindle that love you had for eachother  Maybe that would help pull you out of this  How do you explain the complete lack of happiness outside complete Mania then  That mania happens a few times a year  about week to two each time  I just don't want to exist anymore  If this desire is enough to keep you from killing yourself  then it's enough for you to make something from it  Put that drive to work and start making something of yourself to keep that dream going  You have the desire to do it  and for most  the lack of desire is what keeps them from doing it  I think you've got a pretty good shot at being someone  What was happening  darling  Betrayal    I know what it's like  When I mentioned a decade  that's about how long it was for me until my traumatic event   When I was born it was clear that I was a bit different  I didn't interact a lot socially  and kept to myself a lot  The diagnosis came quickly  autism   Now  this didn't bother me initially a lot as I couldn't really enjoy social interactions a lot  It's a bit like being used to watching movies only in black and white  Yes  you can so much more depth to it with color  which was social interaction for me  but I had trouble with even seeing the colors you can get when connecting with others   As time went on I did get a bit better  and opened up a little bit  And a good piece of news came  For freshman middle school I would be put in the same class as two of my friends from elementary  Sounds ideal  right  After all  if I need help they can give it   But it turned into hell instead  They started to make 'jokes'  about me  which ended up in verbal bullying  But I didn't really accept it  I tried to rationalize it instead  This destroyed me mentally and emotionally   To make things worse  two years later I tried to open up again  And I got bullied  Again  By completely different people  As a result  a part of mine was and still is in many  ways  convinced that somehow I am 'lesser' then others if that makes any sense  So when you mention      I feel like everyone im around I just drag them down with me       I can relate immediately  After all  who would love you  Someone like you   Nowadays I'm doing much better  and have made some very  very good friends over the years  I'm still on my way on recovery  but it's going well nowadays  even if it's a never ending uphill battle   During the second 'round' of bullying I was hoping to put myself into coma  and was even looking into certain kinds of toxic that would do the job  I never ended up doing it because I was afraid of permanently damaging my body  But I did figure out how to produce a deadly poison in my home kitchen   And I can tell you  I'm glad that that didn't end up becoming a suicide attempt  This will sound empty to you and I know it  but there are people out there that are accepting   I hope that you will reconsider  and that you'll find a good path on life afterwards  Even if you don't believe in yourself  I'll believe in you  for you   hugs  Doing well  Just making some lunch for the family  Glad today is a good day  did you do anything to celebrate the new year   Everybody is selfish  Thinking about suicide is not a wrong thing  but please don't threaten someone of your family with suicide   It's very hard for you  but it's also hard for your family to see you in a suicidal state  and if you threaten them with suicide  it's worse for both of you   Do you visit a psychiatrist  Have you told him about not being comfortable in a mental hospital  Based upon our convo  you fall into the non asshole category as well  You might not see it yet but I'm sure you will one day   She was a random person on the internet and I'm on meds and seeing a therpist but none of its working  Thank you  it means a lot for someone to share their story with you  Also i'm glad you are doing better      She was a random person on the internet   You really don't have to care about an opinion of a random person on the internet who is mean to you   How old are you  How long have you been suicidal  Well it sounds like you should record these teachers secretly on your mobile and then send it to your local media outlet  That teacher will be fired pretty quickly  Your school sounds like shit btw  No one deserves to be treated that way   From what it sounds like you just have a shitty person you have to deal with  If it reaches the point you feel you have to stand up by all means do it  In this situation though it's my opinion that you have to decide how you'll handle people like this because there will be plenty of them as you go through life  A lot of the time they will also be in positions of authority over you too  either learn to not let them hurt you or find your way to stand up to them  then quit being impatient and wait until you're 18 and then take the plunge  get the hell out of where you live  I'm 18 I've been suicidal for about 6 months  Self harm is considered any type of method of deliberately injuring yourself  from cutting to scratching to burning to bruising  Self injury I think is an umbrella term and also includes binge eating drinking  so I would think nail biting for pain would count as selfharm  What does make you suicidal if you don't mind me asking  Your body will heal quickest with rest  I sometimes like to think that it's sweet that no matter what  your body always tries its best to heal and take care of you  even when no one else does  It's a little silly but you're made of millions of cells and all they care about is you   I hope you're getting better I hope you're safe  It's clich but I'm here to talk if that is something you want  Good luck  I'm rooting for you   Lonlieness and being a kissless virgin  Thank you  I'm resting a lot and getting a lot water  so I should be fine   Honestly I'm getting worse right now  because of personal events that made me relapse  but in stead of slowly building up like I did when I began  I crashed down to where I was  I've been so much to the ER and I'm so tired  2017 is going to be a much better year than the last  Glad to hear you aren't feeling suicidal today  Best of luck  It was inspired by this photo  http   m imgur com gallery RwzLOD0 Just try to look for a job   Do you have a college diploma  or something    What's your work experience  by the way     Top priority for you  right now  in my opinion is too look for a job  ASAP    After  use Tinder  or another social network   You're not the first and the last one who's single at this age   Also  stop wasting your time on computer  Go outside  and talk with people  Try to look for new friends  Find a bar  or something  I don't know   5 years is a long time to work out  get in shape  read a bunch  and generally improve yourself  Maybe see it as an opportunity  I know it certainly doesn't feel like one  but maybe there can be a silver lining here Hey man  you've said so much  and I can feel the sadness and pain and hurt you express   I suspect that what you share is just scratching the surface of what you feel   I just wish I could help you in ways that are more than merely suppressing support   In spite of how you feel  killing yourself isn't THE answer   Yes  I know it feels like it is an answer  but it isn't THE answer   Please   Please don't let the pain of internet dating be the straw that breaks you     We are here if you want to share or chat or connect  Why not  mate  We are humans  we need to help eatch other     Yes  we have good and bad moments in our lifes  But doesn't mean it's end of the line    You suffer from depression  right now you see your life like a bad thing  You need to see a doctor    100 Euros  You're from Europe  right   What country  if you don't mind  I love sci fi  especially the books  Any favourites   Unfortunately I did not get to enjoy the New Year morning as I passed out into a heavy sleep    But at least u cannot do anything to urself when asleep    Don't worry  You're not the only one at 18 being a kissless virgin  I know you think it's a little shameful  but you really don't have to care  You should r seduction  they really have great tips there  I know I have use some   Again  you   really   are not the only one being a kissless virgin at 18  I was too  Hey man  please don't take pills  can you chat with me instead  You actually tell a sweet story that clearly is a painful event to have happen   I know it feels like the straw that broke the back  but no romance is ever worth dying for   Truly it is not   It is a media myth that has been hyped up since the Romeo   Juliet  I get that   Well said actually   It is common to feel so exhausted and beaten where we get a very narrow frame of focus   I am sympathetic to feeling that there is little else to consider     But like that book and crappy movie  there are 50 shades of gray     There are other considerations besides the absolute ending of life     Or maybe not    I cannot assume to have walked in your shoes    what have you considered to just keep yourself motivated to just get out bed and keep trying  I'm here   I would try talking you out of it   Nine psychs are a lot   Over what period of time   2 years  They all reject me because I'm at a "too high risk of suicide" Meds  are useless if you don't want to cooperate  Try to "waste" your time with something  a hooby  Keep your brain  busy     Don't forget  it's never too late to look out for help    If you need any help  advise  I will suggest you to use   Quora  It's a nice community  Maybe  they can help you  Just give us  some strangers  a chance to help you    Here  watch these videos  maybe they will change your mind    1  https   www youtube com watch v dGiQaabX3 o    2  https   www youtube com watch v QOCaacO8wus t 171s     Wow   Sometimes the issue with mental health professionals  is that it is a job     Must be so frustrating for you   Have you ever actually tried  yes  I overdosed last night  as well as about 6 months ago  Seems I didn't take enough though    It's the only time I hope for anything  hope for it to succeed  I moved to Portland Oregon 5 years ago for similar reasons and I have to say that of course the depression follows you wherever you go but it was worth it in the end  The change was what I needed and while I'm not any better then I was it did change me for the better and I wouldn't do anything different if I had the chance  That said it's a reckless choice to move on a whim but I personally understand how desperate one can get when dealing with depression so I'm for it   Please  No one wants to see you hurt  I know  pretty much all psychological services really don't help  they just throw drugs  all they care about is money at the end of the day  only someone that has feelings for you can truly relate  services do not   Just take some deep breaths  think about this  if you did that  that would be a very painful way to go if something went wrong   By nobody  are you complete convinced  Or are you lonely  I've been distracting myself with food  videogames  and self harm but I guess school will be good to start again  Just as something to do  I'm incredibly lonely  but nobody is true as well  When nobody talks to you any more  there's nobody to try talking you out of anything   Also  I don't care what sort of pain i go through  I just need to get out of this world Well what are some things you like to do  Or maybe things you've always wanted to try   Okay  How do you feel about that  Honestly it totally sucks so I feel you  I'd like to give you some tips to help them heal and keep scar tissue from forming so badly   On the first day after cutting  put antibiotic ointment on it with a gauze bandage  or paper towels if you don't have gauze   This helps prevent initial infection  which can lead to more problems   Every day after that  keep Vaseline on it  even if it's still open   Unless it's super deep and it won't stop bleeding  then go to the hospital    This keeps it hydrated and encourages proper healing  and discourages scar formation   If you have one  use a TENS unit with at least one negative and one positive terminal around the cuts  Direct electrical stimulation mimics the natural flow of electricity through the wound that occurs during healing  In several studies  it has been shown to speed healing time   Take your vitamins  Vitamin E and some B's are crucial in the healing process   Taking an NSAID  such as naproxen or ibuprofen  can theoretically reduce swelling  which may help it heal faster  On the other hand  swelling is the body's natural response to trauma and may be a crucial component in healing tissue damage   You can also take grapeseed oil or extract which can increase tissue plasticity and hydration   Probably most importantly  stay hydrated  Drink plenty of water    I know some people do that thing where they enjoy reopening cuts afterwards for more pain  but that causes more scarring and no one enjoys having the scars bc they make you extra self conscious when wearing short sleeves or bathing suits  So  Hopefully this was helpful   First  thank you for indulging me in conversation   If I may try to make some connections  and correct me if I fail to connect correctly   So it wasn't just this girl    but you feel a pattern in not being able to connect to girls    And you also talk about hurting people    And losing a job    It all piles up  actually  so I can understand   Honestly you can't fix it all at once   Suicide doesn't actually fix anything  but it does help you escape from it all    and dumps a problem on others    but that's irrelevant    let's focus on you   If you could fix just one thing  even if it took weeks  what would you fix    Better yet  if you could prioritize and rank things you would fix and make it worth expending energy    what are the first things to fix  So many people are fake out there  or they feel just uncomfy when you express your true feelings  as if there's nothing wrong with you or avoiding you totally  I completely know that feel  we just want someone there   But please  there must be some moments of hope you feel  even if it's little  How old are you  Well I like to watch tv and long car rides  But I problem is I have so much work to do like study for finals and SAT ACT work  And I'm just so sad about my life and unmotivated to do anything   I'm 20  There are no moments of hope  except for those when I hope my latest suicide attempt succeeds  Those are the only ones  So two years  9 psychs  2 attempts   Sounds like seven psychs were wrong    sorry for the levity    I hope it wasn't insensitive  but I will say  that many did not try very hard   And it would seem almost reasonable to attempt after so many psychs almost approach you with a self defeatist attitude     Mental health care varies so much by geography  and it sounds like you are getting some poor quality   I am glad you are here to talk and share   Thank you   Maybe somewhere in your other posts  you say it all  but would you mind please if you could summarize why you see the psych to begin with   What's your story    There are no painless ways to die  why you see the psych to begin with   i thought they might be able to help  That maybe they could help me not want to shoot myself in the head     What's your story   I don't have much of a story  Nothing special  Did ok in school  was supposed to be destined for greatness  Dropped out of uni  Got a job  Done that for a few months  now failing to live  Well the motivation will come and go  Sometimes I'm really excited to get out and do stuff and sometimes I just want to sit at home and watch tv all day  What shows have you been watching   I agree with u  In fact this desensitisation had blinded me to the fact that I am getting worse at an alarming rate  It will be easier to tell people to stop when they can see where they are and know that the people talking to them have more similar issues  There's nothing wrong with being an introvert   Things will get better  You can't do this  I'm a huge introvert too  Pm me   But I am more introverted than most introverts and maybe I am a bit of a loner   I was a loner for years  I couldn't even relate to my family  Just hang in there a little longer  Im glad I did  I met another loner and we became best friends  She saved my life   Thanks  I guess I will just ignore people who are mean to me and not believe the things they say to me  People suck but you will meet good people who are introverts too  Just hang in there  Please  Day by day  Week by week  It's a battle but you'll win   Before there was long stretch when I felt not good but recently I had been feeling better  I don't know why I started feeling not good again  I think I should spend less time on reddit and look for better people  Thanks again   No  I just slept til 3 pm  ate something and relaxed with the cats You're still very young  I know being conscious and alive is suffering   This may seem weird  but what is your diet and lifestyle like  I've been "clinically depressed" for 8 years straight and it is crippling  nonstop pain  etc  I've had it since birth most likely  since I've never felt right and secure in this world  the pain kept amplifying year by year  That feeling of being utterly helpless and hopeless and lonely is the worst while experiencing that awful pain   you just want to end it no matter what   Then I changed factors in my life  clean diet and exercise   I feel more grounded and sometimes the pain isn't as noticeable with the right distractions  the pain feels more manageable  I know that extreme feeling of pain is there with you right now it may seem impossible to convince you and you just want it gone  but please try and change to some factors in your life to see how you feel  it may not cure you but it will lift a lot of the pain  then you will see more clearly about how to manage things and your life    How well are you with people  Introverted  There are right people out there for you  it's just finding them is the challenge and trying to improve your well being  but it's worth it  then I feel it's best to make the choice if life is worth living or not    When we are at complete emotional pain and stress  we become more reckless just to end the pain  I know reading some text off Reddit won't do much  unless it strikes feelings  but please do continue and try to get better  I know the mental institutions and stuff aren't the best  but there are other ways      Bad idea  Talk to me instead  You're still very young   if 20 years isn't enough to know I  hate something  I don't know what is   This may seem weird  but what is your diet and lifestyle like   It used to be ok  I've stopped caring of late  I just can't justify keeping a body in good shape when I want it gone at all costs     How well are you with people  Introverted   I cannot talk to new people  I cannot use a phone without being terrified  I cannot make friends  Introverted would be a new record for understatements   Don't ever do pills  sometimes nothing happens and you can die weeks later from organ failure  Sometimes you'll be throwing up for hours and in constant pain  It's very unlikely that overdosing will be a nice way to go  Huh  interesting   You have an interesting assumption about approaching people    I think      So what percentage of time do you approach people with this sense of trying to be who you think they would like  What percentage of time do you approach people as authentically as who you are   The card analogy is interesting    I cannot comment on whether the game of life is stacked against you    I do hold a theory in my head  that for how you approach people  if you play the same hand  or different hands  with the same tactics  you will surely lose   Perhaps you don't withdraw  but approach the situation differently     Thanks   I hope this isn't taking you down a rabbit hole   Please know that my intentions are good    Hey there   It doesn't sound good for you in your head   I wish I could help more directly  but I can only really provide support through conversation   May I ask    if you could point a finger at the source of anxiety    what would point at   I ask only about the anxiety  because I often find that depression follows the constant anxiety    like being beaten down by fear    But I could be wrong about you  Haha yeah Reddit will do that to you No death is painless  at least not the kind you can inflict on yourself  Not to mention any possible emotional troubles that could happen too  You're whole life you have choices  but this is one that you can't change your mind afterwards  It's alright  I think talking to me in the first place has been a lot of help already  I think my anxiety comes from failure or letting someone down  I'm not sure though  I'm scared of getting close to people and just a lot of things in general  Well I'm in high school but I hope my major will be something good  lol  You need to understand that you can't let yourself be blamed for everything happening around you  That guy was probably just trying to get in your pants to be honest and a friend was never your friend if they just up and leave  It does sound like you need to learn how you can overcome your anxiety because I imagine that's the root of the depression  For me  I force myself to try and initiate a conversation at least once a day and take note of what bothers me so I can try my best to avoid in the future  Just knowing what can cause you to get upset can help you reduce fear of it  I recommend just trying to space out what you have to do and what you enjoy to do  Maybe you could compile what you should get done in the next hour  day  or even week and label priorities so you don't get stuck being forced to do a lot of arduous tasks in a row  Anxiety comes from the unknown and you can reduce that by decreasing the unknown  there's a reason you aren't anxious around your friends as opposed to meeting new people most of the time   Just freshman year  not as stressful as expected tbh  Hi   Thank you for responding    conversation can be helpful    anonymous perspectives     And as u distant d suggests  there is value in conversation      If we can converse more  it might be nice  So you have and anxiety of failing  and a separate anxiety of letting people down    Is that people in general or just your parents    I often find that anxiety and depression need to discussed and shared    or it all gets bottled up and muddled and confusing for people    sometimes talking about it and writing it out can help people process and gain perspective   Sometimes you can hold a fear in a metaphorical light and it is less scary    like boggarts in harry potter It could be possible that you felt no anxiety because you currently believe that is the only way for you to stop having anxiety  All of these things are in the mind and it's quite easy to forget that sometimes  It's good to see that your going to a doctor  just don't give up if the first one is a bad fit  How about trying to meet someone online  There has to be someone you can meet that can relate  I really wish I could help you out somehow   I know how difficult it is and the feeling of just wanting to end it  it feels impossible to get out of  What about family  I know they may not be understanding  but just being around people should distract you off those bad thoughts  I always try to  but I think I hold back as well  A lot of people have told me the same thing about him trying to just hook up with me and leave  same with my friend leaving  I don't really know how to overcome my fears  I think I get tired of people easily  which I know sounds terrible and I wish I didn't   I don't think I can approach anyone  but thank you so much for your reply  I understand    you have an intent   do you have a plan yet   Also  you didn't quite answer my questions     How often do you present the real authentic you to people  Putting up a fake you must be a lot of work    to be undone and redone    I can't imagine what it would be like to be on the receiving end of the fake you    only to have you reveal the real you   What happens when you start from the beginning with the real you  It is the only was i see out when I'm that low   All I need is money  but there's no way for me to get it  There are no jobs available in my area  and I don't have a car  If I have enough money to get my own place and leave  then I can get better  But there's no way for me to do that right now   I've called hotlines  and I've been to psychiatric hospitals  When I was sexually abused  I was told that I was making it up all three times I called  When I went to the hospital  two different ones  I was evaluated by people who clearly didn't give a shit and came to the conclusion that I was just fine and dandy because 'a lot of people have it worse '  That's why the book is so important to me  It's a chance for enough money to escape  I've tried online  quite a few times  Nobody ever seems to stick around No  thank you for commenting in the first place  Although small  it helps a lot  I think the anxiety could be either one or both  depending on the situation  I think it's more people in general since my parents are very loving people  but sometimes I do feel distant when report cards come up  I'm currently in university  so I feel like B's and A's are pretty good grades  especially when I've been getting A's every semester with one B  It kind of brings down my mood when they say "why did you get the B " and I know they're joking  but I think they're serious too    I have a tumblr blog I post stuff in  but I think that just makes me feel more bottled up  so I felt like reddit was a better solution of trying to talk it out  I just feel really isolated lately and unloved  Like everything's going really bad nothing makes me happy anymore  Glad you're still there  I just made an account for this    hope you don't mind  I hope you don't think of me as a stranger who wants to play savior or something  because I don't   We don't know each other  duh   but I felt like maybe we could talk  If you want to of course   But I don't know how reddit works yet      You've got this  I just hope I don't see my ex hahahahaha     then I might be singing a diff tune   did just take time    sometimes I think maybe I really did fuck up the real thing Listen  I honestly go through the same shit with fear of talking to people but I do my best to try and fix it  It's not like the effort has to be made all the time  just wait for a day when you are feeling good and use the momentum to try carry yourself forward to talk to people  You can even just try to practice small talk with cashiers and others  I however don't think it's going to help much to talk to anonymous people because you don't seem to have any trouble with that  My rule of thumb tends to be if I don't have any trouble doing something then I probably don't need to work on improving it  By chance do you have stereotypical high pressure parents   Balancing life is something that takes a lifetime to achieve   Tumblr can be one way    cathartic in a sense  which is helpful  But dialogue    like the Socratic Method  is extremely helpful to people in helping you find YOUR way      I would say B's and A's are indeed pretty good grades   Yes  A's are the best  but having a balanced life    well that's pretty valuable   As a parent    who was once a kid    well  let's say I like to parent differently than my own parents did   Always happy to chat more if you wish and if this is helpful Internet people are fleeting  I understand  Though  there has to be some kind of community not bs support groups  or some sort  or someone you can meet   I just wish someone could be there for you right now  It's dangerous to be alone with your thoughts and feelings in the current state you're in  I may not be convincing  but please hang in  nobody is there for me  Nobody ever will be That's my point  you convince yourself that it will solve all your problems so you don't fear it  Anxiety is created in our minds by our fears and what we don't know  we can change what's in our minds though  I'm not saying that you can just snap to being a ball of sunshine  but you should try to find what makes get so low  Not just the general idea  really you have to dig deep enough until you feel satisfied you've found the root cause  How big are your fucking scars to repel someone like that  Scars on a man usually aren't all that terrible  Care to elaborate at all  Thank you so much for the reply  I honestly  don't have the stereotypical Asian parents  They honestly want me to succeed in anything I'm interested or put my mind to  I think it's just little comments that get to me  Tumblr is honestly just a journal type of thing  but I don't really have friends people I can talk with personally  I think I'm the "negative Nancy" of my friend group  On a road trip    Went to visit family with a Co worker from the same home town    I'm in the passenger seat right now Well  did something bad happen when you were with the family  Is it the coworker  Or just general things going in life  I agree  I know it'll take work  ok  talk about what  But now we are getting to something    Your insecurities seem to be at the root  Since you are all set  I won't try to dissuade you    Obviously  I would ask that you don't kill yourself  but I am truly helpless to actually stop you   Maybe this will still be a good place to leave a tiny legacy on the internet  Would you mind talking about your insecurities  Do you have telegram or anything  I know it may not be much and not in replacement of IRL contact  But I'll be there for you  online  if you need me  No nothing bad   I just really don't want to live   but honestly   I'm too much of a coward to kill myself    So I just whine and complain  Accomplishing nothing to making a life worth living  Or taking the real solution of killing myself  Never too late to change and do some volunteer work  I'll try more  thank you so much for the advice  I think I just need to really put myself out there  hopefully this upcoming semester since I don't have any of my friends in my classes  Anything  Like    what're you doing right now   they arent huge but theyre mostly all into fat and theres a lot of them  when she first told me about her self harm i assumed the worst  but soon after i realized that shed never gone deep  i have a couple that are pretty thick on my inner thigh but i dont think she even saw them  Hey there  I do not know what you've been through  I do not know you  But I'm here to listen if you ever need to talk  I did not want to assume anything about ethnicity lol  but now  I would presume    Korean    So you do have a friend group to be the "negative nancy"   But you don't feel comfortable confiding in anyone about your anxiety depression     And your sister got help    but how about you  I'm playing euro truck sim and trying to forget that life exists Do you have a song that you can relate to the most now  Definitely  I didn't think I was going to end up to this point  either  What's a genre or band you can feel your experience through the most  Don't  There may still be stars  the earth will keep spinning  the sun may keep shining   But we do not want those things without you   I do not know what you've been through  I don't know who you are  But i do know that people love you  if u can't keep living for yourself  do it for them  You are not alone  wherever you may be  people care and love  You do not know who I am  but if you ever need to talk  we are here  not only me  everywhere around the world people want to help  Not because they know you  but because nobody wishes these feelings to another  Stay safe  we care about you   We Are Here Do you play any other games  That nodream person seemed to care a lot  think they could become a friend  Like britboy1998 suggested  if possible  record those fuckers  and  if need be  make a big deal about it on social media  upload it to YouTube  and whatnot   This is one of the reasons why school shootings happen  and over the years I've come to sympathize more with shooters  as messed up as it may sound   Are you my brother  I'm so glad I am not the only one  Reading this made me at peace with whatever I've came to be  I felt even more pathetic than usual last night when I couldn't vibe to any song  This started a few weeks ago  and now I just listen to regular everyday ambient white noise  How do you do with movies  people only pretend to care to feel better about themselves Yeah haha  I think my username gives it away anyways  Yeah  friends from high school but our relationship isn't very personal  I think that's the right term   It's more like we talk about school and hang out kind of deal  I can't think of any time we really talked about personal problems which surprises me because a lot of us have been friends since middle school and 2 years ago  one of our friend's sister passed away  I've been seeing a psychiatrist on campus who has been prescribing me antidepressants  I've tried therapy  I hated it because it just felt so disconnected  so I decided not to go back after 3 4 sessions  Let's talk  I've had very similar experiences  In fact  I still have them time to time  but not to the point where I want to commit suicide  Hit me up if you want to talk a bit  Been having fights all day and yesterday tired of getting put down I'm actually thinking of just killing myself today    I know it seems that way  And I hate myself for doing this  But you know what  This is the first time I felt the need to try and help  But I know I can't help  because we don't know each other and this is the internet    I have no idea what to say  I am not doing this because I want to feel better about myself  But idk  I'm sorry   Why are the fights happening in the first place  Are you instigating it  I wish you the best of luck No my mom and husband are What are they fighting over  Surely it shouldn't last TOO long  right  My mother and I sometimes shout at each other and argue over small topics  and my brother takes it way too seriously  Maybe you just need to distance yourself for a bit and cancel out the negative atmosphere  Hey my anniversary with my ex is November 9th  And I also recently stopped wanting to kill myself over it    Good for you man  Keep well Not really  I never really learned how to get close to people  I was only in schools until the 4th grade  After that my mom was diagnosed with cancer  I started homeschooling myself and taking care of her  So while other people were learning social skills I was learning to cook  clean and fix things  I have never really been around a lot of people  Even now I work for a company with 14 people in it  Yes  My right arm is where most of my scars are  I think that most people  if they saw it  would say it's bad to have cut at all  but I've found myself frustrated by the lack of depth  Most of them are really closer to scratches  I don't have my usual knife right now  so I've only been able to make smaller and more shallow wounds  Somehow it's so insufficient to me    It's really not a healthy thought process  Self harm is self harm  Measuring it against others  in my experience  only leads to wanting to do more harm  It has to stop   I'm trying to take care of my pigs but it's not helping usually my guinea pigs distract me but they're just making me more pissed definitely try to record the one who said "if I were your father I'd just beat the life out of you' that's not something a teacher should ever say  He should at least get suspended for making comments like that  If u catch him saying soenthing like that again record it   Do you not have music to listen to  No noise cancelling earbuds  Or  could you not drive to some relaxation spot go for a walk  Hello there  I have stumbled upon your post by chance  and sadly  the only thing I can do to try to help you is to respond  Neither of us know each other or what has the other been through  yet sometimes that can be a benefit  No matter how clich this may sound  there indeed are people who care  As Freeconino said  we do care as well  Take care I'm really sorry  I know the money struggle    Sometimes professionals SUCK and don't take you seriously  I have struggled with that too  I was suicidal and they sent me away and told me to take it one day at a time  The shitty thing about mental health is  a lot of people even in the field don't get it  That's why we have to keep fighting to de stigmatize and help people understand what's really happening   I don't want to tell you it'll be okay  but I hope you're able to at least find some pride in completing and publishing your book  What an accomplishment  If you want to talk to an anonymous stranger  I'm here  A lowly psych student with bipolar disorder   Unfortunately no noise cancelling earbuds I wish I had some  That sucks  Don't you wish you could just walk out of the house for a bit  You been okay  I'll try doing that just I've been feeling pretty sick with the flu and just them yelling at me makes my head hurt so bad I didn't do it in the end  probably because I'm a pussy  but perhaps this is a better way  I don't know  I plan something to look forward to every week  so that I have a different reason to stay here for    I really hope that you finally become physically male  It must be horrible to be trapped in the wrong body  I think It's probably your last resort  Good luck  and let me know if you feel better after  Some fresh air couldn't hurt after feeling so cramped up in that house of yours  Yeah I've day dreamed about my own  Thought I was the only one  I've imagined about it since I was like 12 or 13  Question  could cutting across a scar that protrudes from the skin cause it to protrude less  I cut across a scar that protrudes a fair bit  is it possible that the new scar won't protrude and as a results divide the larger scar into two smaller scars  Ty just this whole years been like shit  If you need to talk more  I'll be available  Depends on how you act on the phone  honestly  Sometimes  they'll just try to talk you out of it  You can always talk to me  though  It is not so much a conscious choice of me wanting to  as much as an option that is presented before me  A solution my subconscious has projected onto me  More of idealization   The position I am in is temporary  I will have a change coming in my life soon  I've just been in this state for a while  I'm just holding off trying to work for the future  I am living for the future but it sucks when my life is complete shit and I have no friends and no family to spend time with   Just trying to stay strong but get hit with heavy  heavy feelings of worthlessness sometimes and feel like I don't deserve anything  It is depressing and now is one of those times I can see why you're resorting to the internet  I know it's highly advised against having friends on the internet  but sometimes ya just gotta resort to it when desperate times call for desperate measures  But  eventually  you just grow out of it and a new stage of life begins    Maybe seeing a therapist would be a good option  You may think it's temporary  but it's better to be safe than sorry  You there  man  So much this    well said  Take care  Hug sent  Whatever you do  do it for yourself  Just taking control  living on your own terms  can help  When something fundamental happens  when life takes a sharp turn  its rare that friends can cope  Its not that they are bad  its just the relationship has been flipped on its head  Try making new connections based on your new circumstances  Contact as many MS groups as you can   locally  online  globally  Chatting to ppl who know exactly what you're facing will help   Your family  hopefully  love you  Of course they don't want to lose you  but you can give them ground rules  tell them when they should back off  tell them when to respect your decisions  they need to know how to help you deal with this  Life can be so cruel  sometimes it can help to look at the positives   roof  food  family    Hey buddy    Whatcha wanna talk about  Encouraging words and I know I'll be fine  Sometimes I just need to vent  thanks for the help   Life is full of stages  ultimately you can be happy if you really want to and break free from the pity train  A guy started to talk to me  Was this online or in person  Was he trying to sexually harass you or some sort  That is true  I honestly hate going through random stages where your mind just randomly switches gears and makes life look very gloomy  Honestly  if there was just a way to black it out  I would  It sucks waking up every day and feeling tired and useless  obviously  this doesn't happen to me a lot   You might think he was only going further than "just friends" with you if he was trying to push you into revealing stuff you didn't want to  On the other hand  he may have been trying to understand you better  You were reaching out to him  but you just pushed him away   Don't let it get to you  though  There's definitely people out there who want to help  You shouldn't really give a damn about the backhanded comments  Go back to your doctor  there are plenty of alternatives to Prozac  It is known to have extreme side effects  Do this asap  Does school have a sympathetic counsellor you can talk to  Is there anyone in the family who can give you some time to listen  Try to do calming things   long bath or shower  walking  meditation  If you do nothing else  get to see your doc  Good luck Yes  I often wonder who of the people who haven't bothered with me in years will show up and fake cry for sympathy points  Yeah  even if someone did a scale of SH and pinned it to the top and put more emphasis on the minor cuts at every stage to make the major ones right at the very end  I think we all need the wakeup call of just how far we have gotten  even us "minor" ones are pretty severe by most SHer's standards  SHP is a great community but it probably needs to try make it clear that not all people do it to that degree for the safety of everyone on it and any visitors just starting  It really depends on the person on the line and your risk level  If you tell them you are going to do it and say your plan they are pretty likely to call the police  I would tread carefully but they aren't all bad  It seems the work you talk of is a cause of your self harm  Can you look at changing career  Can you discuss your feelings with your gf  Who says you have to be a "manly man"  Why do you think that is preferable to a gentle kind or sensitive man   You have friends who support you  a partner who wants to marry you  Good luck I wish you all the best in 2017 and forward  Hello mr andrew  I think you're doing a great thing by reaching out and saying what you need to make it through tonight  You're welcome  I like to listen  I'm not good at pep talks but I can listen and I can chat a bit if you like   It sounds like you're in a bad place  You say you've never known different than this dark feeling  if I may ask  is that because you've been clinically depressed since childhood or does it feel like you don't remember happiness even though you had a relatively sorrowless youth  Both feelings would be equally valid because all feelings are  I'm just trying to get a picture of what you are going through    Your girlfriend sounds lovely  How did you meet  What do you like about her most   I like about my girlfriend that her mind is somehow open and full of fantasy like that of a child  We can play we're two jelly beans while having dinner  and within ten minutes she will be so deep in our story that she is crying because a jelly bean has no legs  I can make her laugh by playing peek a boo  She's 21 but so playful    But she is on holiday and I'm at work  So that's why I am on reddit and not in the kitchen taking about jelly beans   In what room do you reddit  I can relate  I feel the same  Anytime mate  that's what this is for haha  You sound like you have the right mindset and are working towards happiness  so I hope you keep on fighting the good fight  Because the sadness never fully leaves  the anxiousness or feeling like somethings wrong never truly goes  How I dealt with it was finding a reason to keep on pushing forward regardless  and it wasn't in love  as that can hurt as much as it can heal    I hope I've been able to help  even a tiny bit  but just know that you're worth the attention  and that you deserve to be happy  So if you ever need someone to talk to  then I'll be there for PM's or whatnot   all the time lately  Your reasons aren't pathetic  You aren't pathetic  Your feelings aren't less valid than those of anyone else here   I usually try grounding  which you can do by taking slow  deep  complete breaths  and to stop the adrenaline  Breathing calmly sounds like a cliche  but it works  If it feels like your thoughts are going a hundred miles a minute  try yelling thinking STOP   really loud inside your head  By shouting the word "STOP" you stop the spiral of thoughts  If it doesn't work  I would recommend contacting a support line  they will help you  Hey there  My living room  Which is also my kitchen and dining room   kinda all one space on the first floor  But it's relatively recently that I've had a laptop and don't have to sit at a desk   Yeah  she's great  and better than I deserve  that's for sure  We used to work at the same place    she's still there  but I quit back in 2015  and changed jobs to a new job that turned out to be 18 months of a nightmare that culminated  for a few reasons  my fault  in a second attempt   I've been depressed since childhood  Around eight or nine I think is when I first started talking about suicide  I DO remember feeling happy once though  I was at home  had just gotten out of the shower  and felt for the first time  that I could remember  anyway  what I thought was happiness  and none of the darkness  It lasted about 15 minutes but I talked about it a lot with both my therapist and my psychiatrist   Your girlfriend sounds pretty great too  A good imagination is pretty great and an awesome trait in a partner  I feel bad sometimes because it's hard for me to imagine things  and it bums my girlfriend a bit   Where do you reddit    D Went to my first concert  and then a few others after  Finished my first semester of my new degree at school   How about you sj  Happy you're still here   sorry you feel like shit  Do you mind talking about what happened  Hey  you sound like an awesome person  It must have taken so much strength and courage to turn your life around  to be confident even if you don't really feel it  Don't be discouraged by this set back  or rather  what you see as a set back  I read a really good quote recently   Don't slash the other three tyres just because you've got a puncture in one  Look at all the amazing achievements you have made  Don't get disheartened because of the text msgs you didn't receive  Loads of those msgs go missing because the networks can't cope with the volume  Those of us with broken brains are going to face the odd hiccup but the bravest thing you can do is carry on  pick yourself up again  You are an inspiring person  you don't need the approval of others to give you self worth  Be proud of yourself for all you have achieved and give that bridge a miss  Good luck Calves these days mainly to hide it  But on the downside I'll never be able to wear shorts or skirts without thick tights ever again  That sounds like a nice open space  Do you move around with the laptop a lot     I'm on my phone  in a hotel room in Innsbruck  Austria  I worked on a train  back to Vienna tomorrow    What a shitheap about that job  that surely didn't turn out the way you imagined  Did you quit now  or do you still have to work at that place    I am really impressed that you've been depressed for that long  and still you're here  with a wonderful girlfriend  working and writing grammatically correct on reddit and calling out for company and help when you need it  I admire that  You remind me of a French friend of mine  I used to get cinnamon buns and coffee with him whenever he wanted to vent  I'd get you a cinnamon bun too but I don't suppose you're in Innsbruck    Do you trust your girlfriend's judgment  Because she chose to be with you for a reason  So your imagination is surely no deal breaker    What do you get as a snack in the cinema  I always get salty popcorn    From other posts it seems as though she ran away So basically you are a competent and smart person who can do several things and do good at various jobs  with skills and people who love you arround  You are worth  you are good  you even consider others feelings while fighting with the pain   You are brave  you fought so hard for so long that you just forgot how good you have been doing   Just don't give up  you deserve to get better  Thanks bro My old scars on my left and right arms are several scratches on top of each other that have merged into an obvious brown patch  I have plans for my arm over the spring though    lets kill m with cuteness   hello You will never see that  though   What makes you feel peaceful about that  If we define faith according to the dictionary  then it is complete trust or confidence in someone  Therefore I am asking you to have trust in yourself  I don't know what your therapist meant  I wasn't there  The more you tell me the more I believe the therapist was a jackass  I can't tell you if feeling the way you do is normal  What the hell is normal anyway   I think most people have had a little of feeling like they wanted to die  or run away  or fade away  As to music  its like a lot of other things  You like what you like  I think that the ideal solution would be to figure out why you hate yourself  and fix it  Not gloss it over with something the therapist made up  or bury it where it will come out again  I can't help you do that  I am not smart enough for that one   If possible  get to see your doctor   Whatever you apologised for  your friends accepted it  You had the courage to talk about the issue  Is it time to put the past behind you   Is it this matter that is troubling you so much or are there other things worrying you too  Can you talk to a close friend  Maybe try not to dwell on this issue  distract yourself with other things  and then see how you feel  Good luck You should try to avoid planning for hurting yourself  I think  That makes hurting yourself a "success"  which it shouldn't be  I can't talk though  I'm guilty of that too  I wonder sometimes if places like these are just a bunch of people giving out hypocritical advice   Yeah  I like it    I got pretty lucky when I found the space I'm in   Dang  Austria    it has to be pretty late there  right  I'd like to visit Vienna  I listen to mostly classical music and would love to see the Vienna Philharmonic   So  the job  I quit already  right after I got out of the hospital  It really is too bad  I was excited when I started but it never got good  only worse  Really exacerbated the drinking problem and generally led to a lot of bad decisions   Thanks for saying that you're impressed  Yeah  I guess that's sorta amazing  My first attempt was 10 years ago last month  in fact  I wish I were in Innsbruck  dang  In the US though   It mattered a lot to me that my girlfriend wants me to live  no matter what  As crazy as I'm sure it sounds  it's strange to me that anyone would feel that way about me   DEFINITELY gotta get popcorn  Maybe something chocolately too  to balance out the salty  Hi  I cannot relate completely to your situation  I am a young girl who has lots of problems with anxiety and depression  and I understand the feeling of how everything is hopeless  If I may offer my advice  I think you should try to ignore this incident with Maya  Some people do not know how to handle a situation they're unfamiliar with  and they react badly  which she obviously does  And what you say about girls not wanting a drama queen  I have to say that it varies  Everyone is attracted to different things  I need a stable person  but my best friend needs someone who is emotional  she needs someone she can support emotionally  We all need different things  and I am almost certain that not all women want a stable guy because everyone is different    Another thing I've learned that helped me is that finding love is not the most important thing in the world  It may seem like it today  with all the movies  social media and stuff that makes people believe that love and being in a relationship is everything  but it isn't  The most important thing is accepting who you are and taking care of yourself  There will always be sides of yourself that you do not love but try to focus on the sides of yourself that you like and appreciate  and things will probably feel better   I understand that you feel like everything is hopeless and that you want to end everything  but PLEASE don't do it  It isn't worth it  I honestly believe that things will get better for me someday  and I hope they will for you as well  Give yourself time to heal and get better  and I hope that you will one day be able to look back at your darkest moments and say that you are glad that you did not end it   Wow man that sucks  You should talk to your room mate about what constitutes as actually helping you    Anytime It depends how your body usually scars  Is the scar red  If you cut very shallow  do you form white or red scars  If white  then it's quite possible this could go the way you want it to  If your skin forms keloids very easily  then you may be creating more problems  Honestly I'd have to see it to know   Before you do anything rash  may I ask a couple of questions  You say you feel half asleep all the time  Is there some chance there is a physical ailment involved  An imbalance or some such  Why do you feel the need to compare yourself to anyone  You are a unique individual with certain talents and skills  Your gifts are not mine  and vice versa  Also  what's wrong with advertising  If its what you want to do  have at it       What I am trying to say is that you are a valuable and remarkable person on your own  We can't all be doctors  who would fix the car  Last  picking up a complex research paper on a subject you are not familiar with would confuse anyone  Every discipline has its own jargon and concepts that most people don't know  You can't be expected to understand that   Have been for years  Fucked up   Noone cares about me  but how many people would cry at my funeral  Once I was alive they made no effort to care  To see through behind me  not even those I call friends   It's strange  When someone dies suddenly they all care  but when they're alive they're dead to them   Alive because of death  Dead but yet alive  It is the same "advice" that that user copies and pastes as a response to any question in a wide variety of mental health subs  No clue  I did this yesterday and I        Really hope you changed your mind and you will talk to us  There are loads of people who care  who will listen and try to help if we can  Please   Guessing you're not getting along with your parents but that can be resolved  either discussing the problem with a third party  or moving out     If you want to chat  please  contact me or a medical centre  please  Try looking at this video  it might seem cheesy but it helped me https   www youtube com watch v PCzth7Vz bM I'm not really comfortable posting picture but as far as how my body scars  some of them become a burgundy colour and some get white pretty quickly  After a while most of them become white  Hit me up if you need someone to talk to  Other than colour  what's the important distinction between a red and a white scar   I'm looking forward to seeing where things go with someone   And congrats again on the little sproutlet   Cutest nickname btw  Does your girlfriend live there too   Vienna is a dream when you're just visiting  truly gorgeous  The people are quite grumpy but there are a lot of great things  I'm a classical musician  so I can totally relate to you wanting that  It's a great orchestra  I saw it at the opera often  What composers do you like  I mostly work with contemporary composers  but I also go crazy for Richard Strauss  Wagner  Britten and the like   Good that you quit the job  doesn't sound like it was good for you  at all    You're welcome  Uh  cheers to the anniversary I suppose  That's a weird thing to say right   I did think you're in the US  Maybe you'll think of our conversation next time you get a cinnamon bun     You two are lucky to have each other  sounds like you mean so much to each other  That is beautiful  And it doesn't sound crazy  Human life is so dependant on relationships with others  and that is a vulnerable feeling at times  I'm also often amazed at what I mean to my girlfriend    Oooh yes  salty popcorn and maltesers  You get me    Right  as you said  it's ridiculous late here  I've a gallery to visit tomorrow and a train to catch  so I'm saying goodnight now  But I will check in tomorrow  I enjoyed our small coversion  I hope it did you some good  Night night  Fire can be relaxing but it can also be dangerous  thanks for sharing and for being safe   Something   anything not relating to police   girlfriends   or hospitals   I feel weighed down all the time  something like chronic fatigue  I hope that fixing that would help some  I just want to do something great  I want to be smart  I have to agree with spideyismywingman   my BIL is a train conductor and he and many others have had to go into months of PTSD therapy because of individuals who use the rail system to end their lives  They do have lifelong trauma and indeed you will be spread out as the above post mentions  Usually the last thing the driver of a train sees is a persons face as they make the jump  I am a suicide survivor  both of a past boyfriend who killed himself on our vacation and left me stranded in the mountains for almost a week and my own horrible depression which caused me to attempt to take my own life  It is yours to do with as you like  but if it were me  and it has been  I would not involve anyone else  even though by proxy of being someone's son  daughter  etc  you will be  Also  posting this definitely does not help me feel better about myself   it's an open forum and as a member of society and someone who has been on both sides  I felt compelled to write  I'm truly sorry for your pain   You like music   Do you play video games at all  What kind of movies do you like  No wonder you're feeling scared and sad  Holidays can be tricky at the best of times but they are really tough when you are grieving or lonely  So sorry for your loss  Have you been able to get bereavement counselling  You may find it will help  Even something online  which would be anonymous  Is there something you could do to distract yourself  A new hobby  Yoga  crochet  painting   You are not alone and people do care  perhaps they don't handle things in the best way possible but they do care  I care  I'm in the uk so probably a different time zone  but I'm here if you want to chat   Just a week ago you received a compliment  and now this  What happened  I'm sorry you feel alone  my friend  and I don't say that lightly  I hate everyone    It's so difficult to deal with people who can't accept you for who you are  But there is hope  And I'll lay it out for you in the most honest way I can   Do you want to change for  her    whoever she might be   That's fine  Everyone wants to be loved  EVERYONE  You've never kissed anyone  Fine  lots of people haven't kissed anyone at your age  Believe it or not  I went to high school with a lot of those guys  One of them went on to make hundreds of thousands of dollars  which makes them incredibly popular for obvious reasons  Most of them  They ended up with average jobs  making a decent wage and living pretty normal lives  But most of them find love eventually  and even those who haven't  3 years later  tend to see at least some progress  they've talked to a girl  or they've been on dates  or they've had sex  It happens  You're not the first person who hasn't had any relationship at the age of 18  and even if you were  you're not in any way less valuable because of it  Most of the people finding love at 18 aren't ready for what they're about to experience  They're not ready to admit their own faults or talk about what makes them uncomfortable in a relationship  they're the reason many early relationships fail to thrive  Billy Joel has an entire 8 minute song called "Scenes From an Italian Restaurant" dedicated to it  I know that feels like nothing  but take into account that it got popular in  1977          because many people knew people just like this  who "found love" but didn't feel secure or ready to tackle that relationship because they simply didn't have enough experience  even if it feels like everyone has their shit together  many of them simply don't even understand how difficult their lives are right now and aren't ready to face reality  Their marriages will fail  AND THAT'S OKAY  You're learning as you go  and hopefully  by the end of it  you will know better than they did when they decided to get married at 17   I changed  oh  fucking christ I changed  but I changed in ways that made ME feel good  It's okay to feel good about yourself  man  YOU feeling good makes other people feel good  believe it or not   I'm not as strong as you  I haven't wanted to kill myself in a very  VERY long time  but I remember those feelings  and feeling so pathetic that even the idea that I would ever get over it was just a bunch of empty platitudes  But it's true  It goes away  It really does  But only if you keep going  Please keep going  If you ever need anything  message me  Yeah    All kinds    I used to go to Bonnaroo every year   Can I pm you  No  I don't want one  I wish my corpse just disappear  I really enjoy video games    I just can't seem to have them be enjoyable anymore    My life hue looks like gears of war    Dull  dull   and gray dull   Not recently    What are you listening to atm  anything good    I'm loving Frank Turner recently   I know exactly how you feel  I feel like my only motivation to stop is because it's "bad" and  because the scars are a nuisance  I don't dislike them  but the reactions from others  especially family  is hard to deal with   Red scars are an obvious sign of hypertrophic scarring  which I call keloids bc most are more familiar with the term  but they're technically not the same thing   They are caused by overproduction of collagen during healing and seem to also be caused by irritation  pulling  picking  rubbing at the wound while it's healing   Deeper cuts that go into the dermis are likely to scar that way  Shallow superficial wounds are more likely to heal white  with normal collagen production during the healing process    The reason this person is wondering is because the red scar could look smaller if it's in half  They're asking bc it might make that scar worse since it already scarred hypertrophically  or  since the new cut would be shallow  it could be pale white   Can you contact a LGBT group  They have loads of help and are always willing to listen or give advice  They can also help with telling parents  Would it lessen the stress to come out to them  Whatever courses you take  you can always change  Nothing is set in concrete  And many subjects have multiple applications so try not to put pressure on yourself  Get as much advice as you can  do research online  get your parents involved if it would help you  And if you just want to chat  I'm happy to help  X That really sucks man  l think they had not a single right to look through YOUR stuff and to throw away YOUR stuff  It's actually none of their business I'd say     Totally understand  was just stating that it's hard to know  If the cut you made was superficial  then yes it is likely the new scar will be white across your hypertrophic red scar   Yeah that's what I'm guessing  My main question was just will the hypertrophic scar "deflate" a bit due to a scar being across it or will it just be like two  shorter raised scars now  let's talk   Nothing against her but don't think she's the right person to be speaking to if you're feeling fragile   Think you need someone who's a bit more balanced in their opinions and perspectives  Hey lets talk   I don't know if its chronic fatigue  I just wondered if there might be a physical cause  You need someone smarter than me to get the right answer  Smart in and of itself is okay  but a lot of it is training and experience  I am guessing you are in your twenties  so experience would be limited by that  You will learn  It just takes time   i think it depends on the therapist  i told my therapist i felt suicidal and they didn't do anything  i'm under 18   You shouldn't be afraid to tell him her if you are tho  I already did attempt though  Hey  I'm also from NWI  Thanks for your service and I'm sorry to hear you're hurting   What kind of books do you like  I am a firm believer that anyone who says suicide is selfish should stick it up their arses and live with depression and suicidal ideation a for a month just to see how they like it    For me  I wanted to die because I felt like I was a burden on everyone around me  In my mind  suicide was the most selfless thing to do  I didn't want it as an 'easy way out'  or to escape from the pain  I wanted to die because people had told me my entire life that I'm a burden and that I cause so many problems  I didn't want other people to have to live with the big black cloud that was me    I attempted suicide almost a year ago now  but failed  I had to deal with my own parents calling me selfish and telling me how angry they were with me  Note  I'm 22 and haven't lived with my parents since I was 18  I have never forgotten the things they said    Think about it like this  when someone calls you selfish for wanting to die   for ANY reason   they're actually thinking about themselves  They're thinking about how they'd feel when you're gone  They're thinking about how much grieving they'll do and how miserable they'll be  Funny thing is  they don't realise that any amount of grief or sadness will never match the pain of depression    So  next time someone calls you selfish for having an illness which makes you feel like you need to die  tell them to go read a little about depression  Ask them if they'd call a terminally ill patient selfish for wanting their life support turning off  If their answer is no  they simply do not understand the illness and are probably too ignorant to try   all the best to your 2017 endeavours OP   Thanks for this man  That must be devastating  my heart breaks for you  Talk to your parents if you can  I would move mountains for my children  If one of them told me this I would not stop until they could be at peace in their own skin  If not  a good friend  therapist  minister anyone  Just get the feelings out   My face looks filthy dirty all the time  GET IT OFF ME GET IT OFF ME   I want to shoot myself  I think I'll go to a gun show and buy a pistol and shoot mysrlf in the head  Probably two shorter raised scars   A bit of rock like five finger death punch   nin  black label society   Since other genres as well    Some r b Tell them not to go through your shit and that you deserve just as much privacy as them  Ask them how they'd feel if you threw away something of theirs  If they bring up that they're "not a danger to themselves " inform them that self injury has nothing to do with suicide and is much better for you than smoking or drinking your ass off  Tell them that your mental health troubles are  yours  and not theirs   You are not alone in feeling the way you do and I can tell you  with absolute certainty  that those who look like or say they have their act together  are either lying or deluded    We are all getting older  nothing anyone can do about that  but you are young  Forget about what you think should be happening  that's just pressure from society  Like being size 0 or wearing purple  Who wants to be like everyone else  Depression or anxiety makes us judge ourselves harshly  Give yourself a break  Be kind to yourself  Try forgetting the past  You can't change it so just learn from it or let it go  Easier said than done  I know  but try  Can you take an evening course to change or improve your career  You may meet like minded people too  Or even just a creative course for a hobby or interest   Finally  you can't change everything all at once  small steps  Walk slowly and steadily and you can climb mountains  Good luck  Absolutely  Don't worry about it  I'm here if you need me   Ahh  I see  I'd read about the different types of scar  but most information I'd seen referenced texture and cause more than colour and such  Thank you   She seems like a cunt  Find a girl who's not that petty about physical appearance and or mental health issues  I enjoy fiction the most    Although I can't focus enough to read anything right now    Some ones id like to reread are House of Leaves  a lot of my Tom Clancy and James Patterson Always happy to answer questions  I'm new here  so thanks for being so kind     What defines adult  23 certainly doesn't feel like one    21 M  What can I do you for  Haven't cut in almost four years  I stopped when I was 18  but I still want to all the time  I do it to think about how many people would actually show their support for me  to show my parents that people actually did care about me and that I did have friends  unlike what they want to think  Haha  I feel so happy for you   God it's been years since I heard FFDP  Do you play   Thanks for your help     That is very unfortunate  Honestly  I cannot say that it is not that bad  However  I can also honestly say that there are some things which may help you feel better   Something that caught my attention was the sequence of events which actually caused you to cut yourself  which you described in    And then months later my friends started pointing out that im more serious now and not as funny  Which is why I realized I had to work harder at maintaining that perception  Which in turn made things ten times worse and more frustrating  I started cutting badly again    Now  this is not any type of diagnoses or anything of that nature but is instead my own personal opinion  It seems to me  that many people who cut  usually do so because it allows them to "solidify" their own emotions "in reality"  In essence  people who are sad for one reason or another usually cut because of some reason  and that reason may be may very well be valid like yours  It is okay for you to be sad or angry  It is a natural response   The issue is that many people in such situations  involving  involving depression or trauma  is that they often begin to question their own sanity because everyone around them seems to be "acting normal"  So they may  feel  like a cut or a scar "helps" by sort of "solidifying" their emotional distress  In essence  some people in such situations may feel that cuts serve as "evidence" of their emotional distress and that therefore they have a reason to feel as they do  Essentially  seeing those scars or cuts may  seem  like evidence that there is a reason to be emotionally distressed  Without them  some people may question whether their own sadness or anger is "right"  because the people around them seem to "act normal"  and may even judge the person's emotional state simply because they do not know the reason for that state of emotion  Thatis something that you may relate to since it seems that your friends' comment may have made you felt as though you didn't have a "good reason" for feeling as you did  Therefore  I think that you should really consider the following points I am about to make   What happened to you is very  very  unfortunate  and it is actually normal for you to feel either sad or angry because of it  Think about it  It would actually be  not  normal if you were completely unaffected by that circumstance  I think most people may agree that  if  some person were to have gone through what you did and was then to be completely "normal"  completely happy and unaffected  then we would probably suspect of something being wrong with that person  of that person being mentally unhealthy  Therefore  your response  being sad or angry  is a normal and natural response    The issues than may be that your friends do not know what happened  And they don't have to  However  since they do not know what happened  they made those comments which suggested that you are "not as funny" as you might have been before  And again  you don't have to be funny   If  they knew what happened  then they would probably comfort you and try to help you  But they don't know what happened  so it may be best for you to realize this  and to realize that they expressed their observations out of ignorance becasue hey do not know what happened    The important thing to realize here is that you do not need to "work harder at maintaining that perception"  You do not need to please your friends  That is because your emotional response  being sad or angry  is only natural  Every person in the world would respond negatively to that rather negative experience  So it may be of some use to accept your emotional feelings as natural responses and to not try to force yourself to change them    You are still in recovery   Think about it this way  no person can blame you at all for anything that happened  No person has the right to tell you or force you to make them laugh  to "be funny"  or to pretend like nothing happened  No person has that right  Actually  it may help you to treat yourself as other people  should  treat you  with acceptance and care  You are still in recovery  It may help you to not try to force yourself to be happy or to act happy but to accept and recognize your negative feelings as  natural and normal   Not necessarily "good"  but definitely natural and normal   Once you do this  accept your feelings of natural  you may not necessarily feel happy in an instant  but you may feel relieved  since you may know that your emotional responses are normal and natural    I suggest that you seek out a therapist and that you tell your parents  Doing so may help you actually see how other people react  No one will think that you are "worthless or pathetic"  No one will  Actually  your parents and the therapist may show you how much they care about you  they may even cry with you  and they may help you realize that you have people around you who are willing to help  but you need to speak  or write  so that other people may help you   In summary  it seems to me that you have had no actual "reference points" since you had kept this a secret until recently  By that I mean  that the people who you saw around you  your friends  didn't know what happened  and even though they don't have to  they made those comments without knowing the situation you are still overcoming  and it may have made you feel embarrassed not only about happened but  also  about how you felt about it  Since they have no idea of what happened  their comments make very  very poor reference points  Their comments are things which should  not  have an influence with how you deal  and overcome the past   Therefore  I seriously suggest that you go to a psychologist or a therapist and that you tell your parents what happened  Seeing their reactions seeing their support  their care and their concern may help you realize that your own emotional responses are normal and natural   That is just my personal opinion on the matter   Also  I think that it may be very healthy for you talk about this  Not only to vent  but also to see what other people's perspectives are on the matter  which may then give you some more proper and helpful "reference points"  points that may help you realize that your sadness or anger is normal and natural  That may then help you see how other people care about you  how other people may support you  how your emotions are natural and normal  and may help you feel better by expressing your emotions through text or speech  while at the same time getting some clearer insight by gathering people's support and constructive or helpful advice     P S   If you want to talk or write to someone  then I am more than willing to listen  or actually to read and consider  to everything that you may want to say or express   I haven't cut in almost 4 years  and honestly the most helpful thing has always been to simply not do it  Easier said than done  but that's it  It gets easier as time goes on  but for some people I don't think the urge ever goes away completely   you just kind of get used to it  Distraction can help  doing basically anything you can think of instead  that's not harmful   Hey there  believe me dying is not the way to go  Have you tried speaking to a psychologist or someone can can help you work your way through this  I can relate a lot to feeilng like a chronic loser    How about with the new year  do one thing that makes you proud of yourself  Can you try  Just start small  take baby steps  and eventually you can become the person you are   and honestly  no successful person was built overnight   Everyone has worked retail jobs before  but it doesn't have to be permanent for you   I don't think you should feel the need the lie  if people don't want to associate with you just b c of where you work  right now   note  not permanently  but right now   then they're judgemental and not kind and you shouldn't want their friendship anyways  Congrats on being able to drink  and even more on the time lapse  Open to a PM    Edit  I'd love some advice   I know that feeling  I'm sorry you suffer with it too   Feel free to PM me  I don't bite   much   Okay  Hey  don't do this  You're not thinking straight  Talk to me instead I'm back    and I concede that you may not be looking for me    hahaha  So  you're providing so much insight   Thank you for putting yourself out there   Presumably  this is authentic you  and not fake you   I would like to clarify since you are using specific words and phrases     "Psychopathic"  many people use this phrase  but you don't strike me as a true psychopath as in someone violently antisocial   emphasis on violence and destruction      This is a casual phrase tossed out there because you FEEL antisocial    Have you ever been labeled by a professional as a psychopath     To me language is important    we all often use language so casually  that we often brainwash ourselves   From what you portray  I would deduce that you have elements of left over low physical self esteem and a cynicism that influences how you view others and yourself   You've learned enough social skill to make an acquaintance  but not enough authenticity and self awareness to build intimacy   People's rejection of you is not that they can't handle who you are  but a common response of skepticism following a sense of betrayal   Your natural reaction to being rejected is also betrayal and distrust of humanity   If I am correct  no wonder you feel the weight of it all  you are in a bad cycle   It is tough  but not impossible to break out of the vortex   It isn't luck    It is the assumptions you make and the logic you develop that follows those assumptions  The major assumption is that you have to be someone else in order to be liked   Again  I don't have to have sex with you or anything hahaha  but you seem like a nice enough guy    assuming you are authentic here   OK  a bit morose    but morose people find connections  too     Again  I'm making deductions and connections based on the pieces you shared with me   If I'm off base  I apologize  and I would welcome additional information   Maybe I'm partially onto something      My point is  that killing yourself could still be an option  but let's really exhaust other alternatives of action  You tried something new  it didn't work out the way you wanted  If no animals or children were hurt as a result  don't regret it  You had the courage to try  Can you try to sort the urgent problem of rent arrears by coming to an arrangement with landlord  Any job you could do or social assistance that could help  Contact your family   what's the worst that could happen  Contact your old friends  everybody loses touch  that's life  but it's always good to catch up  And if you just want to chat  I'm here Art therapy provides good insight into what one likes the subconscious  Maybe draw a few pictures and take a look at them the next day  Let me know what you see    Also  thingy  I laughed a little    Most people can't handle the pain you've probably been through so know that's beautiful   For my age I'm an adult  but I don't feel like one F 24 I started SH a year or so ago  feel free to PM as well This wasn't your fault  darling   For future reference  could you check out r suicidebereavement  It's been hard for me to stay focused long enough to read lately too  but I used to really enjoy the Maximum Ride series by James Patterson  For some reason I've found memoirs are somewhat easier to focus on in a bad period  If you're at all interested in ones having to do with mental health  The Center Cannot Hold by Elyn Saks is fantastic  Hi    Why  Good for you dude  If it works  I'd say keep doing it  24 m feel free to message  hey musician    What instruments do you like to play  Also  have you ever sought support from like a LGBT inclusive group in your city    In my city there's something like this http   www the519 org programs that has fun activities for LGBT identifying people to join  education programs  job finding programs  I think the problem is a lack of community and a lack of people around you that can truly relate  empathize   and help you out     If your job doesn't accept you for who you are  and if your family is not there for you  maybe it's just time to find a new community to be a part of  One that will accept you no matter who you are and will give you a space to be you  one that will support you into using your degree and eventually working the job that you actually want    Do you live in a small town   relatively conservative city   Glad you are feeling a little better    conversation does help   Feel free to reach out if you ever need   I am pretty good at replying within 24 hours  Go for it  Don't know how much use I'll be but sure  I've been clean for two months  and yes  there are  many  times I miss it   Crave it   Ache for it  I'm not sure if I ever will get over it  I used to a long time ago   but my hands have been a bit mangled from army   Definitely not your fault   The decision anyone ever makes about his or her life is a private decision     As important  you would not want the problems of "Gary" to cycle forward through to you and to those that care for you   It is a sad tragedy  and it is an important reminder that every suicide impacts a survivor   Peace to you   Peace   Please do not burden yourself with unnecessary guilt   Guilt cannot change the past   You can be motivated to help others in similar need  though   We are here to help  Thanks for the recommendation I will definitely look into it    What about memoirs makes it easier to you   Which subject or subjects are you ok good succeeding at  Concentrate on those  keep up to date with work  Talk to those tutors  they will be most receptive to listening  and explain what's going on  When you are facing discipline measures for other subjects  show your successful work  Teachers are mostly overworked and not appreciated  Sometimes they push you because they know what you can achieve  Good luck First of all  I'm glad you're still here  and considering telling your therapist about what happened   but yeah  it can be really stressful worrying about what's going to happen as a result of sharing what we've done  even at the same time as we want to be able to share with someone we could trust to help     Despite what  u Lethr4life said  if you were an adult  were able to agree to a plan for safety with your therapist s he felt you could keep to  and your health wasn't already at risk from your attempt  in most places a therapist wouldn't be able to break confidentiality  even if you disclosed an already made suicide attempt    Since you're a minor and since there's a possibility your health could be at risk  how your therapist will handle could vary  Sometimes it can be helpful to ask a therapist under what circumstances they'd break your confidentiality before sharing something you're worried about   and if you're worried your parents would react badly  sharing that concern with your therapist can help so s he can help come up with a plan that makes getting help as comfortable as possible    With regards to methods   we primarily enforce the guideline for our responders unless there's specific detail on how to so you're fine here  but no one here can give medical advice  because the medical consequences of an attempt vary a lot depending on what was taken and the health condition of the person  so only a professional would be able to evaluate that    I hope you're able to reach out for whatever support you feel is helpful and doable for you  I would highly suggest not saying that to a psych  While it may be your 9th  there's always a chance this one will be different and take action  You may not be walking out on your own accord    Unless  of course  you want someone to take action   Why what   Why the downvotes  I hope you are still here with us  I hope you haven't tried killing yourself  I know hope doesn't solve jack  but hope can still be a powerful motivator   To be honest  I can't pretend to understand how you are feeling   It is always described as feeling trapped    If it helps you to vent  then please feel free to share   We are here to listen  Yeah for sure  Can't put my finger on it exactly but I tend to ruminate on my own life a lot  which makes it hard to pay attention to the book  but with a memoir I can kind of ruminate on the other person's life if that makes sense  Rereading an old favorite can also be great though  and it's nice to catch things you didn't the first time around  I haven't read House of Leaves but it seems intriguing  what is it about  Why do you feel this way  I have to disagree with the Vaseline part  While it can help  you should never put anything in an open wound  This also applies to antibiotic ointment   That does sound lie it was weird   I hope you are feeling better Because I have A LOT of scars on my face  Treatments have failed and my life is ruined  How come it's ruining your life  It's not just teenagers  everyone's got it bad  One of my stays at a hospital I met a Vietnam vet who witnessed his friends be shot  Not to mention the story he told us of how when he was six  his Mom shot his dad in front of him  He went through an addiction to heroin to  I'm only 20  so don't act like I'm just some grown up telling you how it is but often teenagers are overlooked because we tend to exaggerate  Some often just want attention  basically we haven't fully developed into our own person yet and that can cause problems  I do ask that you think long and hard about whatever choice you are about to make and why you haven't yet  I banged this out rly quick  so I should prob do an edit  Ik you don't put anything in an "open" wound  but most fresh cuts  by fresh I mean within a day  aren't really "open"   Do you think a different therapist or change of treatment would help  Could you add some complimentary treatments like yoga or meditation  Change or improve your diet  That sort of thing  Can you join a club or sign up for a course or class   There's a book How To Be Sick by Toni Bernhard which helps with living with a long term condition  I found it useful  Hope this reply gives some food for thought  Always happy to chat  22  don't feel like an adult  Feel free to message if you need to  I'm sorry but in the end you can't do anything to make others change  you can only try and make yourself better able to ignore what others put you through  I recommend trying to learn how best you cope when they are rude  remember kids are kids so they can learn not to be assholes  All our child is a developmental stage designed to make us a better human and it's my opinion that the assholes in this world are there because people changed for them  Be your own person but don't let others overwhelm you  if you want to be their friend then you will find a way   Hey  glad you won't kill yourself  and there is nothing ever wrong with being alone and productive    quite frankly there is way too much emphasis on having a romantic connection for a sense of "completion "  It's a lot of rubbish that is hyped by society   It's worse in modern times  because it is used to sell     I would disagree that you've failed   Your words strongly suggest that you are moderately successful   If anything  you've not realized your potential  but still make strides   Some things take significant repetition and effort    trial and error  as it were     From what I gather  you seem like a do it yourselfer      For music  art  and dating  what type of training and practice did you pursue to become better  It is perceived as a weakness and is a deal breaker to many people  I feel discriminated against  Clarified  Thanks Before you do  just make sure you take enough time on the bridge to decide it's what you really want  Also please for the love of god don't do it drunk  you can't be trusted to do what you really want when that happens   Can you elaborate  Dude  I feel this  I haven't gone through much comparitively  yet here I am   You are not pathetic and nor are your reasons  Everything is valid  A reason is not necessarily good nor bad  it's just a reason  We're all just trying to survive in ways we know    To answer your question yes  I have many different experiences as it happens  including the ones you've experienced   You're not a pussy if you don't kill yourself  you're not one of you do  All it means if you think that you should kill yourself and haven't is that in the back of your mind you have a reason to live  Also you said in part you won't because it would hurt your parents  you have empathy  something often undervalued  You live life for chance to put meaning to whatever the hell you want  could be money or charity or friendship or whatever the hell you feel like  The point of life is to be your own person and do what you think you should  if that's just spend time with you cat until you want human interactions then rock it  Make sure you are 100  confident in whatever you do do  Lots of INFPs checking in I see   Thank you  I really appreciate it  People began treating me much differently after developing the scars  I believe that the scarring throws off the contour and balance of my face  and this implies a disorder or incompetence  People are short with me  I am punished more severely for simple mistakes than my peers  This makes it very difficult  if not impossible to advance my career or earn a living wage  Socializing is a challenge and it seems impossible for me to have a family     Judging by your use of soul and other specific words that brought it to my attention  sounds like you are religious at least subconsciously you believe in a god  Which means maybe you feel empty because you aren't living up to whatever religion you were raised up to believe  If you think that could be the problem you could go to a priest rabbi monk  sorry I don't know many holy man terms  and ask them to help guide you  Friendship and family can only help  you leave a pit of depression it's them who keep you on track towards your goal if you start trailing away  If you seriously believe you have a substance abuse problem then come clean to someone and ask for help  Rehab may be what you need  if just for the chance to give you time to reflect on yourself  The only positive I got from my stays at hospitals were my quiet reflections  Anxiety   The term no one ever understands is kind of a bold statement  and it's never very good to use  Do you want to try explaining it more in detail to me  Yeah It started about 6 months ago and has been getting worse and worse everyday  Hmmm  you are not alone   The teen years are very tough years  You are not a baby   You can take care of yourself  but you cannot live independently in an adult world   There are many new complex feelings that one does not have when one is less than ten     What you are feeling is confusing and overwhelming   It happens all at once  and it happens to nearly every person growing up   It is easy to get beaten down  but you are doing something good for yourself    you are writing it out and getting help   You have stopped cutting   You have stopped smoking   Both successes and improvements   You can learn to be less introverted and social    it takes practice  and strength to get through rejection   You can learn to articulate and sort through feelings and emotions   You can learn to care care  and you can learn to improve at school   It may be hard to do it all at once  but perhaps you can focus on one or two things at a time so as to reduce being overwhelmed   You can pick priorities that help you get to your future instead of just distracting you from what you need to do to get to your future   We are here to listen and to be supportive Hey  I'm only here because this is one of the few things that makes me feel like a less shitty person  So thanks for making me feel like a made a difference  Were you upset before then  or did the depression start at that time too  You need someone to talk to  I could never get into gears of war    but i play plenty of games  Mainly doing a mmo right  Seems to help snap me out of my depression since i have something to work for  Do you play any mmos  Hey  you still there  I don't have Kik or WhatsApp  but if you want to talk here I'll be around for a while  I can't promise to make anything better  but I can be your friend That's a bummer  I know these charities and helplines are under pressure from financial   staff shortages  but most people make that call as a last resort  So sorry you couldn't get the help you needed  If its any consolation   I contacted the main 'suicide' charity twice  first time  the chap told me to 'do it' if I felt so bad    the charity contacted me to apologise  the guy was having a bad day     The second time  the lass confused me with someone else and was asking questions about a broken leg   other matters not related to me  Have you been able to talk to someone  A doctor  A E or ER  Are you ok for now  If you want to chat  I'm here Not really   I used to play world of warcraft  that's about as close as I get   I guess I could try Diablo 3 again and keep ranking up   maybe the mindless destroying will make me take my mind off of things  Never think that your situation is permanent  Get through school  EDUCATION IS THE WAY OUT  I felt like I was drowning in my home town  I left and it was the best thing that ever happened to me  All I can say is hold on and that you're worth something  It sounds like you're young as hell  Just never think your situation is permanent   It's really hard to describe what House of Leaves is about   It kind of jumps from the story in the book to another story further in the book   The edition I have has a really weird lay out of some pages in the later chapters   It's a really neat read    yes please i feel like i have no one   I've been dealing with depression since i was about 4 but it was minor  Do you want to talk about this   I know exactly what it feels like in your situation   I told my mom that I would buy a gun and blow my brains out   I didn't   I somehow found the strength to keep moving on   please  if you're reading this  respond  Hey buddy  I'm sorry you're having a rough time  Would you tell us why you feel like you want to end your life   I am still alive  I am certainly not a psychologist  so diagnosing anything is not my line  All I can tell you is to listen to what you like to listen to  If we are going to be judged on what we like and don't like  nobody is normal  The point I am reaching for is that an illness does not make you a broken freak  If you caught the flu would that make you a pariah  Don't think so  So just because you have an illness does not make you a freak  Being mentally ill does not make you an alien among us  It does not mean you should hate yourself  or die  It means you try to find a way to either cure or manage the illness  depending on factors I do not know   Something about New Year  isn't there  I always think I'm going to struggle with Christmas  congratulate myself for getting through that  then wham  Why  I've never really bothered with NY   don't party  don't do resolutions or anything like that  Try to convince myself it's just another day  Yet  like you  and several others  I'm here with the demons in my head  I guess we have to tell ourselves nothing has changed  climb back out of the pit again  etc   Tiring and tiresome though  Hope you're ok  Just know you're not alone  X I decided to play 18 pill cocktail  And apparently I'm a horse because that didn't do it  I used to experiment with drugs but not to that extent   Yes of course  sorry for late reply   got in shower as soon as I posted that  Ask PM away  Yes  all the time    I used to play WoW    a long time ago XD  I currently play Final Fantasy 14  and I'm loving it  I've played Diablo 3 a lot as well  Titanfall 2 is freaking awesome  If you haven't played it yet  I highly suggest it   Dont give up man  there's always hope  maybe not today  but eventually  if you make the right choices  someday it will be different   OK  so not a psychopath   Good    Possibly schizoid personality disorder    and probably undertreated    An indeterminate diagnose and undertreatment   Like getting an infection and telling you to brush your teeth   Great   I'm glad you are being authentic and unfiltered   You got nothing to lose  right   Let's tear you apart and see what you got   Sometimes the best time to begin to fix something is when it is all out in the open   A car  for example  has a great deal of complexity   It is hidden beneath a body of metal   It isn't easy to diagnose or fix just by looking at the outside   One must be meticulous and systematic to fix a car    once one gets under the hood   You are even more complex than a car   To your point  you fix one thing  there is something else to fix   In fact  it is illogical to try to fix it all at once overnight and hope that it will all be better   Having said that  you can systematically make improvements across many variables   You may have tried all that you can think of    that I have no doubt  but have you tried things others can think of   Not just the healthcare professionals    the quality of mental health care can vary greatly by geography   Furthermore the variabilities of each case  of each body  takes a lot of tinkering   Medication is not a magic bullet    and it takes a lot of adjustment in coordination with other modalities for mental healthcare to succeed   Again  it is rarely overnight   I will share with you  that for many people  sharing what is going inside is a huge challenge   Especially for men of certain geographies and generations where "being a man" is to almost deny emotions as vulnerability   It becomes especially hard when there are few role models for successfully expressing emotions   It isn't surprising that that people who have a hard time communicating feelings to others can feel isolated and awkward   I will say  that you can learn   Being able to be social and functional makes employment easier   Employment and frugality can make living easier   Having your shit together can make dating easier   There is an old psych "concept" that basically says  that one cannot successfully have a relationship if one has issues with oneself   I'm oversimplifying  but you may get the point    Man  sounds like a bad time   Bad situations can be such a hard thing to get through    but you make it sound like there is something more I don't know  I don't know what you are actually suffering with  or if it is curable  I am not trained to understand that sort of thing  all I try to do is offer understanding and a friendly ear  I would think that if you have been in therapy it is reasonable to deduce that therapy can help with whatever you are dealing with       If you are acting in a way that is dangerous to yourself or others  then it might be necessary to take quick action  Otherwise  it is reasonable to allow time for the therapy or subsequent medical treatment to bear fruit  Is it actually possible that whatever ails you is manageable or curable   how old is your daughter   It sounds like you got a lot going on   Here to be supportive      nah man its good Hey  wo man  ftm or mtf   I know what you're going through  I'm going throuugh the same exept that I'm just in secondary school so I don't have a job  If you need someone to talk to  feel free to PM me  I'll be here for you  Hang in there friend  nice weather today eh  So so sorry that you feel so bad  Life is tough enough without unwarranted criticism  Perhaps you are around perfectionists   studies show that many people with depression are perfectionists   Clearly  from your post  you are intelligent and articulate  Is there anyone who can give you some support  And positive constructive help  Have you been able to talk to a doctor  Do you have access to a counsellor   Please know you are not alone  Get to the Emergency hospital if you have nowhere else   And if you want to talk  I'm here  X We cannot choose how others respond to us    however we can change our response  If these are why you want to kill yourself I would ask you to wait it out  See what you can change   think of it as a challenge  There are so many options other than kill yourself  It's actually been rainy where i live sadly wbu Like I said bold statement  I went to two separate institutions this semester  I never say it's going to get better because I don't think that my situation will  I only try to get people laugh at their situation because life's a fucking bitch and it's hilarious  Get off the Internet  and go meet people  You can still function if you hate yourself  me to From experience  I know three month olds can be exhausting   Your GF may also feel exhausted   Everyone feels like being a parent is easy  but loving and caring for kids is work   More work than people usually imagine     As a parent  a father   the skill you need to practice is patience   Patience to not have things go immediately as expected   Patience to put up with crying and tantrums and all the other stressors   Patience and parenting tactics   For your daughter  it may be singing or rocking or a bottle or swaddling  or simply letting a baby cry   They have no language    crying is just it     I suspect that there is more than how to soothe a crying child    People do give a shit    and not everyone wants money   I thought about getting titan fall 2   Looks kind of insane to follow   Its pretty sunny outside  What are u doing  I got that one too Like I said  you have to ask for help  It would have to be very extreme for them to forcibly send you to rehab  something in pretty sure they can't do if your over 18  Just come clean to them that you want help  you don't have to say everything to them  Your family cares about you and will always be there if you ask for them  Me too  Just laying here on youtube wbu  Peace be with you  man  Just laying down on a sunbed chillin on a boat  Gonna go diving soon  That sounds fun  Sorry for your loss    If there's anything I can do for you  just let me know  What kind of videos are you watching  Fellow INFP here  When I took the personality test  it explained a lot about me that I had never been able to put into words  Wow  you got a lot on your plate    and it sounds familiar      It does seem that your anxiety and depression are a natural consequence of some really tough situations   You've been burdened   Please know that committing suicide would just pass the burden to others   There is no way to fix the past   Losing loved ones    one through suicide and one through romantic betrayal    well in some ways  you may feel rightfully abandoned   I can't even imagine how you feel   You can make improvements to help yourself though    I wish that there were some magic that we could use  but all we could do is provide support   We are here  Sorry for the delayed response  but thank you  I have looked into dermatologists and agree that they seem pricey  but can't work out if how the local ones even do scar treatment of this type  Nonetheless  due to the costs involved it is unlikely that I will be able to seek such treatment anyway   Do you  however  have any advice with using makeup to cover the scars  I'm male  and as such my experience with makeup has been fairly minimal  and I've no idea how I would hide these scars through makeup  Would the scars being on my leg mean that the makeup would rub into my jeans   fade away  Would it rub away upon contact with other surfaces   people  Is it possible to apply something quickly that I could use in stealthy situations where I may need to quickly cover my scar in the knowledge that somebody might be about to see my leg  And  although I'm aware this is likely futile  are there any waterproof options for  say  when I go to the beach or am out on a warm  sweaty day  Thank you  Do you know anything about lemon juice working after the scars have been there a couple of months  or why this works  Thank you for your advice nonetheless  I appreciate it  I haven't heard of anybody else writing things with scars  this is slightly reassuring to hear  thank you  Unfortunately  and somewhat ironically  I've never been a fan of things like tattoos that leave a permanent mark on my body  so this is tricky  And due to the size of the scar in question  I don't know how I could subtly cover it up with a marker or something similar  But I appreciate the advice  and will continue to keep it in mind nonetheless  Sorry for the delayed response Hey  HNY I'm hearing what you're saying and I can understand how tough that must be  You are such a strong person for everything you've gone through   I remember when a family friend of mine killed herself at 16  I remember her family and how it affected them  I cried for them and I hurt for you know because I've seen families go through it  I'm so sorry for your loss   Depression and anxiety is such a hard obstacle of life and I'm so sorry you're in this tangled web too   Well it is new year so this might be a good time for change I don't know how to give you fix it advise but I will tell you that your life is a priority and your opportunity for happiness is not an option  No you don't need someone to complete you  but I can understand your pain in what you've gone through  But you need to make yourself a priority and start figuring out what is going to work for you  Btw I'm 20 too  And I also deal with depression  Don't give up on yourself please I'm rooting for you  3 Find a better reason to live than the life you have  What really brings you joy   Hey  I do not agree with your decision  but I do agree that you deserve calm in your life     Talking can be very calming    venting can be cathartic   Writing can help us sort out the myriad and overwhelming complexities of emotions that plague us   Oftentimes these emotions are all jumbled and contradictory and just so  so  so confusing   So hard to articulate   So awkward and embarrassing that it becomes frustrating and alienating   Makes us want to scream in pain   I can't imagine the hardness of life you have endured   I can't speak to save your or provide a solution    nor do I think you are asking for advice   I think you just want to be heard and metaphorically held and hugged   We are here to help   If you want to chat    we are here to listen and support Hi  sorry for the delayed response  What do you mean by "while it's healing"  I feel like it healed awhile ago  and is now just taking a long time to fade away  Does this still count as part of the healing process  and if so  will such creams help still   I recognise that the scars can be seen as battle scars and such  and with that in mind  I really don't mind the smaller scars on my legs  But the big one  my ex girlfriend's name in large letters  is much harder one to brush away  and is a very vivid reminder  I don't know how I could deal with somebody asking about that one   Thank you for your other advice though  it's reassuring and helpful to hear that I was just using it to cope rather than because I am weak  That's certainly not something I find easy to believe a lot of the time  I've saved your comment and will look back on it as a frequent reminder  Thank you  Hi  thank you very much for your response  sorry for my delayed reply  Do you know of any such lotions   creams etc  And I feel like my scars have already "healed"  and are now just fading away slowly  Do you know if that counts as part of the "healing process"  and will such medicine   creams still help if they are in this stage  Thank you again As someone who was in your shoes about a year ago  it gets better  Every morning  she was the first thing on my mind   until one morning  I thought about something else  As the weeks went by  I still thought about her  but it didn't stop me from living like it did before  It stopped consuming all my thoughts  I grew to accept it  and if I really love her  which I do   I want her to be happy  so I still keep her in my heart and good wishes  but I know something out there will be make me happier  Now I know what love is  and will know when I find it again  I hope that made some sense  If you need to talk or want advise or anything  feel free to talk  I've been there Don't let one person drag you down and get you in a rut       I always tell others in a similar spot how I felt the same way after my first breakup but now I'm actually very greatful it happened  It gave me time to focus on improving myself and developing new friends that I had neglected  Now I recognize that the relationship wouldn't have worked out and that my new girlfriend is a much better fit for me  There is some tattoo cover up by Kat Von D that is supposed to work really well  If your cuts are healed you can use liquid concealer and then dust some foundation over it  Youll want a shade that matches your skin tone or a tone darker  If their fresher you can always cover with a bandage and come up with a cover story  Personally for me ive found the best cover is honesty  I dont really care if my scars are in the open or not  I figure we all have them and mine tell a story   Thanks    I got his last letter about a day before I learned of his passing  He was sick but I thought he was going to make it  Just kind of bummed that I wont be getting anymore letters   My 24 year old friend is still a sophomore  and he's the smartest guy I know in a group of intellectuals  So that better not weigh in your mind  I flunked out firat semester because of the como of an unclear breakup  and emotional abuse  instability  and confusion  4yrs later  lots has changed and I'm still afraid of trying school again  This is all to say you're on a good path   Even if you don't go back to school  it's the college try that counts    Normal is an illusion from youth and what overprivileged people project  Lots to say about all this  Remember that life is about being with people and animals as much as possible  Want everything to go forwards more smoothly  I don't know much about metabolism  but I eat constantly for comfort  no carbs tho  and feel good about it  I recommend roasted squash  anyway you do it  ultimate comfort   I just remembered that for one whole year I'd covered my large 2sink mirror with a bedsheet  Because of something completely different that I guess made sense to my parents  I think I was wasting whole days staring at myself  trying to understand who I am underneath all of this  Old photos have proved better at that  but I understand if that would be painful   It was made very clear to me when I was on fluvoxamine  lithium  and clonidine  that medication is all about trial and error  that you have to make clear to your therapist that you don't feel less a risk to yourself than before  and that you need to try something else  That phrasing is essential  I know 5 people whose loved ones killed themselves  but I always assume they don't want to talk about it  If you ever want to talk about it  there are people like me who want to hear  so as to understand    Also vital is the love and embrace of life over the fear of death  Death can make everything that doesn't fail in life a miracle  Of course there are a lot of steps within a positive mindset to get out of anxiety and depression  and I'm not an expert  It's been over 2 years since I had month long darkness immobility spells  the life long goals I've revived help me see light  So  talk to people who are affected similarly   How has your relationship with your dad been awful  I'm gonna look at your history for clarity  but it seemed him kicking you oit was out of immense love  Thay's a big thing that rescued me from scary rage spells  is trying to take a lot of what people do as out of love  And you have control of you're life  you have moved significantly forward in life  and ever moving forward is significant hard work     I'm glad you didn't do it  Having things to look forward too is very good   Thanks  It sucks quite a bit  that's for sure  I really am glad you didn't go through with it  If you ever want to talk  I'm here for you  Fair warning  I am not very good with social things  I guess   That's what Dr  Kevorkian thought  He helped people kill themselves   Assisted suicide   If someone wanted to die  why let them suffer by being alive  He helped them do what they wanted to do  oh  honey  how much time do you have  LOL  Of course there's more  one can't get to this point without there being a shitload of stuff that goes with   just happy to hear from someone  I guess I'm not alone  Thank you so much for the quick advice  I will look into these and see what I can do  Is concealer   foundation etc typically waterproof or will it rub onto clothes  furniture etc   I don't mind most of my scars  but the big one  my ex's name in big letters  is a very hard one to brush aside  and I fear will make people far more uncomfortable around me  My other scars tell a story  faded quicker  are easier to explain or brush aside  and I know I don't need to explain them if I don't want to  But this particular scar is very alarming  very hard to ignore  and when I meet someone else  likely very off putting  I know I'd be very uncomfortable dating someone with another person's name scarred into themselves  no matter how accepting I am of the historical reasons  Maybe that's just me  Hi  I hope you're feeling better  The reason I think you need to tell a therapist is because you said    I've been suicidal or had suicidal thoughts everyday for about 5 6 years   You are a minor and it is NOT normal to feel this way  It is not your fault that you feel this way  You may have a treatable mental illness like depression  after you treat it  you will feel better  see things more clearly and understand that suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem  Don't try to cope in silence  you have resources available to help you get through this  please reach out and let them help you  Esports  CS GO is the way to go FeelsGoodMan To the guys sending me messages I'm heading to bed right now  but I really would like to speak with you tomorrow  It is very hard right now  I have my submissions this week and haven't done anything   Even sent a long ass message to my dad and even said this to his face but i don't know why nobody believes in me   Car videos on YouTube  You are not alone   And while I may be sleeping soon  I do have all the time that you'll spare   I am very good at replying within 24 hours  and I am happy to help   It can be such an emotional time of year for people  and I think we can all support each other  yeah I've thought about that   just not sure how much id thrive living in that environment  Please don't do that  What's wrong  How can I help  It's prison  It's not about thriving  its about getting through it and making the best use of your time there that you can  No one thrives in prison  But if you kill yourself you're guaranteeing that you will never have another environment to live in and thrive in after prison  I know you don't want to hear this because you may care deeply about those people  but anyone who can't see past anything superficial like acne scars aren't the kind of people you want to be around  Trust me  you will find good people in the world and they won't care at all about your scars  Your scars are a part of you  They are not ugly or grotesque  they are a memory from a time in your life that shaped you into the person you are today  Do not be ashamed of them  Love them  People who truly wish to be a part of your life will love the whole of you  scars and all   Please know that the feeling goes away    You've experienced a major trauma  It hurts now so  so much  I know  but time dulls the pain  Like a broken bone that didn't heal quite right  it will ache if you press on it  or you bump into something  but most of the time  it'll be as if it isn't even there  I know you can't see that right now  but time will heal you  Therapy will help expedite that process   Consider reaching out to others  Our experiences are all different  but I'm sure you can find someone with whom you can connect  It can be helpful to work through this with someone who you feel understands what you are experiencing  Hey there friend  I care  I feel like I've been in almost the same situation as you  I remember I missed school for like 3 weeks straight because it made me vomit to even think about going  It's been almost a year since then and I graduated just fine  If I can get through it you can    That's rough  man  Sorry about your mom    that's a tough way to grow up  Seems like you learned a lot of important practical skills though  I think that makes you an interesting and well rounded person  I work at a small place too  not very useful for meeting new people  There's always bars and stuff I guess  personally I've had more luck with group exercise classes and going to events like concerts to meet new people  I hope things get better for you soon  you deserve a good relationship  Great  now you're here   I hope you're fucking happy now  Well  if you recognize that you've made poor choices  can you see what would have been a better decision  If so  you very much have the power to change the situation  That means that you are growing  That means you are becoming a better  more experienced  more aware person   Don't let these strangers tell you who YOU are  They don't know you  Their words are empty  devoid of any meaning or power if you realize that it is YOU decides who you are   Who is the kind of person that you want to be  ThatOneDude  What small thing can you do right now to get a little bit closer to that improved version of yourself  Think small  like tidying your room or making a grocery list  PM time I'm at a loss for words   This is the most childish thing I have ever seen  I removed my comment but I'll put it back   Top Fucking Kek  Exact same things happened to me  4 years ago  constantly sceeamed at  isolated  didn't talk to girlfriend for at least a week  months if all the isolated weeks were counted up  tho we used to talk everyday for at least 3hrs even long distance  allowed to pass by my AP teachers b c my mom screamed at them and they didn't want to bother with not letting me pass tho I did the work less frequently than you   My mom went on an ssri and she cries and screams and excalates situations less  If you're going to continue lying to your therapist  tho your mom may not know that  she's still payjng for it  so either abandon the unproductive fear of failure and get a job and pay for it  or realize that like fear  lying gets in the way of progress  There's never a reason to lie  and I used to do it all the time  and that's most of what led to minor traumatic bs  solutions come more quickly if you're assertively honest always   Very important  my situation in school was different than yours  Your teachers seem to care for you   I Care      It's illegal to be discriminated against in the workforce because of your appearance  Are you aware of that  Hey  are you still here with us  I don't care about the dubtrack anymore   I don't care about if everyone forgives me   I don't even care if my life suddenly goes better and everything is perfect for me   All I can think about is everything I've already done  I guess I am childish  Of course you'd laugh  Nobody would care if I died  I came to my senses after I was banned and realized how fucking idiotic I am  I've been like this for a long time  Thank you  I'll try to change  And the last horse crosses the finish line  i relate deeply to how u feel  This is probably the least appropriate  but most effective and important approach  Think about what would happen if you jumped in front of that train and ended up paralyzed  but alive  Say you still feel the same way that you do now  you are miserable  want to die  But you are paralyzed  You cannot move your arms or legs  What will you do then   Does jumping in front of a train still sound like a good idea  I wouldn't risk it  Many  many people live after throwing themselves in front of a train  Some do end up paralyzed because of it   I think maybe you haven't thought this through  I think if you were handed another option  one that involves living  but living without all the emotional pain  that you would take it   The fact that you are angry with these psychologists suggests that you want help  It sounds like you are in a city  If that's true  you know that you can find another psychologist  Approach with this idea  this intention  "I don't want to have to feel like I should kill myself " That is your goal  That and only that  Before you get anywhere else  you need to get to a place where you do not actively want to die   Together  with the right psychologist  you can find out exactly what you need to do to get yourself there  It exists  Even the most suicidal have experienced it  that year or week or day or moment where you WANTED  absolutely WANTED to live  You're capable of returning to it  You just need help finding the path to it  The right psychologist will help you to create the map that you will need to get to where you want to be  Don't do it bro  there's no problem in the world bad enough to end your life  I've been in the Army for 6 yrs and have seen way too many people take this way out  and all it does is pass on their pain to their family  Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem  There are many resources that are available to you tel 1 800 273 8255   No problem  it makes me feel happy to know you're doing better  I personally use some strong liquid foundation to cover up scars and burns on my arm  but I've looked online and apparently stuff like  Judith August  https   judithaugustcosmetics com product category products by skin condition scars   makes concealer just for scars and other skin problems  although it's expensive   There are probably tattoo cover up kits that work very good as well  Scars that are fading are differently healing  and don't put any makeup in an open wound  I don't know if I helped  but best of luck to you and your recovery  22 F here  Major depressive disorder and PTSD  Still occasionally relapse so I don't know how much help I will be  but free to PM if you want  Yes  I think about how those I love will respond to the news  how they will grieve  I wonder if maybe some people I care about but with whom I have no contact will never even find out that I'm gone  I worry that people will blame themselves for not doing something   The truth is that nobody can do anything to help  The decision is mine  But I know the human tendency is to analyze  and try to find that place  that moment  act or omission where the outcome could have been different   I hate to think that my being at peace will come at the expense of the happiness of those I love  I know they will get through it  but I hate to think of them wasting time mourning me   At the same time  it would be nice to know that I was loved maybe more than I believe I am  The knowledge wouldn't change the outcome  but it's always nice to have someone you care about care about you  too  May I ask what's your current financial state  What's your savings and your yearly salary  Have you done any research on Craigslist for any nearby cheap apartments  Tyvm for caring bro  it really makes me feel better    Yes  I get envious when I see that other people have cut deeper or more than I have  have more scars or bigger scars   I haven't self harmed in several months  I stopped trying to keep track because I found myself obsessing over it    and I really miss it at times  It was a huge factor in my life for 10 years  I found that having a puppy really helped me   too  My little fluffybutt was a godsend  That would be difficult to prove  and embarrassing and stressful to confront  I do not believe it is happening at my current job  but it absolutely did at my last one  They were not obvious about it  but it was clear that was the case  It really affected me  communications  when i started school i was interested in journalism but not so much anymore Why would they be looking through your stuff  Were they worried about you and looking for blades or were they just nosy  Also mention to them that they need to know what actually helps and what doesn't  Please don't    and please seek the advice of a medical doctor  You have several symptoms  anxiety  insomnia  etc   that suggests that you have depression  I've been where you are now  and I've learned that these feelings of wanting to die are not necessarily due to any specific life situation  but because my brain isn't releasing enough of the right chemical for me to deal with life's problems  This can't be dealt with by simply removing your problems  or with "good advice" or some new outlook on life    in my experience depression is simply not logical if you're suffering from it    Last year I lost a good friend because he couldn't handle a major depressive episode  MDE   He didn't go see a doctor after a few of us pleaded with him  He didn't get on antidepressants  or therapy  I don't want to lose anyone else  even if you're just a stranger on the internet  Please PM me if you want to talk more       Are you in high school   Yes  In the U S I always imagine everyone there who was trash to me  The thought of people feeling guilty caring about me after I die makes me feel happy I know I can't stop you  so I wish the best of luck in the afterlife  I think it's great that even though you know that your suicide will affect the people mentioned in this obituary  you put in the thought to send your thanks in great detail   Though    you may regret it  I've heard countless amount of times where during mid suicide  the people suddenly start regretting it  I wouldn't try to make your death immediate  because you might regret it at the last second  That's okay  cause I'll be there to support you   I have no savings at all  My bank usually only has a few dollars left in it at the end of the month   I don't know my yearly salary but I make about  1100 a month   after taxes  I posted a Craigslist ad  I'd definitely need another roommate because even studio apartments are  800 or so a month here   I'm behind because i'm not motivated to do the shitloads of work  And because i keep messing up failing assignments  i have to re do them along with whatever new assignments are being handed out  Example  I havent gotten anything other than an F on math assignments because i can never understand what's being taught and dont care enough to try harder anymore  I've been "trying harder" for as long as i can remember  and im fucking done with it  im too stupid to do it and nobody is realizing that  Everything else is just boredom and lack of motivation  Tough shit though  because my teachers don't care what i say  they're still forcing me to do more and more shit  Im not allowed to just take an F on an assignment and be done with it  they want me to keep trying  and it is doing the opposite of what they intend What the fuck  What job do you work  I'm sorry you feel this way  too  I completely  completely understand this feeling   What is it  exactly  that makes you not want to live anymore  Is it your father  Hey friend    what are you up to now   Lemon juice is acidic  a bleaching agent  and a natural exfoliant   If you Google it  there are several websites instructing you on how to apply it     Generally  clean the area  apply lemon juice with a cotton swab 2x daily  stay out of the sun when using it  etc       I'm not a doctor or licensed to dispense any kind of medical advice  so please do your research   good luck    Which subject or subjects are you ok good succeeding at   I'm only passing shop and geography because they're so damn easy to coast through with minimal effort  Ok  so that's not a degree that you'll get out of college and find absolutely no jobs in  There's a wide range of stuff you can do with that degree  I think you're on a better path than you give yourself credit for    I'm sorry you had to go through that  May I suggest you seek s therapist  I see one and it helps  They're specialized in helping with situations like this  Maybe it would help you having someone there to talk to about anything and everything  You don't have to explain the situation to your mom or family if you don't want to  Just ask for a therapist  And your therapist can't tell anyone about that  I'm a manager at a store in a mall  I get paid 20 cents more hourly than my sales associates under me  I also have a bachelor's degree   It's hard finding jobs when you don't have a drivers license  Only things in walking distance are retail or restaurants that pay even less  21 M  I haven't cut in  almost  four years and I  still  pretty much  constantly  feel the urge to cut myself  I'm not sure that urge ever truly goes away per s  it simply gets somewhat easier to avoid doing  One kind of gets used to the urge over time  and therefore it gets easier to ignore    if that makes any sense    Hold hold up  Is this in the U S   at this point it's just hard to have any faith  I'm sure there are professionals out there who I can talk to but in the end I'll still be gay  still be lonely  etc  Medical advice can only go far  If the insomnia was due to some disease  maybe I could just go to a doctor  but it's because of the constant stress and anxiety  And that anxiety and stress is due to other things  that no professional can solve  Maybe I'm just being cynical  maybe that's just how it seems   And I will consider PMing you  thank you     Let's talk  I kind of have my faults and weirdness too  I don't mean to undermine you or anything like that  but I feel fairly similar to you  I'm only in high school but I legitimately have 2 friends  and neither of them have a whole lot in common with me  I've always seen it as whatever because if you want to be cold hearted  you could always just get crazy rich and have an overflowing number of people want to be with you 24 7  even if they are just a bunch of gold diggers  It's weird  I've read a study on why people with "higher IQ" have less friends in comparison to the average  Don't worry dude  I'm kind of in the same boat as you  The only reason I have friends is video games and esports  Haha  Yes  South Carolina  specifically   Hey man  I'm right here  Have at it  tell me anything you feel  You're telling me you're only earning  13 2k a year  which  assuming you work fulltime  is about  2k under the federal minimum wage   That's a fucking joke  If you have any interest in esports  I can try to forward you some jobs in journalism or management  Hey I know you'll still have problems  The thing is that you may need treatment for something so that you can properly DEAL with those problems  You can't do that unless you get professional help   especially if there is a chemical imbalance  Self diagnosing here isn't going to help   Back up 15 years or so when I had my first MDE  A friend went with me to the doctor's  and I started citalopram and therapy  I was dealing with some "insurmountable" issues then as well  GF broke up with me  hated life  etc  One time I didn't sleep for a week  But after I got treatment  within a week or so  I was able to reassess my situation and put some subjectivity to them  Then I worked through the problems  Asked for extensions  started making friends  etc  Fast forward to now  I don't take pills anymore and am grateful for life  Hindsight is always 20 20  but foresight requires that you get help from others with experience   In any case  things get better with time  I know that sounds cliche  but I really believe now that there is always a solution to a problem  no matter how dire things may seem "in the moment"   Also  having dealt with many professors before  edit  now that I AM one  sometimes   most are very supportive with personal issues  They do give extensions  But again  this is a problem that can be worked through once we know our brains are working correctly  I've never played a video game in my life   Minimum wage is 7 25 here  I make more than that  Most stores only pay that much  What is your typical total hours per week  Blepharitis is a common eyelid inflammation that sometimes is associated with a bacterial eye infection  symptoms of dry eyes or certain types of skin conditions such as acne rosacea   Between 38 and 42  Hi  Just writing the note shows that you still have a reason to be alive  There are people that care about you in this life  They're your reason to keep fighting and stay alive   That's pretty    ridiculous  At the bare minimum  I expect  24k to be sustainable living at low class level and you're only earning half of that  What is your education background  Are you currently a student or past college age   Also  have you ever considered trying some shortcuts to save money  For example  buying a gym membership  for showers and etc   Or  if you have a business suit on and you walk into a hotel  they'll sometimes not suspect you and free breakfast is headed your way  before i was diagnosed with depression  i had terrible insomnia and i felt like a zombie every day because of it  me being the idiot that i am started experimenting with some drugs and i ended up making things worse  thats one big fail  after i got experimental with things  i met a girl at a party that i absolutely fell in love with  she actually made me feel special  like i had a place on this earth  like i had a purpose  we dated for awhile and one weekend she just stopped talking to me  then she called me out of nowhere and told me we were done  no explanation or anything  the next day i saw her in school with some guy ive never seen before  and they were kissing  that was another failure    that same girls best friend  we'll call M  was also coincidentally one of my good friends  M took my side on things and hated her friend for playing me like that  long story short  i ruined my ex and M's friendship  and then M and i stopped being friends for awhile  recently  i saw M at a party and talked with her  we caught up and she told me she pushed me away because she started to get feelings for me  naturally  i was interested because M was beautiful girl  and she was always able to make me smile  even after that rough breakup  so M and i got real close and then one day she stopped talking to me too  just like my ex  the one M was friends with   I don't feel like I have a place anymore because I had these things go right for me  and I must've done something dumb to ruin them  I have a bachelor of science in mass communication  I graduated about a year and a half ago    I do virtual transcription to bring in a little more money but it's only enough for bus fare or an extra week of groceries  I used to have an etsy shop but had to close it down when I was homeless couch surfing the last time  February September of 2016   I recommend looking at  r slavelabour and  r forhire in the meantime  Those two have worked wonders for me at times  I used to write academic essays on  r slavelabour  even though it was against the rules  Hah  it's not  don't do it   personally  i dont think its ever the right thing to do  there is always another way You should probably reach out to someone else other than your family and irl friends  and you're doing that right now  Your friends  and me  at  r suicidewatch wouldn't mind listening to your vent  That's the purpose of this subreddit after all   Let me know if you need someone to talk to   i'm here to talk if you need to   I found it very difficult to get the nerve to talk to my parents  but once i did  it got infinitely better  I had to walk into their room bawling my eyes out at 2am to get their attention  But trust me  no matter how hard it might seem  it feels great just getting it out  You don't have anyone you can tell anything to  You can tell me  I'll be up for awhile Because you realize there's something else to live for  and that you just haven't found it yet I hope you wake up tomorrow and find that it's not the day  3 Just PM me if you need anyone to vent  I do agree with a therapist  Medicine is not always reliable  but talking to someone always is the best option  Hell  I love talking to my elders cause they have a lot of wisdom that can guide me through life  No like I literally can't  Fucking survival instincts  Fine I'll wait and do plan b No problem  I hope things work out for you    I'm sure she'll understand  Feel free to PM me or something if you ever need someone or some advice  Damn man  at least tell us why you're doing it  Nah nah nah  Let's talk for a bit  What's up  Don't do it  Things always get better  Have you tried talking with family or friends  Would you consider yourself a loner during your school years  What was your school and home environment like  Therapist  See a therapist ASAP I'll never be anything special or good  Just one of the people who live and die and suffer their way through it so others can feel better about their own situation I wasn't a loner at all  I had  and still do have  amazing friends    I was always a major overachiever in school  to the point where getting B's were unacceptable even with accelerated classes  My family's not perfect  and there's definitely been strife  but we always established that we love each other and will be there if when shit hits the fan   I have no idea why I act this self absorbed and pitiful  since I've had a great life  Do you exercise  Go out for fresh walks in the morning  Maybe talk to the elders at the retirement homes or do some volunteer work  My family is toxic and I have no friends  Well it seems to me u aren't doing the things normal people do to maintain their will to live such as buying a brand new Mercedes Benz with a 10  down payment  You might as well go out with some style  Open 12 different credit cards and get loans from as many different sources as possible and really just bathe in the fruits of life  That should straighten things out  to hell with the psychologists  My career for law enforcement is over before it could start  I have no friends  and the one love for me left me December 20th to "be independent " and blocked me on everything  Toxic family  Just to name a few  I mean I Can help you out money wise og with a place to live  Cause I live in Denmark  But I'm here to talk if you ever need it Well you can make a million friends here on Reddit  This subreddit is meant specifically to help  were all supportive here   How long have you been suicidal  And is there any recent events which made you this way  I don't really exercise  I used to play a lot of sports but it takes too much energy to get out there anymore   And again  I used to do volunteer work but my schedule filled up  But my work is organizing for climate and racial justice  so it's not like I'm not engaging with the world  I'm surprised  Maybe you just need a therapist or someone to talk to  It just seems like you're going through a bipolar esque phase  Hit me up if you need someone to talk to  I'll be on for a little longer  Haha yeah  I've been trying to push myself to see a therapist  but I guess it's hard to take that real first step  Thanks for reaching out to me  though  Dude  the procrastination game is real  It's insane at how we want to do something then 5 minutes later our brain is just like  "eh    maybe another time " days and weeks  maybe even months later and that other time has yet to happen  I don't want support  I want death  I wish to cease existing  This is number 3 being suicidal  The  One  left me on the 20th   Just don't do meth  you will see a change in your life  It's not that life is unfair  you just chose to ruin yours  my friend I was "clean" for about 5 years up until a few months ago  Those 5 years it was hard and many times I was battling myself not to cut Unfortunately I lost the battle and now it's just a matter of beating this addiction again  None of my recent ones have been cuts necessarily just scratches but I know how it starts with me if I don't nip this in the ass now soon I will full on be cutting deep cuts and that's not something I think I can handle again  I think self harming is my biggest addiction and I hate it  I hope you're able to keep "clean" OP because in my experience going back to self harm is something I will forever regret  Good luck   There's nothing to solve  I'm deaf in one ear  my friends belittled me when I shared a personal that was bugging me for 11 years   she left changed her tumblr blog from cute jpop to nsfw showing off her tits and reblogged a 13v tips for being a cum dump  Fuck life  I got my end planned I'm dreadfully sorry for leaving  yesterday  Please tell me you're okay  I had to leave because of some unavoidable circumtances  6 min til psychologist time  Just waiting  It's always the worst  Swallowing pills doesn't hurt Ha  the chance anyone from my city would see my post is pretty small  so I wouldn't actually expect anyone to help in real life ways   It's 3 AM now and I have to be up for work at 8 so I'm considering just staying up and sitting on Reddit  My heart is racing too fast for me to calm down and sleep  Please don't  please just wait a little bit longer for these negative thoughts to go away Hey OP   Firstly I want to say what you're feeling is 100  understandable  and I think I know the root cause of the problem  I want you to hear me out and at least attempt what I'm about to suggest  I am absolutely confident it could help you   it helped me   I went through a rough period in my life about a year ago where I literally saw no purpose from getting out of bed  I saw nothing  No future  No hope  I did nothing  I even stopped playing video games for months  my favourite hobby  For the most part  I sat there and listened to music  responding to the occasional message I got on Steam and then continuing to stare at a blank screen and do nothing  I had every opportunity to open a YouTube tab and watch a documentary or learn something  but there was this    blockade  It felt hard  Something was stopping me   The best description I can think of for this feeling is inactivity  You physically aren't doing anything  A lot of people ask  if you aren't doing anything  how can you be upset  You're not doing anything wrong     When in reality the problem lies within the fact that you are inactive  You're not doing the things you love  For me  this was politics and speaking to people  I hopped on TS this week and spoke to my friends for a few hours and I had a blast  many laughs and smiles  we even played a few games together  I haven't done that in months  I haven't felt genuine happiness in months  either    Another thing is not being rewarded  We  as people  crave recognition  That's true  and it's normal  So I'll start by saying  well done for making it this far  and absolutely well doing for seeking help   that's the first step to fixing the problem  taking inboard advice   To conclude the problem may be that you're not being productive  By not giving your mind something positive and good to feed off  you're allowing it to feed off boredom and defeatism  if you're not careful  it can lead to thoughts like your own  which is a horrible  horrible thing   however it can be fixed     Jake Roper put it really  really well  https   www youtube com watch v 5aZiRrW9KAE  in that video  Watch all of it  it's important you see it  "I have a problem  I need to create things  I don't feel like I'm valuable  I get very sad and I just   I get    a bit depressed " That quote right there probably applies to you   My absolute best advice is be productive  Initiate in things  Make memories  It's so hard  and it will require more willpower than ever before  but it will be worth it   you will lift this blockade   You  and you alone  will break the chains of negativity     Defeatism will not get to you     OP  I am absolutely sure you have so much to live for  You will be someone  you  are  someone  You  can  be productive and you  can  be amazing   I promise you this is temporary   Your pride is forever   Yes   That's the one good thing about New Years  is that it gives a good opportunity for a jumping off point to get help or start moving   Sounds like you got a serious case of girl problems my dude  I am the same  I feel sorry but please just find distractions until you find another girl Recommend watching Louis Rossmann's 2017 video about procrastination  He may be blunt  but it works  I'm heading to bed right now  but I'll be sure to watch that while I'm procrastinating something tomorrow  haha   Thanks again for talking with me  You're probs gonna regret Not getting any sleep  my friend I know I'll regret it but I can't force myself to sleep  I have insomnia even when I'm not stressed out  Yeah  I agree that I'm pretty selfish for contemplating about suicide sometimes  But guess what  we're all selfish  Even the people who you know that don't want you to suicide are selfish for wanting you to continue living with your demons  We're all selfish  but that doesn't mean that we are bad people   Going to link you to something I said earlier  feel like it may help   https   www reddit com r SuicideWatch comments 5lk1pe i am tired and scared dbwbmmu  utm content permalink utm medium user utm source reddit utm name frontpage   You're comparing yourself to successful people  which is true  But think about this  you don't know even a quarter of their story  FDR was a opiate addict in his teens  Jeremy Clarkson got a D on one of his grades and only 1 A  Albert Einstein was told he would amount to nothing at a young age  Winston Churchill was an alcoholic  Joseph Goebbels once said  this  http   www azquotes com picture quotes quote i m so despondent about everything everything i try goes totally wrong there s no escape joseph goebbels 92 7 0728 jpg  in a diary of his  little over a decade later he would be one of the most influential people in the world  No leader  no person in history has ever been successful  Typically  they have had the willpower  strength and resilience to stick around and fight   leading them to a position of success   Intelligence is not cement  Once you've finished with it it can be remoulded  figured and shaped  There is nothing stopping you from learning so much  the entire world is at your fingertips with the internet  Never convince yourself you can't learn  you learn new things every day  make one of those new things a life changing thing  not something that makes you envious  Make people envy you for your ability to learn  your ability to pick things up  while others sit there and refuse to learn  believing intelligence is cement   Would you be open to showing your suicide note  or sections of it    Isn't it interesting how cathartic that is  You start to write  you write all the reasons why  and the more you continue to write  the better you start to feel  and you don't feel as desperate as you had been    Maybe that's a sign you should write  About anything  Maybe others will appreciate it  It could give meaning to your life  to the point that these feelings would gradually diminish   Later  Yeah  I also realized one day that I was contradicting myself  I wanted to be alone yet I didn't want to be lonely  I have legitimately tried to make some more friends at college  but I realize halfway along a conversation that I really don't have any interest in the trivial topics that they talk about  My goal right now is to find someone who is on the same wavelength as me and understands me  but I really don't know if I'll ever find that person   Well then you don't really have a choice  I guess  So What are you up to at 3AM   Btw  if you want the conversation another place  just tell me Message me your info  Would help me out a lot   Hey  I got 3 F's  4 or 5 D's  and dropped a class while in high school  Don't sweat it too much  Worst case scenario  you don't go to a super elite  super expensive school  Maybe you'll go to a community college  It's not that bad  I'm at a community college with plans to transfer to some of the top engineering schools in the country  UC Davis  Santa Barbara  etc     My uncle is a successful lawyer raking in six figures every year  He went to some little state school with a 70  acceptance rate that didn't exist in rankings and nobody had ever heard of it  My cousin has been jumping from college to college getting caught up with drug charges and failing grades and now he's finally settled at a community college at the tender age of 24  Doesn't matter where you get the degree  it's how you use it that counts   Being bad at high school doesn't mean you're stupid  it means you're bad at a school system that's pretty awful  You're not great at following  their  rules  but guess what  All the best people were rule breakers  I couldn't stand high school and skipped straight to college after junior year was over  I'm in California   It's fucking stupid  I got in trouble for doing notes wrong  Like how do you take notes wrong  Point is  you're not stupid or doomed to be a failure  Hang in there  you'll be free soon  And little secret for you  coming from a person who attended a high school where 6 people were accepted to MIT and 2 to Harvard in the same year  those whiz kids peak in high school  They're getting destroyed in college  Yes  they're smart and talented  but they're having their souls crushed by these elite schools  There's always going to be someone better than you at something  Just kill it being you  make the world a better place even if it's just something small like smiling at a stranger who looks sad  It's hard to change the world  but it's easy to change one person's world   It takes a lot of inner strength to label yourself as pathetic  Its ironic  It's one of the harshest words in our language  one of the cruelest things to call someone  It took me a while to admit that I am pathetic  I'm certainly a failure  Helpless and hopeless  So true  I mean one thing is getting people in your life  but when you gotta find friends  It's gotta be someone you click with and that makes it 10 times more difficult  Flashbacks and constant depression and suicidal feelings after several months are pretty much diagnostic of PTSD      Ordinary trauma gets better with time without professional intervention  though that may help      PTSD is different   It may very slowly get better on its own  but you can't count on that    Does it seem to be getting better  or worse    Another very common pattern is that it seems to get better  then one day  maybe several years later  you get triggered badly and it all comes back again at full strength or worse      You don't have a lot of options here   Your friends might be very supportive  but that is not the case for many peoples' friends   The biggest problem is that they don't know how to be supportive  and often they lack the capacity to learn      Another super common problem is that often they can't be trusted to be discreet   That is a huge problem for a girl of your age  but it is a lot worse for a boy and a lot worse at school       What you are going to end up with is a therapist who specialises in PTSD and sexual trauma   These are very expensive people even if they work on a sliding scale  and you need a lot of their time   The longer you leave it the worse condition you are digging yourself into   People delay sometimes for years or more   But that is a waste of your life   You can have a good life   You won't be the same as if it had not happened and you will not be able to start getting better until you accept that   The other thing you will need to get treatment is to accept that you need to tell your parents you need psychiatric help   Normally you would be silly not to tell them why  but you know your situation best   Discuss confidentiality with every professional you meet  it is normally done at the start of the relationship      All of this stuff is super ordinary  there is nothing unusual about these    I want to die   Depressed  Sad  Hurt  Pathetic  Feeling worthless    I "can't" tell anybody     That's the step that will take a huge weight off you when you take it        You can't undo the past but you can move forward  repair some of the damage  learn to cope with some  and build a new life   People do it  tens of thousands of them   You aren't exactly the first person to get raped  or the first guy     We have a few subs that can help you    RapeCounselling   Rape  note there is a separate men's section though it does not get much use  most guys may just use the general sub   There is also a private sub you have to request access to     PTSD   Depression    I can use Skype chat or voice   If you are not yet up to voice  make it a goal to work towards     Wanna talk sometime  Sorry for the late reply  Don't worry though  I'll be there for ya  Thank you and please message me   You need to talk to a therapist who will help you process and come to terms with what happened  You should NEVER blame yourself for something like this  How about doing something activity based  like volunteering  you can look for opportunities at http   volunteermatch org if you need help with that   or something else  http   meetup com might be useful as far as this goes  If you are in school  maybe check out clubs and organizations you might be interested in as well  If you go to church  there might be groups or volunteer service activities available to you too    Doing something activity based puts the focus on service and or doing something you enjoy  so you might either find people who share the same kind of interests and or be so focused on what you're doing or enjoying that you aren't so caught up with whether or not you feel you are making friends or not     Maybe it's more natural that way  and getting out of the house and doing something can be more uplifiting and healthy than being inside and isolated all the time     Finally  if you ever feel like there is no one you can turn to  one thing I've used myself is some of the services at http   yourlifeyourvoice org     Why you are posting this at suicidewatch is something maybe only you can really figure out  but maybe talking with someone who is trained to speak with someone who might have suicidal thoughts or even just be feeling down for whatever reason might be a big help  That last site I linked to has that resource  and if you look at the sidebar here on suicidewatch  there is a directory of other voice chat text hotline services you might be interested in checking out too    No shame in talking to a counselor that way  or at school  or seeking one out  or a therapist on your own  Or you might look at the following site for other ways you can get help  http   greatist com grow resources when you can not afford therapy   Maybe it starts with getting out of the house  serving or enjoying yourself or whatever  but in any case  there is help out there if you need it  Don't hesitate ever to seek it out    And please do not be unkind to yourself  You are valuable  priceless  always  All may be well in the end  if it's not well  it's not yet the end     God bless you and peace be with you  Thanks and I hope I've helped   Technically it might have been your fault  partly   But it was Also other People's fault  But Then again  you didn't put the rope around his neck  you just didn't remove it either  Do you ever feel so sad your teeth hurt  I feel like maybe if I died my friends would be happy  They hate me   It is funny when I bleed and bleed  It is funny   Well schools here don't have that  there's No social activities    I'm new to Reddit  Also  Because I'm going to kill myself for sure  But that's Not my problem  my problem is that I feel something that I have never felt before  for some reason  now  It's just weird  and Maybe someone had answers as to why that feeling just suddenly popped up out of nowhere I know I'm stupid  I know I'm an idiot but will you be my friend  Imagine yourself in the ICU with a broken spine and may other broken bones  Brain damage  Over time you would heal  but that path is one of extreme suffering  You can take yourself to the ER rather than by ambulance  Explain to the staff your feelings  It is a process  but it is necessary  And it provides relief   I will be your friend for now if it helps   I'm here If It's meant to be  It's gonna happen I guess There isn't a way for them to track you  i asked this question when I called  This was the main one  national suicide prevention   But that's not to say they don't have a basic caller ID and can forward that to the authorities   I'm mostly a metal fan  I've been listening to alot  and writing a bit  of depressive black metal lately  for obvious reasons  It sort of helps me cope  Listening to it does mean I tend to wallow in my self pity alot though  which is a problem in it's own right  Thy Light is one band I really identify with  The song  "Wanderer of Solitude"  https   www youtube com watch v k EKG0K4qCs ab channel chrismurray  really expresses the bitter sweet nature of depression for me really well  I've listened to that album so much lately I can't even tell you  Total knockout in my opinion  Why do you hate me Hey  buddy  I just read through a couple of your posts and damn  they hit me hard  I really relate to some of your struggles  Like you  I've always had trouble with school   I know how frustrating it gets when you keep trying over and over  and end up having nothing to show for it  I won't lie  it took me until I was 22 to get my life even a  tiny bit  together  Depression is a bitch  but I fight it every day  and I think you can  too  I know you probably don't feel it  but you're so fucking young  And the fact that you even made it into any college proves that you're smart  I hope you are able to hold on  because the way I see it  that's all life is  holding on  You make a very interesting point  when you refer to the "economics" of suicide and why society frowns upon it  Makes a lot of sense  Especially in this modern age when people are reduced to consumers  At least in this culture  America    Im sorry for all you have endured to male u feel this way  I can only hope u feel the sun once more in the morning and many mornings to come  If you've no one to think well of you  only disappointment and defat what does one have for motivation   If you actually are going to suicide  leave a note to the people that you care about most  I don't think you should put jokes in there because it is supposed to be a serious thing  You don't want people laughing at a suicide note  Also I suggest that you make your note emotionally deep   EDIT  Spelling Reddit I'm going to be blunt  there is absolutely 0 ways to make this happen unless you've been disowned or something  When you say voices  could you elaborate  Could be a mental illness  If you can't be convinced not to  I'd tell you to write it as you'd like to be remembered  If you were funny then throw in some jokes  if you hate everything make it somber  This will be the last piece that anyone will remember of you  the best way is to not kill yourself  losing a child is an unbearable hole in your heart forever  if you can't stay alive for yourself  stay alive for those who love you And i read some of your first posts  I too was kicked out of school  Because I was sad  burdened  felt alone  depressed  I didnt fully comprehend it all at the time  I remembr getting the letter and my whole family seeing it  The fucn feels from that day  I had lied to them  Lied to ppl  About it all  I felt like a failure too lol   Ive been in toxic relationships too  That didnt help  I have a loving family  but my mother and father dont know when to be a friend  more than a parent  And it was detrimental to me and my other younger sister  These days im way better  still struggling but not as hard emotionally  I think thats the case because I know exactly what it was like to feel like conplete shit   I remembr the day about my crazy ex too  The day i paid for an abortion and i didnt even know if the baby was mine or the dude she was with right after me    I was at walmart  couldnt believe what i put myself in  That burdened me too     All the stuff i put myself thru was mainly because my life was under the microscope at the time by my family  Yet i wanted freedom to find out shit on my own   I needed to go thru all that  I couldnt be naive any more  I was naive  dumb when it came to life  and self centered people    Im preparing a life for myself now  Still ups and downs  Still there  but even after fucn failing spectacularly in university after i transferred   i have 2 yr degree   and getting all the shit ive done theown in my face and looking at peers who accomplished what i didnt  I still trudge on   I was homeless too   My credit fucked up  i have  130 dollars in my Chase accnt lmao  Bills backed up   license suspended   but i dont throw in the towel  I dont throw it in because i know I deserve better for all the shit ive already experienced  And i dont want to give up because of that   I just happened to be in this sub and wanted to tell u this  Because reading it sounds like what i went thru for a few years  yours might be a bit worse  but i dont think your story is finished just yet  But my family knows me  and they would like the joke  Suicide isn't always a bad thing  you know Penis jokes it is How do you feel  Hey  I have seen your posts and noticed that you haven't posted in a while  Are you okay  As a fellow teenage girl I truly hope you are okay and that you are somewhere safe now  pm me if you ever need to talk  Always  This time I haven't done it for one month  today actually  and I miss it  A while back I was clean for about four years  and I still missed it all the same then too  I don't think that ever goes away    Also  dogs are the best  My puppy makes me so happy  they really help   I've been clean for awhile  idk really how to explain how it happened or if the way it happened was even good  Wouldn't even consider myself depressed anymore  I'm just living  I miss it a little sometimes when I look at my scars or if I'm feeling like doing something bad  like a dark pleasure or something  I still havent tho It will change how they see you  It tends to go two ways either they sort of become your carers and want to help look after you they see you as fragile and will support you and really try to get you help  the relationship changes and it's hard to go back once you have stopped and are well again because you can stop with the help and support  Or they become more distant this can be really difficult and have a huge impact on you mental health  Where are you in the world  As there are lots of really good mental health team out there  Pm if you need to i have been where you are   I ended two years of feeling like I was being kept in cold storage   Now I am less alone  and growing a bit more as a person  I haven't been disowned but I have disappointed my mom so many times that I hope she has already given up on me You there  Yes  21F  feel free to message me or w e  I'll try my best  hmm   well i would say i have become more comfortable with myself  so there is that plus  but really not much else  Survived a year i think  without actually attempting or going into IP  I know but its supposed to be serious in my opinion  If you love someone and they love you back why suicide  You at least got someone  I'm here for you buddy  you may feel like a monster but you have to grow from past experiences to get anywhere in life  though i fear it's too late for me   Better to try to be the best from now on than to avoid responsibility by killing yourself I am guilty of many things and I think I could do some really bad thing in my future if I don't stop this process of thoughts     There are two things  sin and repentance  Sin is a wound  repentance is a medicine   Just as there are for the body wounds and medicines  so for the soul are sins and repentance  However  sin has the shame  and repentance possesses the courage  So find your courage and live Do something with your life prove that you are not that man     I will recommend you this anime Please watch it  Rurouni Kenshin Hi  thank you so much  Thinking about people that care about me is pretty much the thing that keeps me going  Cause people aren't a solution  Thanks    And MtF though I feel like I have always been a woman  Sorry for the delay  I work 12 hour shifts and am currently on night shift  I read and promise I will respond here soon  I just got off a crazy shift at work  12 hour shifts and I am currently on night shift  and didn't get but one quick lunch break   Also I have my BME last spring so I have learned how to play all of them  although violin is my principle with percussion being my secondary  voice being my tertiary  and alto sax  piano  guitar being my next in line there  You find geography easy  I don't know what Shop is so forgive my ignorance  but going back to geography    do you find it interesting  It's not usually an 'easy' subject   You sound like an intelligent capable person  If you can talk to a good school counsellor then do it   Another method of organising your work   place the books  files  etc for each subject in a separate pile   Then place each pile in order  from easy to hard  so start with shop  geography  etc  Take a piece of paper for each subject  make a list of homework  projects  tasks that need doing and put that on the relevant pile  Any 'Up to date' subjects piles move or put on shelf or file  Congratulate yourself   Now look at the piles remaining and see if you can tackle the one with the least work to do  Think of a reward if you manage it   game of football  trip to coffee shop  Ideally something that gets you into fresh air   Look at the next pile and see if you can do some or all of the items listed  Break things down into small manageable chunks  Just clarifying what needs to be done can help sometimes   And ultimately  there are loads of other options for learning  Evening classes  apprenticeships  etc   Have a go if you feel up to it  Good luck Just curious  but what is your reason for suicide  Yesh of course   whatever you did is behind you right now  it's a good thing no physical harm was done  care to elaborate some more  Talk to him about it  I remember it was a bitch coming forward to my mother about my self harming  had to do it in front of my therapist because I was so nervous  The fact that he teared up as you did it means that he's genuinely worried about what you're doing to yourself  I might recommend talking to him about it with a therapist present  They can give you the confidence you might need to talk it out  If you can't get or don't want to do it with someone else present  sit him down in private and let your thoughts out  There are no wrong words in events like this  and given his reaction I'm extremely doubtful that he'll "blow up " so to speak I empathize with you entirely  I myself have gone through similar emotions   But here is a counter point  I think it's an   extremely healthy   sign that you feel wretched seeing the state of affairs in India and also at the challenges you face in life  If people didn't feel wretched about their shitty personal and social environments  then nothing would ever change  There will be no human progress  I marvel at Indians who think that India is doing "just fine"  It clearly is not  And those who can't see that are either cowards who fear to face the truth so that they can stay in their comfortable bubble of delusions  or mere fools whose imaginations and intellects are crippled forever by their steady diet of bullshit   So you feel wretched  The question then arises  what is the most appropriate response  It's helpful to remember here that you're above all  a human  Humans are born fighters and survivors  You are alive today because your ancestors going back to millions of years fought the terrors of nature every bit of the way and eventually made her their bitch  It's not for nothing that we dominate every other species on this planet  Look at what our dreadfully powerful intellects have achieved  we tamed hunger and now we eat anything we please  we explored reality and are now we're sending furniture to other planets  we studied nature and now  if we so wish  can cover her with a sheet of glass in an instant     I propose that you appeal to this warrior instinct in you  Rouse yourself into action and summoning all the powers of intellect  reason and determination  but  also  compassion and a   sense of duty   to yourself and others  fight  There is no defeat in this war  only glory  Just waking up for work dreading going in i live at home with my mom  just the issue left for now  Because fucking contrast  The color of red blood on white is fucking beautiful  My favorite thing in the world is blood on snow  That's a shame  Is there much music in your area   These series of exams might be a major factor that will dictate your future but remember that you are the one in charge  Strive hard to study for them but not to the point where you stress yourself out  In the end  they're merely a set of questions to measure how much you learn   If you are determined to pass ace these exams  it is better to have a study plan that would work for you  Try to enjoy while studying  A quick Google search will give you some fun ideas   I wish you well  please don't give up  There's a whole lot of things that wait for you after you get past your exams   If you want to talk  you can PM me     You may be now  but you can learn for free online and a get a job after you've built a few things   Lots of different things I find it so hard to study  whenever I sit down to do it  I just get overwhelmed by all that I have to do that I just give up  its a vicious cycle and it on top of everything else in my life is killing me  I love your ending  I feel over burdened when I look at the amount of shit I have to learn only to forget a year after the exam   I feel like that all the time  just plain simple inadequacy  I stopped for my girlfriend   Yeah self harm helps   Of course it does    But I had to at least try something else  I know exactly what you mean  It happens to me sometimes too  On top of that I happen to be a big procrastinator too  What worked for me last time it happened was separating everything  And while I was working on one I completely forgot about the rest  I realized when I thought about it as a whole I kinda shutdown  but when I broke it down and just tried too forget the rest I was able too accomplish more  Do you have any tips on doing that  I dont seem to be able to  Wishing you strength  I hope you find solice in this  Take one step at a time  Don't overthink about how much work you still need to accomplish  Focus on what you have to do for the time being  maybe set a schedule  Don't pressure yourself into thinking how much more you have to do  Also  you need to at least lessen procrastination  If you don't then that's good but don't forget that having a lil bit of fun here and there isn't bad    Regarding with "everything else in your life"  well yes it's really hard to juggle schoolwork with other stuff  If you need help  don't be afraid to approach your parents  friends  You can also reach out for a professional help if yoh think you need to   What is the method you have chosen  I think being MtF sucks so much more than rhe other way around  Wish I could make it easier for you  And as I'm FtM  I have always felt like a guy   Those night shifts must be heavy  Good luck  And eventually you'll get to be who you are  and until that time you can escape reality on internet  I wish you so much strength  Hang in there girl  3  One was expanding my social comfort zones    I tried this  It made me feel absolutely terrified and I retreated    but prayer gave me peace  I don't believe in any of that  Each to their own    What will you do then   Nothing more of less than what I do now  Just hope to die and cry all day  Just without use of some limbs    you want help   Yes  Desperately  But nobody will give it to me    you can find another psychologist    In the UK  you need to be referred to one if you don't want  to pay  or like me  don't have th money   So no  I cannot    Together  with the right psychologist   None will accept me though  What really brings you joy   Nothing I know of I've tried for years  Why should I believe that the future will be different   Unless  of course  you want someone to take action    I do  I don't care what it is  but it'll be one last cry for help before silence  OP complains that everyone is fake as shit and you suggest he lie to a shrink  Does that seem wise  I don't really enjoy anything  so I don't have anything to spend money on  so no reason to get loans or whatever  Since you have a lot of time until the tests  I would basically set a schedule  Say you have a math  science  and history tests  For one week I'd focus on math  the next science  and then history the next  Then on the 4 week review everything  And if your a procrastinator like me it'd be best too set a time your going to study each time like7pm 9pm  With some breaks in between  I usually need a bunch of breaks to stay focused  Anyway I hope this helps alittle  I don't always follow it perfectly but doing stuff like this helps me more then if I didn't  Yo  here for you pm  Sounds like you need to resolve this  badly  Self harming is providing a release for something you should be dealing with  You got a community here to support you  but you need to recognise this and start being you again  It sounds like it's time to find out    we here I could help u find ways to solve those problems if you'd like It fucking hurts when you wake up the next morning when you've survived  Which is extremely common  might I add  Suicide by pill overdose has a 2  success rate   all the other times people wake up  usually covered in their own vomit and having damaged their liver  Nah  It's cool  I made my decision  I survived it  so Yea  I know  But then just take enough of the right thing Woah  very cool that you're a musician  I'm much more conservative in what I listen to but agree with you on Strauss  Wagner  and Britten  I'm hoping to see a full production of the Ring at some point  I should put my name on the waiting list for Bayreuth   I appreciated our little chat a lot  It helped  so thank you for that  I am in the US  but cinnamon buns are great so I'll think of this next time    D Thank you  I was very lucky  It was my drug tolerance that saved my life  I will certainly be fighting to be better this year   Well I wish you peace my friend Thank you  I know it's not going to be easy  but I have more motivation now than before and we all must start with a step   Thank you  I'm trying to do that and trying to learn exactly who is important to me  Part of that night was in no small part to one of my family members really laying into me verbally and making me feel alone and unloved  I need to figure out what I need out of these relationships too  I hope 2017 is a good year for all of us   That's how I picture it too That's a start  Find something that makes you happy  It is hard to find happiness when you're in such a dark place but something like community service or volunteering elsewhere might make you feel good inside  You matter  Your effort matters  Trust me  Helping others makes me feel incredible  You learn from people who are in a worse place than you are  It makes you feel like you're not alone but it also makes you see you aren't in such a bad place  Help yourself to what life has to offer  Be selfish  Take care of yourself  You were put on this earth for a reason  And if you feel you have no reason to live  find a reason to die proud someday  Because of the difference you made in the world  Every little bit counts   I get it    you feel ashamed that you rejected him in his time of need  You regret not helping him  assuming that helping him would have saved him  Those are really difficult feelings and the belief that your action   or lack of   is key here    well  that makes it even more painful  Your belief may not be accurate  though  Consider that before you toss aside your entire life and all it holds  He had been through a lot of loss and if he treated others the way he treated you  he likely reached out to multiple people and was met with silence  He made a lot of decisions that ultimately left him miserable  This isn't on you  If you take responsibility  that's on you  Instead of throwing away your entire life  you could choose to learn something and move forward  doing what you can  not including taking responsibility for what wasn't yours  to make the world a little bit better  The choice is yours  but I hope you'll consider what I said   Now  I feel sad that I can't relate to you when it comes to the drugs and breakups  I guess there's my lack of experience showing   but regarding M and her friend  I am very sorry for what has happened everything  When it comes to people like those  as generic as it sounds  you just have to keep your chin up no matter how hard you can or it may feel  I've been through a few hardships of my life that made me want to take it  and keeping my chin up  looking at that sliver of light at the end of the tunnel that ever so slowly got bigger the closer I got to it  made me feel all the better   Insomnia and depression are two very "hard to handle" things  and many people know that  and depression from what you've just told me seems pretty bad for you  You think the world's bleak and you want out of it  I get it  It sucks  it's hard and you don't want to be hurt anymore  But here's a simple little thing to help with the depression   Assuming you have the time and energy to  clean your room with the lights off  Then  when you're done  turn the lights on  any kind of light  a lamp or the room light   Try and look at everything you have and think about how happy it's made you to look at all of it  list the things you're happy with and try and look forward to that when you get home from school  It helps a ton                           Don't know if you are ready to hear this and you can delete this comment if you find it too explicit   Your parents sound like absolute assholes  Your life seems to be revolving around them and I understand they have a tight grip on you  It is absolutely devastating when someone takes their life but not for the one who does it  They leave behind the people who truly love them  like your fianc  as well as people who think they do the best for them  your parents   Your fianc sounds like a great person  You have to devote yourself completely to your SO and trust that you will make it together  Whatever it takes  Even if it means your parents are out of the picture  Tell yourself your fianc and yourself are together alone in this and other people who want to help are welcome to  People who only bring negativity and bring you down have to be eliminated from this equation  Only then will you see progress  Plan your wedding with your friends  Let your fianc help you  I'm sure there will be times in the future you will need to help him her  Accepting help from the person who cares about you the most is very important  It will make them feel good that they can help you    You have to make it clear to your parents that you will no longer take their shit  Make it known that if they don't want to see you happy  then they can forget about you  A manipulative way to make them feel guilty will often make them tender in the future  Maybe they will realize what they were doing really wasn't the best for you  Once you stand up to them  you will feel better and I can almost guarantee they will at least respect you and your future decisions  The world is tough and often times we are dealt shit hands  We have to make changes let go of what we seem to be fit in order to stay in the game  Life is wonderful  You have too much going for you  Be thankful for what you have  Cherish it  Build on it  Live your life your way  Not the way anyone else seems fit   Lol it is insane to follow  but the story mode really helps get you geared up for multiplayer  I suck horribly at shooters but I have a blast playing it  It keeps me grounded and focused on it instead of the thoughts in my head  Think about  Think about it all the time  Think about how everyone around you that genuinely cares will feel  Think about your funeral  People crying and wishing they knew how you felt  Think about the lives you could have impacted if you were alive  What you could have done to make your loved ones proud  Think about life going on after your passing  It's hard to believe anyone genuinely cares about you when you are so down but I can guarantee you have at least one person who doesn't want to see you anything but completely happy  Depression is hard  It truly is  That doesn't mean you have to give up  When you think about suicide think about anyone that has ever met you  You may not believe it but you have impacted their life  If it wasn't for you  they might have different opinions or views  Help you help yourself  Find things that bring you up  You have to be very brace to keep living  It takes courage to bring yourself together and become successful  Be courageous  Be someone that makes your loved ones proud   I have to ask  friend  why do you tie your self worth to other people  Even if everything you said was true  and I'm not saying it is   I don't know you   so what  One is not worthless simply because one spends a lot of time alone  one is not worthless simply because others do not see one's worth   It might be useful to try and start thinking from your own perspective  and not from everyone else's  Friend  I'm so sorry for everything that you're dealing with  It sounds like you already have so much on your plate  and all of this turmoil with the women in your life is just too much for you to handle  I can understand that   it would be a lot for anyone to handle   Is it possible for you to  just  be friends with Girl2  I know it isn't what you want  I know you have feelings for her that are more than friendly love and affection  but you still have her in your life   You say that you can't talk to anyone about it  but I hope you realize that this sub is an exception  We're here to talk as much as you need  I'm here to talk  Maybe the people in your life might not understand  but some people will  I don't know how long you've been having problems with your husband  but maybe consider marriage counseling  Feel free to pm  26F Thanks  and I dunno  I guess it might have been okay that way before we got together at new year  I suppose I sort of got my hopes up and it was the only thing keeping me up after the first break up  and I thought maybe it was something and now that we've taken that step it seems impossible for me to go back in a way  even though she doesn't want that  and it's tearing me apart but there's nothing I can do  It's one of the biggest factors of why I want to die  I don't feel like I have any control and my self confidence is non existent and it feels like this is just going to keep happening if I keep on going  I don't want to have to go through more pain of watching people I have feelings for get with other people whilst I've been sidelined  I always feel like I'm side lined and I don't really matter to people  and if I keep on it's just going to stay that way  and it's so painful and makes me feel so lost  I can't take it  I live for the day when I turn 18 so I can finally start my life Is covering it with a tattoo an option  I dont think any make up is really water proof  except maybe some mascara  I think sweat wise you should be ok  You can google it though im sure the kat von d stuff is pretty close   Not meaning to sound critical  but it's hard to say without trying to provide a more detailed reason for why you want scars  A lot of people don't cut  because  of the pain  but because there's another reason they want to inflict pain on themselves  like self loathing or so they can feel an intense emotion   Although  from what you said in your post  you're doing it for  your  viewing and not others  The attention of other people wasn't mentioned at all  so I'm thinking that's a mark for "possibly not " Is seeing someone an option  Ive found that going to see someone is really helpful in figuring out why you engage in self harm behaviors  what your triggers are and ways you can re train yourself to react to said triggers   Well  as much as one might crave total isolation  it's perhaps rare that one never wants any human connection at all  I suggest going with it  i wanna say your soul is now longing for it and wants to be alive among people you can connect to  even though for whatever reason it has been feeling what it has been feeling  But that feeling of wanting to end your life maybe isn't what your soul deep down really needs as much as the feeling of being free  connected  joyful    Of course when you are feeling quite the opposite  you see no reason why you should live and keep suffering  But maybe your soul wants to lead you beyond those feelings  to explore other opportunities that might break it free from the darkness of those feelings as well as the isolation it has been enduring    So it's maybe just time to try another approach is why you are feeling these new feelings     Maybe try some of the suggestions in my first response  or some other ideas  and see how it goes  Allow yourself to live  to connect  serve  enjoy  see and experience the world beyond your four walls and maybe you'll be giving your soul something it now feels is time or is overdue for its own nourishment    Maybe it wants you to be happy and perhaps is trying to lead you there where you haven't been but just might be the key to unlocking a different way to feeling about life    Might as well give it a chance  Good luck  Again  all just might be well in the end  if it's not well now  it's not yet the end  You are valuable always    Peace be with you and thanks again  Ahh sorry I accidentally touched the submit button on my phone     Can any mod please delete this post   Mostly  yes  Me being on this planet makes me feel like a burden to everyone  The clothes I have  the water I drink  the food I eat  it could have gone to someone with a future or purpose  Not sure if that made a lot of sense  though  Hope you change your mind  If not  may your end be quick and painless  Farewell my fellow dick joker    I am perfectly happy to talk about anything and everything with you  mate  I can't say that I've experienced it  but I've plenty of friends who have  or at least sexual assault  I understand why you'd wanna keep it all bottled up  society isn't exactly as kind to male victims of rape as female  But getting it out is a good thing  and I'd wager at least getting all of this off your chest has helped at least somewhat   I think the first thing that should be said is that just because you were raped doesn't make you worthless  It doesn't mean that you mean nothing  You're still a person  and you still mean just as much to those around you as you did before    I  do  think going to a professional over this would be a good idea  Like  really good  But talking about it more personally than clinically with a friend is bound to help too  so I'm happy to help with that  It differs from person to person  I still hate the pain  I cut solely for making marks on my body  so the pain is what deters me from cutting  But I know plenty of people that can cut and don't struggle with the pain   I  too  can really relate  particularly to this " I go into this with complete clarity and rationality "  I just wonder if we are correct  But I know I sure do hurt  for the better part of all day every day  I feel terribly for you  but I can assure you that you have a lot more enjoyable things in life to look forward to  as time goes on and you get older and further away from your parents  Life isn't easy  that is for sure  but it sounds like you have a lot to look forward to  Hang in there   For me  I cut very deep  There is a "sweet spot"  forgive the lack of another term  that doesn't hurt much  if at all  Once you get past the subcutaneous fat layer  it begins to hurt again  Muscle can be very painful  Surface cuts are also more painful   I have missed it every day for over a year and a half  save for one slip up  Hey friend  I'm sorry it's so rough for you right now  I hope it turns around for the better  but yeah  I know it sucks right now  So I hope you can hang in there and be able to see things turn around for the better  All might actually be well in the end  if it's not well now  it's not yet the end  So please do not despair  as much as you can help it     Have you considered talking to someone about how you feel  maybe someone with training who might be able to help you sort out your feelings and help you through the pain  like a therapist or counselor     I think it might make a difference if you haven't given it a chance  Maybe you have nothing to lose in doing so and might find a different  more hopeful  perpective  as impossible as that seems    You can try a free hotline like the one at http   yourlifeyourvoice org   which i personally found helpful for myself  The number is available 24 7 but they have text chat email available too  at certain times  It's a good site to look around too  for example  check out their "tips" section or their bulletin boards    If you're able to get yourself to a counselor  like a school counselor  or a therapist  that'd be great  otherwise a hotline works as a good first step for sure  There's a huge list of other resources here you might find helpful too   http   greatist com grow resources when you can not afford therapy  You are valuable  priceless  Please do no more harm to yourself or be unkind to yourself in anyway  friend    If you are ever in immediate danger of harming yourself again in anyway or think you might  do not hesitate to get help  get to a hospital or call 911 or any emergency number  And there is also the national suicide prevention lifeline  http   www suicidepreventionlifeline org has their number as well as a link to chat     The following site has more resources  as well as an information line you can call for more help when it comes to self harm cutting  http   selfinjury com    Good luck and God bless and hang in there  May all be well in the end  Again  if it's not well  it's not the end  Again  you are valuable  always  no matter what  And again  please do not be unkind to yourself      Thanks and Peace be with you     It's different for everyone  but I actually believe that not throwing them out is more helpful  If you know the option is there  but you choose not to take it  that's a lot less pressure than if you know you can't at all   Also  and this probably won't make any sense at all  try not to judge yourself for 'not cutting deep'  I've been there  it isn't a bad thing   I'm so sorry you went through that  We're here for you  you're not alone  Need to talk  How are you today  Thanks for your answers   If you ever need to talk I'm here  and so are a lot of others  I'm going through a lot of bad stuff too  so i might be able to understand as much as I can  Just know that people care and are ready to help if you ever want to reach out to people  it's always good to get stuff off your chest  and it's even easier here  so just do what you think is best for you in getting support  I really hope you decide against it  because if you're this low you can only go up  I don't know how long that's going to take you  a few months or years  but one day you will look back  maybe look at your children and be happy that you didn't kill yourself  Byeee I live kind of close to Chicago so live music is always around  I just do't go see any much because of my service dog  It can be too loud for her at times  It looked a lot like Overwatch   I couldn't follow that gameplay much either   Gameplay is just getting too quick for me nowadays  So I guess to feel less pain  you shouldnt cut so deep or you shouldnt cut the surface  If its between them is it less painful   Yeah  it's not a perfect test obviously  there are some flaws in it  but it's kind of neat to see the different traits and whatnot   No  you don't sound insensitive at all  Especially if you have the urges  that's something I think we can all relate to  If we didn't feel those urges  we wouldn't have started  I urge you to talk to someone before this gets out of control  That's how most of us started  I think  with small cuts that aren't too deep  Whatever is causing you to want to hurt yourself  is treatable   and you  can get help   especially if you ask for help  now   Please PM me if you need any support or even just a listening ear    All of that being said  to answer your question  I remember reading a while back that most people that SH do not report feeling much pain at all during the process of doing it  Your body produces endorphins when you cut  which temporarily makes you feel better mentally  They also serve as natural painkillers  because if your body didn't block that pain  you'd be screaming  Even self harm aside  typically when you get hurt seriously  it barely hurts at all because of this  It often hurts more to skin your knee than to deeply cut your arm because of those endorphins    So yes  for most people  after a certain point  you do get used to the pain in the moment  Between your natural pain tolerance increasing and the endorphins  it takes more and more to feel that pain again  And if you're someone that "enjoys" the pain  that's what pushes you to cut deeper and more frequently  That's what makes it so dangerous  you get used to it after a certain point so it takes more and more to get the effect you want  So to tie it back together  that's what makes cutting so dangerous even early on and that's why I urge you to get help  now  while it's still a minor problem  If you don't take care of yourself now  you may see it devolve into a much worse problem than you think it could be   Thanks  I'll try that later when I have time  I dont really feel like my depression is all that bad  there's a million people out there who have it way worse than I do  I just let it get to me sometimes and I have to vent like I did last night   People are shitty  but their luck runs out and eventually they get what they deserve Yep  I enjoy seeing the scars  I still do it for the "in the moment" experience of relief  but yeah    the scars are a nice bonus  I guess it feels good to see how shitty I feel sometimes inside on the outside    sort of a visual representation of something you can't see  It's been a while since I've done it because I haven't felt the need to  but yeah  I know exactly what you mean    There's a simple way to tell if it's "real" self harm  Are you hurting yourself intentionally  Then it's self harm  Don't worry about comparing your reasons to others  Your reasons aren't any less justified than anyone else's  Adding that guilt to it will just make you feel worse   I'm sorry that you have to feel this way  It's not fair  and you're not any less of a person because of it  If anything  this proves that you're  strong   You know you have this problem and while you're not proud of it  you're still roughing it out and surviving  That's difficult  I think that if most people had to experience what you do  they would not be able to handle it the way you do  Take pride in your perseverance  because it's something special that not many people have  If you ever need anyone to talk to  I'm here for you  Good luck  and stay safe    I think I get what you're saying  Things have changed between you and Girl2  and that change is making it all worse for you  Have you talked with Girl2 about all of this  though  I don't just mean your feelings for her  but also talking about how important she's been to you  It's possible that she can still be the support that you need  friend   I think you're right  to a certain degree  Pain doesn't end   at least  not permanently  We humans  we're messy creatures  and we make things hard on ourselves  and on each other  and we hurt one another  But there are things that counter pain  aren't there  You say that you feel that you don't really matter to other people  but is that true  It sounds like you have good friends  in Girl1 and Girl2  for instance  Aren't there other people who bring you joy and comfort  aren't there other things that you enjoy  It doesn't help your romantic troubles   I'll be the first to admit that  But  it's something else entirely  and I personally think it can be just as important  if not more  You are welcome    I won't pretent to know what you are going through  When you say nobody understands  you may be accurate to a point as your average person would not comprehend your loss  However  no matter what you believe  you can live on and find happiness  Do something amazing with your life in the memory of your fiance  Don't worry about whether people understand or not    they don't need to  This is your life  yes it has been impacted  but things change with time  Your fiance could very well want you to succeed   A dedication to that sucess might make her or her family proud  And it will make her memory live on  A few things here  and please don't mistake this for being critical  as I'm simply speaking from personal experience and I  know  you're doing this out of the kindness of your heart  I really respect that and you sound like a great person for it    First off  please don't try to diagnose them  We can't know why other people self harm or want to self harm because we can't experience what they do  The only way we can know what they're going through is if they tell us  and that's not always easy for them    So  that being said  here's what  you  need to do to help your friend  Simply  be there   Tell her that you care about her and you want her to know that you want to help however you can  Don't pressure her  don't ask too many questions  just tell her that if she needs to talk that you'd love to listen  Don't try to offer advice  just make sure she feels your care and make sure she feels safe enough to be able to talk with you    I know you just want to help  That's amazing that you do  it shows that you're a good person  I wish that a friend could make everything better immediately  trust me  it would've saved  me  a lot of trouble   but they can't  Just be there  I promise you can help more than you think just by offering support   Do you want to talk  I am here  listening and willing  this really means alot to me  I feel more weak for feeling this way  the fact that other people can let themselves be okay  and i feel like my mind and heart are operating on their own  I have barely enough control to call it that  Huh  Small world  Friend of mine is from Chicago    What's your dogs name  I've two  Spaniel Jack Russell cross  We were gonna call them Walter and Jesse  but my sister vetoed Walter  so they're Sam and Jess now   Her name is Kala   She goes everywhere with me   She's an Anatolian Shepherd   What region are you from  Awesome   Can I ask what she does for you  Service dogs have always fascinated me    I'm from Ireland   You're not weak  You have a son  and with how much emotion you feel  that indicates a lot of empathy which makes me think that you're probably a great parent  Life isn't easy for anyone  but it's so much harder when you have to struggle with the types of things that we do  And I honestly do believe that the resilience it takes to get through  every day  when you feel the way you do is amazing  You're stronger than you think  I promise you  Don't underestimate the power of talking to people  either  That offer stands very strongly  if you need to talk  please let me know  You've got this  I know you do   I haven't yet  and I doubt I will  I feel like I'll scare her off or just make things worse  I don't think she's interested in me very much anyway so I feel like if I come on too hard she'll leave anyway  I don't know  I don't think she'd get it  she probably wouldn't understand and it wouldn't change anything I guess    I suppose  I do have friends and stuff but whenever I'm around them I feel like it's fake if you see what I mean  It feels like I'm not really enjoying myself and they'd prefer it if I weren't there in a way  because I feel like I put a downer on then  Nothing seems as important anymore  And thanks again for the support  it means a lot   Thank you for the response     Well I am not on the edge  Its just an idea for me since I am afraid to do it and everyone asks about scars  And yeah it makes sense that way  So I just have to close my eyes and cut I guess lol   Hey  Please message me  I think I might be in need of talking to someone via voice  I tnink i want to try to get things out  I dont know  Sure thing  You're absolutely right  I think  The one time I had my razors taken from me I had a complete panic attack when I went to look for them and couldn't find them  I wasn't even planning on cutting at the time  I just wanted to know it was there  By the time the panic set in  I  did  want to cut  It was one of the worst times of my life  honestly  Yeah  I think keeping them there is the way to go  I haven't cut in about a month but I know the option's there    may not be healthy for me  but it keeps me from freaking out   20 M  If you need someone to talk to  I'm here for you  I'm open to a PM or just talking in here  whatever works best for you  Stay safe    I don't have those apps but I've been raped  and I'm dating  for years  a male who was raped too  You're welcome to message me if you'd like  If you need someone to talk to  let me know  I'd be more than happy to talk with you  I'm about a month clean myself  I know what it's like to struggle with those urges  Stay strong because you  can  get through this    She helps to sense when anxiety attacks are on coming   I have PTSD Have you ever had sex  Why do you feel like you're asexual    I had a boyfriend for almost 4 years  he ended up leaving me for someone else  Not because of the no sex part  We never even had sex  Whenever we would mess around  I would get this urge to cry  I just didn't want it  I ended up having sex with someone after he left me  and I didn't enjoy it    I'm scared I may be asexual  I'm just hoping I haven't had it with the right person yet    Are you suicidal because you feel you're asexual  I took 15 benedryl once and fell asleep  woke up in the middle of the night and prayed that I wouldn't die  My head and hands were so heavy      I told myself I would never do something that stupid again  It seems to me that you might be suffering from depression  Have you seen a doctor about these feelings  I'm willing to talk about whatever you need  It's very helpful and it feels very good to get things off of your chest  When you bottle it up like you did  it eats you away from the inside  Talk to someone about this  You shouldn't be feeling this way  Please reach out  You aren't alone  Don't let it escalate  You will be okay  many people have experienced what you're going through  and it is treatable  Talk to your family  Talk to your doctor  Do not let them talk you into "it's just a phase" bs  Every day you spend feeling like this is a day wasted  Allow yourself to be happy  Get help   No but I plan  My parents are makeing jokes about my state and saying things like "you only makeing excuses to don't study" so talking about this with them is hard as fuck  I am so sorry  No part of what happened was your fault  And I do not believe that anything you could have done would have changed it  I know what it is like to have something happen that you cannot talk about  to have your friends and family expect you to be normal   I used to have WhatsApp and am redownloading it right now  PM me   I would love to talk to you  I find it amazing that the dog can realise before the human  She sounds like a fantastic part of your life   Loneliness is terrible  I've experienced it too  and it can be so suffocating  No one should be lonely  Would you like to talk  I would love to get to know you  I talked with one of my friends about this and surprisingly she stop talking to me and left me behind  Parents say that I only makeing excuses to don't study  Christ I feel like I'm going to kill myself in less than half of a year if I didn't got help    Don't understand why that guy would try to actually incite suicide   I'm managing   Hah  honestly those thoughts go around too  A lot of hatred driving me right now  The main argument I have against it is that death is too easy for her  I want her to live with the consequences of her actions and get her come uppance in other ways Hello cakerton  I had a couple friends tell me that too  It's just hard to  I have a habit of putting the people I really care about above me even if it costs me my happiness  It's hard for me to rationalize that I deserve to be happy  I'm just tired of being constantly disappointed and depressed  One moment I think everything's going great  then the next  boom  Everything goes to shit  And yet  I still put those people above me  It's hard for me to see the point of my future    I ended up finding a jacket online  that I was looking for forever and got it  I also ended up cleaning a bit as well  I really appreciate those kind words  They mean a lot to me  I hope you have a good day   Hi  yeah  I'm ok   Been living with the daughter and her little kids   She is the daughter of the woman from church   I'm ok  less suicidal  a bit calmer but still waiting to be kicked out of here and being on the street   How are you doing  Did you have a nice new years  That's honestly not the memory I want my kids to have of me  I don't want them to remember me as somebody too weak to keep fighting either but I guess sometimes we just gotta be selfish and forget about dying a hero right  I dunno  It's a horrible situation I've found myself in out of nowhere  I don't fight and I'm generally doing whatever I can to help my family   Doubly hurts that they all were so quick to throw me to the dirt as soon as someone made up a story to get out of trouble at fucking school While this would certainly be a way to ask for help  have you considered asking in a more calm and collected way  I've done that for over 2 years  It hasn't worked  I've lost all patience for these people I feel this way all the time awwwwwwwww he looks adorablse  yes ik that is not a word but still  2017  hmmm    hopefully get back to competing in wreslting tournaments  and like generally surviving the year  maybe even catching myself one of those super rare things called a girlfriend  but you know  legends are hard to catch      but otherwise  wish you a great year too  D I won't be found guilty  I know this is the one crime that can be convicted without a lick of evidence but I can prove some of the lies are lies  the police report mentioned some Facebook messages I can prove never existed  but the thing is  this is something that has already been spread far and wide  For the rest of my life I will have a reputation of a child molester  My family have all burned their bridges with me  I'm literally reduced to a shell of what I was just a month ago   Someone so completely innocent should never have to live through this hell  One lie is enough to ruin a life these days  It's guilty until proven innocent in this day and age and even when the proof is there people will still think of you in a certain way  This world is so fucking corrupt  what part of math are you having trouble with  That's very true  I never thought of it that way  It does make sense  I'll try not too  Thank you  We have been to counselling but he doesn't want to go anymore because he feels the counsellor only blames him Hey I'm experiencing the same thing pretty much    Just hit me up if you wanna talk about anything  I know how it feels to be lonely and feeling like theres no one seeing you  I was in a similar situation to you when I was applying to university  My situation was different  but I had a very difficult home life and family situation  and was suicidal    Get yourself to university  Things will get better  You'll be able to have a fresh start  and think with a clear mind that is not affected by your parents  Your family life will no longer define you  and you will be able to make new friends and have new experiences   I suggested not to approach by the way of telling everyone else to die and that OP would then go jump in front of a train  Approaching it from a more calm and rational way  explaining their thoughts feelings and then how they want help    When someone is in the hospital and suicidal  they evaluate for a patient's capacity to make their own decisions  Being deemed incompetent to make treatment decisions can end badly  There's a very different experience when one voluntarily admits themselves versus when one is involuntarily committed    So having a 'fuck everyone' attitude and being aggressive is not something I advise    I don't suggest lying  I suggest that there are alternative ways to approach this with a psychiatrist   It's ultimately up to you  but it may help to keep in mind the consequences of what you say and how you say it   Whew    I am glad you are ok  and that you were able to get yourself a bit of productivity   u cakerton has some good words  and as humans we may not have a constant happiness  but we all deserve moments of peace and satisfaction   You do seem like person who cares about others  and that is a wonderful and rare quality   Don't be tired of you  please   That is part of you   We are always around if you want to vent  You can message me  if you want  What consequences  I literally want to kill myself  I have nothing to lose Treatment wise  as I referred to in my other comment  and how professionals evaluate your state of mind   being deemed incompetent and such   So if I give them a totally unambiguous "I am not mentally stable"  surely that's a good  thing  I get that  currently in a depressing episode aswell  family dosent acknowlede that at all and gibes me shit for failing my exams for it  its a tough spot  but seeking help will help you and will make it better  hang in there OP    I feel you  don't despair because you're not alone  Im here if you want to talk They're a type of white blood cell  The most common type  Small  fearless  weak in a lot of ways  and they seem quite incapable of doing much at a first look  but turn out to have a few tricks   They're first on the scene when there's a wound or infection  When you have pus  it's mostly them  being dead  They don't last long  they can't even really maintain their own proteins properly  But they eat bacteria like crazy  gobble it right up  Also they're ridiculously cheap  thanks to being disposable  your body pumps them out like crazy when you get sick  And they have this neat trick where they use their own DNA to link between each other to form a sticky trap to ensnare viruses    Well  it's neat unless you have Cystic Fibrosis  Because the lack of chloride ion transfer across the cell membrane does something to the inherent immune defense of the lung membranes  causing various chronic low level infections that have neutrophils flock like crazy to fix  The neutrophils do their web thing  which causes a super sticky mucus to develop  Which  used to  suffocate people to death  in the way the immune system sometimes does    Also  I don't work in the medical field or have a degree there  I just love this stuff  I have gone to several seminars  and done some work with cells and cell cultures  enough to know how ridiculously important an immune system is at least  I only learnt about the Cystic Fibrosis thing after reading about a treatment for it  and there's family history for it so it was the first genetic disease I ever knew about   Turns out  because the mucus is mostly bound together by your own cells' DNA  the way to loosen it up is to use an enzyme that breaks apart DNA   I would never have thought of it  I'd be all like  "Use amylase  Not working  More amylase " or something stupid like that  Hey   Sorry so late in responding   I do try  but sometimes I just can't be on all the time   It sounds like you got a lot to say  and it all got blurted out in just a few lines      We are here to listen and support  Relationships can be such a hard challenge  and it always feels horrible to feel betrayed or marginalized  but killing yourself too extreme a response     Perhaps I assume to much    is there more beyond the challenges of love  Repay the kindness and spread it to others  Hey Lionhrt  Sorry I am on this so late   As much as I try to keep up  I can't  and I would like to ensure that everyone one who reaches for help on SW gets a note   I can't always do it  but I try     But really this is all about you    Are you clinically depressed or anxious in a way that you want to injure yourself or others   You ask a really interesting question    but it is a more philosophical religious spiritual question of the purpose of life     Did I get that right  Is there more lurking behind your question  I took 15 20 of my medication  Quetiapin  and I woke up Idk How long after  and i couldn't move  and got sick everytime i tried  Then i finally got up after some hours  But I couldn't walk and I crawled to the bathroom and fell asleep  woke up again Idk How long after and went back to my room and fell asleep  I still wish it would've worked  Second time is the lucky time  I guess Hey are you there   You seem like you have a lot going on  and maybe you want to vent or chat  I moved out early in 2016  after spending far too long living with my parents  The best part was cooking whatever I felt like cooking and feeding it to my housemates and having them enjoy it   Oh  also  kitties  My housemates have cats and they are adorable and just a little bit derpy but very affectionate  Let's talk  shan't we  What's on your mind right now  How old are you  What do you think about your dad right now  and do you want to distance yourself away from him or try to help him  Hit me up  Sorry im a bit late  29 mtf feel free to message me  Also  I could care less about my appearance at the moment in all honesty  My hands have a skin problem  so decorated arms would probably complement them better  People I know also do not take these things seriously until it gets to a certain severity due to people trying it out for example  I'm doing great  You caught me at the right time  Got anything to vent   I want to stab me and make me hurt   Sounds painful  I don't think your brain wants this   Is therea reason why are you sad depressed    Talk to your family  friends about your problems  Visit a doctor  Go outside  try to look for new friends    How old are you   When you go outside with your friends  doesn't mean you need to drink  Go and play some billiard  darts     Try to look for a new hobby   Talk with your parents about your problems  visit a doctor  You need some therapy  Or proud and happy If it doesn't go your way  I'll be ready whenever to talk  Yeah you build up a tolerance and don't worry  this isn't insensitive at all  Ohhh maybe One Day we will meet  me as a singer and you as a spectator  And we will never know because reddit is so anonymous  But if you're there  keep your eyes open for a blonde lyric mezzo  Even if you are an attention seeker  I don't know if you are or aren't tbh   there's an underlying reason for that  You need to figure out why you seek attention if you feel you do that  and then figure out how to move past that reason  It's not your fault  Those are horrible guys   just fucking idiots  I know it's not easy but I would recommend to you to go to the police  It may be hard to do  but it's the right thing and they get their shit off  Talk with your mother about your problems  Do the same  with her  Ask her if she's ok  Does she have a boyfriend       I wanted to talk to her but then I saw her putting something back into her bag  some strange whiteish stuff in a bag  I immediately thought of Cocaine since that's most likely what it is   You're 15  you go to school  Look for new friends  Visit you're school counselor    Go with your mother to a therapy session  You both need it  Yeah  I think it might even have to do with self expression  like you want to make your mark on your body or something  I also want to get tattoos  like a lot of them  and I think this ties into my desire to be different and expressive  So true  If I cut it used to be sometimes just bc of the attention   sometimes of the nurses   Bow it isn't always but the main reason was that I was too scared to have friends  social anxiety  and a chappy place to live and no idea Wath to do with life or school  I wasn't ashamed bc I knew this was temporarily   few te5ars  How is it not my fault they say it is because I dress slutty and they couldn't have raped me because Im gross and ugly You posted this on the depression subreddit already and what the guys on there says is true  You were raped  You're not gross and you're not a slut  You should talk to your family and the police I have been in a similar state of mind myself where looking at myself I could tell myself that I was living a good life  I had friends and a beautiful gf  I had a job and was working towards a future  Fresh out of high school  Stubbornly I didn't talk to anyone about how I felt  What ended up happening as a result was that I had an identity crisis at 19  I'm 21 now and it didn't get easier in that time but I feel as if I had let people know what was going things would be different   I'm going through some more stuff however that only being happy when around friends and feeling like you are dependent on them for your own happiness  your not alone  I ended up moving in with my closest friend and his partner  it keeps me going  What I am saying is try to understand what keeps you going and what makes you happy but don't tell yourself who you are  go in for the ride  Trying to keep things the way they are in fear of those feelings getting worse is how they get worse  I may not be able to help you or give you advice but I am more than to talk to you whenever you need it  Be it here or in private messages  Whatever makes you comfortable Kinda  you see that good feeling you get is endorphins being released from the cutting  it's a chemical that is very similar to opiate painkillers as endorphins are what the body uses to help combat pain  So since endorphins are similar in functionality to opiates you can bet that addiction to those endorphins is going to act very similar as well  namely needing more of them to get the same good feeling as before  This means that you'll have to cut deeper to release more endorphins as your body builds up a tolerance to them  now at the same time you are building up your pain tolerance as well  repeatedly going through the same pain on a regular basis will cause you to become used to it and able to sometimes not even feel the pain at all after enough exposure  So while yes you are building up pain tolerance  you're also building an addiction and tolerance to endorphins  so while the cuts you make are shallow right now  they'll get deeper and the pain will become lesser  but watch out  I won't tell you to stop or that cutting is bad  never thought it right to  but it is an addiction and you can find yourself cutting so deep that you need stitches or you're hitting arteries  be careful  you can end up dead real quick if you aren't  my advice for this  and you may not need it anytime soon but still  is to make more cuts that are more shallow to release more endorphins than making fewer cuts that are deeper  it's more dangerous to make three cuts that are a half inch deep than it is to make ten cuts that are a centimeter deep   I know i just want different options because i think its my fault they said Im to ugly and fat to be raped Well first  thanks for providing me with some background    You got a lot going on  and I think being a screenwriter can be cool    First from a practical standpoint    there is no romantic relationship that is worth dying over   None   That is bullshit that has been served up ever since Shakespeare killed off Romeo and Juliet   Ohhhhh great love story    No  it was a tragedy and cautionary tale   Having said that  many of us on here  myself included  have been plagued with the pain of losing a loved one   It hurts like a muthafucka   No denying that   It can be like a death    and like a death    it is best to move on  and do all that you can to put time and space between you and loss   That's the practical advice that is so hard to accept    it is like looking at a desert and saying that there is an end on the other side   Factually  there is  but I get that it doesn't feel possible to get over such pain   Like all wounds  the process of healing is one of scabbing and itching  until one day you realize that you are already healed     Right now  the best you can do is learn from the experience you have   I do caution you on something    It isn't so much that you cannot ever share your feelings  but perhaps you have to assess HOW you share   There is a time and place and there is technique involved   Wooing a woman  can be a bit like the parable of boiling a frog    TL DR    How does one boil a frog   Not the seemingly efficient way of tossing a frog into boiling water as the frog will jump out    Instead  you put the frog in lukewarm water  set it on the stove  and the frog  being cold blooded  will stay in the pot    You turn up the heat slowly  degree by degree  to let the frog get used to higher temperatures    eventually the frog is boiled    I did not make up this story    google for more   Point is  if you chase a prospective loved one too fast    they will run    wouldn't you   The act of loving is about accepting patience    yes  there is the risk of friendzoning   but for a love  you want a best friend     If you just want sex    then that is different    go to the redpill sub for more on that   Perhaps before you regard yourself as fucked over by life  you can assess    really be honest with yourself    if you can learn and try different approaches to a problem    I am sure that you tried everything you know  but have you tried things other people know  that you don't   All I'm saying is that you cant abandon life due to some failures     In fact  the best  most enduring  way to become an expert is to commit thousands of hours to work through the tediousness of becoming an expert      I am 22 I do feel like distancing myself from him but I still live at home with my parents and brother and I can't drive and don't have my driver's licence So far I am just glad you reached out to us  OP maybe tell us a little but about your situation  so we can work at this together     Study  just try to study    Here  try to learn from  Khan Academy  https   www khanacademy org    You're 15  Focus on school  You're still young  you don't need a gf at this age  I still have friends who are 22 24 years old  virgins  and they never had a gf  And guess what  they're happy    School is more important  Trust me  you need it    Talk with your mother  try to look for a math tutor  You're not selfish for not caring about upsetting people  It's your appearance  you can hide your cuts if you want to  or not  And if people feel offended then that's their problem  Not to say that it's the same at all  but it's likely the same people who will be offended   but if I was to make out with a guy in public  there'd be no reason to hide  and most people would not care  and would just go about doing whatever  And those who were offended  they're the sort of people I'd kinda want to offend   Wanting to be left alone when feeling bad  that's what I get most  Because you might not ever be "cured"  but you can establish a sort of equilibrium inside yourself  where things are calm and you simply never need to cut  But this is a place of no outside thoughts  No words of any doctors or parents or redditors  Sorry  I'm getting a little abstract here  What I mean to say is that the opinions and words of other people should never be allowed to affect who you really are  for better or for worse  And if you decide to stop self harm  it should be because  you  decide to stop  not because anyone else decides for you  Maybe he doesn't want to believe  I think parents have excellent skills at making reality up as they go along  Keep pushing  you need and deserve this  That's not how it works  They didn't have your permission  they raped you  These are not the kind of guys who's opinions you should listen to I don't know  I've been feeling better on Christmas break  but whenever I go back to school I always feel like isolating myself from everyone  I feel alone  and like I don't have any value  I can't date or make friends with anyone because I have no self worth and can't connect with others  I always get suicidal thoughts over the most minor things  and it sucks  Thank you for asking You have to realize that you're only 18 and have so much of your life ahead of you  College or whatever else you might have planned is going to be starting sooner than you think  Who knows what's going to happen a few years from now with the two of you  Just try to stay positive about it and she will most likely come back to you when things stop working with this new guy  At that point it's up to you to decide what you want to do   It's hard trying to stay positive barley have friends  and we have class together  That's the price you have to pay to save time hello I'm lonely too  It's devastating  Would you like to talk  PM me   That's nice  Just tell her to be free  Tell her that you won't mind if she will start to look for a new man in her life     You said something about cocaine  I hope you're wrong  How about your grandparents  Does she have a sister brother   When it's the last time when she spoke with them    By the way  I don't know how much this sub reddit can help you  but  if you look for help advice  Quora is a good place to start  Maybe they can help you more than us    I know you lost a good friend  Do you think you can find another one  too   I don't say that you need to replace your friend with another  I want to say that  maybe  you need someone to replace that hole from your soul   But not now  of course  maybe when you're ready    You're still young  you don't need to die  Think about your mother  She will be ruined  Spend some time with your mother  Watch a movie togheter  play some video games  cook togheter  Go outside togheter  You both need that   And with that "drug" problem  I don't think I can help  I don't want to say something stupid  Just check that community  I'm sure they will help you   And yes  a family therapy for both of you  togheter  Do you think you can afford that   Why do you want to know  Does it make someone's harm any less valid or deserving of attention  I don't do it for the pain  I do it for the comfort of having marks on my body  So I'm with you on this feeling  I'm confused  what do you mean   I has gotten less painful for me  Okay  Do you feel as if it would be worth it  That's a stupid argument they make  1  Don't listen to them  they are fucking stupid  2  Again  please go to the police and they will get what they deserve  3  Of course they say bad things to you because they know you feel bad  Why such people would do it anyway is something I still don't get  So  again it is NOT your fault  Don't listen to anyone saying otherwise    I honestly had to check I wasn't seeing two posts from the same person on the front page  This is kind of a common feeling and it is easy to feel the doubt about what your self harm means  Really it is a personal connection you feel to something that gives you comfort  For some people that comfort is in pain  in treating themselves  in seeing their body respond to damage  in seeing marks on their body  Whatever you feel is unique to you and understanding the reason why you self harm can make it easier to think whether it is something you can keep doing  Or whether there are alternatives  I know it might not feel like this was the best outcome for you  but I am glad that you are still with us  It's shitty that things have brought you to this point  If you want to tell us more about your reasons for wanting to die  this forum can be a helpful place to vent  Hope you are safe  Just because you're a girl doesn't mean you have to be feminine  I mean 'butch lesbian' is a whole thing and that's okay   Hey OP  It really sounds like you're not getting the support you need at the moment  It can be really shit when you know how bad things have got but people are just not understanding you  Is there anything specific which has made you want to end your life  or is it just a built up of feeling awful and not getting any help to change that  Why would they do something so horrible Don't do that  Go talk to the girl instead It sounds really stupid  but don't try to focus on self harm being a grand picture  Act as if it is meaningless and not a part of your daily routine  Give thanks for the days you are clean  but don't berate the days you relapse  see them as opportunities to move forward  Don't let it define you  and be glad for the times you are free from it  This subreddit is made up of a bunch of people who have been where you are now  and I don't think any of them with good conscience could tell you that you should be ashamed for how you are feeling  That's just adding badness on top of badness  I think we'd be more interested in hearing what has brought you to this point  than making you feel bad about how you're feeling  if you'd like to share we are listening  What's the girl like  Do you two get along  I know  I already posted a few times here  I just don't know anymore  I'm seeing a therapist about it but I don't think it helps  And the funny thing is I don't have a real reason to kill myself  I just ask myself everyday  "Why am I still here "  But I don't get an answer  buildup  every since i was a kid  i've had surgeries to repair a leg  infections  abuse  drugs  booze  the lot  i changed location  i changed friends  i basically left my family behind for a fresh start but everythings happening again  same cycle of emotional manipulation into destructive tendencies over and over and i'm sick of it  i just can't continue with it Okay  I understand    I just ask myself everyday  "Why am I still here "  But I don't get an answer   I usually try to avoid the "me too" answer  but if it helps  I have been in a similar place  I don't know if I have a definitive answer now  like some burning reason for my own existence  other than I was the fastest swimmer some 30 odd years ago  But I've found under that not having a reason to live thing  was a lot of sadness and feelings of isolation    I guess it's kind of like when you have one of the jigsaw puzzles where the box has a picture on the front of it of what the puzzle is supposed to look like when you're done putting it together  Life doesn't have a picture on the front of the box  you have to decide what the picture is  Which can be either exciting as hell or terrifyingly vague  depending on what's happening in your life    Do you have any good things  things you care about  things you love  things you are still curious about  There might be something here for you still  Hey   Do you feel like even if you make a bunch of changes again  you'll still end up back where you are  You sound like you feel hopeless and trapped  That's terrible  No  they should not be able to refuse you a transfusion  especially if it's that serious  Go to multiple hospitals if you have to  just please  get it done   No  I think relationships are fine and better with me as a woman   It's just that part of me feels that I would be more comfortable in my own skin if I had been born male  I don't know if I do it for attention  but that's not the only reason  so I wana have description of person who do this for attention  When you count someone as attention seeker  what he do etc  Very true  I don't like seeing "just doing it for attention" considered a less legitimate reason for SH  I don't SH anymore but mine was absolutely for attention  I was in a lot of emotional distress and I my boyfriend thought my constant anxiety and crying were just me being a brat and didn't take my emotional pain seriously  I cut so that he could physically see how mentally fucked up I was and it did make him take me more seriously  I don't feel bad about that    I don't think there's any point in arguing about whose mental disorder is more valiant than the other's   I don't know if I do it for attention  but that's not the only reason  so I wana have description of person who do this for attention  When you count someone as attention seeker  what he do etc  exactly that I mean there's no way of measuring how valiant someone's mental disorder is compared to others so you can't really have a legitimate argument about it anyway  Then it's not at all suprising that you feel like dying might be the best way out of that situation  If you feel like nothing is ever going to change  and it's just shit on top of shit  then I think that's a pretty natural conclusion to come to  I don't think it's the only option  but I don't think you should feel ashamed or bad about having those feelings  It makes me very angry for you that MH services are not listening to you when you are at this point  You deserve a hell of a lot better than someone just palming you off with something which doesn't feel a good fit for you  If they were to offer something different  do you think that would help  or are you past caring  I've had some shoddy interactions with MH services  and I know how invalidating and soul destroying it is to go to someone for help and find them not listening   I tried to get into overwatch  but I couldn't get into it  Titanfall    is pretty quick  have to have fast reflexes i just feel like if i do this  i'll either get help or i'll die so it won't be necessary but im scared Ive told her and she's said she understands but she wouldn't be angry  that she won't ever leave me etc but i just want her to hate me so she doesn't suffer  Having no friends is still better than having fake friends  because that way you would think you have friends  so you are in the right track  D   Now you just need to stop thinking too much about consequences and start talking to people   If the stupidest joke ever comes to your mind that is involving random stranger  you should tell it to him  I remember myself feeling like you  and now I became so communicative  I met a lot of people starting most random conversations whenever I thought about something  Sometimes only "nice jacket" can be enough   Also keep in mind that it can get very awkward if person is not very open  but in that case you can get them into conversation by asking them about their opinions  it's not the end of the world  So I just recommend you  next time you are in the bus  start the conversation with the person next to you without thinking that it may get awkward  cause it probably will  and that's the beauty of it     I really do  we haven't known each other long but it was an instant connection and i could talk to her endlessly I would say someone who goes out of their way to expose their cuts to others  Someone who cuts to manipulate or elicit a reaction from other people   Just liking the appearance of scars cuts  or not feeling bad about them  wouldn't make it for attention in my opinion  I feel like it would be pretty hard to cut for attention without realising it   the fact that you're considering it at all means you probably don't  You know she'll suffer less if you stay with her She's so understanding  so caring for somebody she doesn't know that well  she's so fragile too  so innocent and sweet despite everything thats happened  We get along like a house on fire  its like she's my soulmate but i just  cant be here anymore  i can't i can't i can't She'll suffer more by being with somebody like me  The things I've said and done to people  I cannot stand myself  She deserves the good  not the bad  Well that is one option  There's another more likely option that you won't die and you'll just get a bit sick  Paracetamol isn't a nice way to go   that whole "falling asleep and not waking up" thing is a myth  and actually it takes a couple of days for anything to happen  which is basically your liver shutting down  More likely you'll just damage your liver and up really unwell and under physical care of a hospital for a while  You might get the mental health help off the back of that but then if you got the help you needed you'd still spend a life with liver damage  so your new shiny world would be full of regret  You could get a similar effect from presenting at A E and telling them you are serious about killing yourself  only minus the OD and minus the liver damage    Another option would be to tell the services formally that you feel their standard of care has been lacking  and if necessary contact governing bodies  I don't know where you live  but if you live in the UK  this is pretty easy to cause a stink with a letter   Another option would be to look into charities or private therapists offering a sliding scale fee arrangement  where fees are reduced and go it alone    I know some of these might feel a monumental effort  and there might be other constraints like time and money which prevent you from doing them  but I just wanted you to know I think you deserve thinking about other options  if you are desperate   If you do this she'll get the bad  If you don't think you're good for her it would be better to let her down gently and just walk away That's my point exactly  It's like telling people with depression they've got no reason to be depressed because they have XYZ privileges    maybe someone with training  yes  a couple years ago  he blamed me alone for how i feel Huh    for perspective  I am spiritual in the sense that I believe in an natural force that is beyond that of humans   Whether we use language to describe this force as a god or gods or the God  I leave that to individuals to make that determination   Many have a hard time understanding that I believe in both science and in a supernatural spirit for reasons too much for the scope of this thread   I also participate in a religion for entirely secular reasons so that I may observe my beliefs with those who share my perspective   TL DR  Spirituality is what is beyond the understanding of the secular world   To answer your question    I believe that life plays out at a large systematic scale that is global if not universal   Life is statistically fair across a global demographic   There is a birth rate and a mortality rate    the birth rate is higher than the mortality rate across the globe  but it is no so in specific smaller subsets   Everyone born will die   If I were to translate that into religious wording  I would say that it is a merciless god that makes things blind to a supernatural intervention on an individual level    In other words  I do not believe in a god that will necessarily intercede at a sports event    or to reverse death   People will die of all the different ways that people could die   Science may reduce mortality and delay  but science cannot stop     Here's another way of approaching your question    Life is an attribute subject to a variety of interwoven complex conditions   Evil and Good are words used by humans that express a judgment or value system   Those words are independent of what life is or isn't   What one calls arbitrarily "good " like eating flesh  can be considered "evil" by another   What one calls "right" like capital punishment  can be "wrong" by another   Life on a planetary scale includes the living and the dying     To your point  dating can be relatively less significant compared to the the meaning of life     One last thing  before I go take care of some practical matters in my own life   People have a habit of convincing themselves of things that are said casually   In screenwriting you want drama so that people can see bigger than life    in real life  it does not help to dramatize feelings   Feelings feel authentic  but feelings do not necessarily convey universal truth   An example of this is when people will use the word "hate" to mean dislike or disapprove   Dislike could be accurate    whereas hate can add an element of hurt that is unnecessary     There is value in understanding and controlling one's feelings through the use of accurately descriptive language    That's what I'm trying to do  she's too good to hurt  Have you ever had sex    no   Why do you feel like you're asexual    because everything about it grosses me out  i jerk off every now and then  but i never do it with porn that involves sex   hj  bj   fine  but sex is just gross   Are you suicidal because you feel you're asexual   because of the lonelyness and knowledge that i never have someone to share my live with Hello OP  I'm sorry you are in such a bad place  I don't think you should be so tough on yourself about a drunken mistake at a party though  Yep  it'll be embarrassing  and yes you might even lose some friends over it  Actually that's probably the worst case scenario  more likely if they are your real friends they will say "hey  we are all human and make silly mistakes when we are drunk"  It's horrible when you wake up and remember something you did which was embarrassing  because it can feel like you are completely alone and a total failure  but you're not the first person to make a mistake when drunk  and you won't be the last  Do you think it would help to try and talk to the friends who were at the party   apologise  try and make amends  and then see how you feel  before doing anything permanent  Don't let a drunken mistake push your over the edge  Aye  I'm aware that the death would be a bit more of a painful  agonizing couple of days rather than a quick job  I'd done my research and figured it was the simplest way to at least do the job   I've attempted to turn up to A E and tell them before but its the same story   they refer me onto mental health  mental health then refer me to mindfulness techniques  I've been to A E 4 times in a year and i worry if i turn up again i'll just get the same response for a 5th time   I live in the UK but i worry about the short term while a letter goes through  The last letters I had with them were early December  when I ignored them once they offered me mindfulness sessions on a day when I couldn't actually turn up despite telling them so  Even if I do look into therapists etc I'll still be left to deal with the short term which I'm fucking terrified of   I want to do something else but I can't see that any other option is viable given my current state  just feel like i'm fucked if I do and fucked if I don't Killing yourself isn't the same as walking away  I probably do this for manipulation  I told about my scars to one person and every time I think she wanted to left me behind I cut myself  When I begin self harm I told her about it when I done it  After I realized that it makes thing only worse I stoped telling her about it but I haven't stop cuting becouse of it  I hide scars from others  when someone see them and ask how did I get them I respond things like "ii    ii    ii  don't know   realy" even telling her first time was hard   I don't blame you for being terrified  Right now you're trying to cope with all of this on your own  That's a lot to cope with  and this is a huge decision  I think that's one of the things which gets lost when people talk about suicide  the sheer magnitude of the decision to override your survival instinct and give up on everything  It's overwhelming and it's really  really hard   One other idea  just off the top of my head  is that if you really feel that MH services are not listening to you  is maybe you could contact PALS and ask for an advocate to go with you to speak to them  It sometimes helps if the service have made up their mind about you  and won't budge from their position  to have someone go in with you and lay it on the table from another perspective  You could always get a family member  friend  partner or someone to do this  but it sounded from your post that maybe an independent body would be more helpful to you  I know this still leaves you with a short term lack of support  But if you were going to think longer term  this migt be an option   I was obsessed with scars long before I started self harming  I'd say at least 50  of the reason I self harm overall is for the scars  probably more even  So just know you're not alone and it's definitely still "real self harm"  I am going through something very similar  I got drunk at a friends party and got sick everywhere and passed out in her garden  I had to get taken home by her parents   I am 17  This was a few months ago and I have apologised repeatedly but I don't think I will ever forgive myself  I know it sounds stupid but it everyone saw me in the worst possible state and I still get teased constantly  This event replays in my mind at least once a day and nobody seems to understand  I hate myself for it  Hey  How you doing   What's the difference  I'll be out of her life either way and she won't have any emotional attachments bonding her to me anymore  She'll know you killed yourself  and if she cares about you  that will hurt  I'm not trying to guilt you but if you care about this girl this is not the way to do things  you won't be sparing her It might not feel like it but it does kind of fade with time  Or at least it's not in the forefront of your mind taunting you all the time  One thing I've found helpful is to be really upfront with people who are teasing and turn the tables around so I am in control of the joke  So if they say "OMG you got so drunk and puked on yourself"  I'd usually respond with something like "Yeah  and there were no carrots in it  that's kind of weird  who doesn't puke carrots " or "Count yourself lucky  last time I did that I was naked"  or something similar  If it doesn't convince people  it usually confuses them so much they move on  or they then joke with you  rather than trying to make you feel bad  Thank you for your answer  My friends reaction was really nice i must say  i was called the ''legend man'' and ''king of the party'' No one took offense  But despite from their reaction i'm afraid that it will drag on me my whole life   i'm not sure if it is correct expression  Oh right I understand     Maybe it's just that you need to find someone then fall in love and then try sex  You don't absolutely know if you're asexual since you haven't tried it    But I know where you're coming from  I'm 23 and have only had sex 5 times  Didn't even have it with me long term boyfriend of almost 4 years  With me  I think there is something psychological behind it and I need to go to therapy  But I'm just scared to go   I think you have to be in love with someone to enjoy it or even want it   You will not be alone forever  I promise  i dont think you need to have sex for it  its normally in human nature to desire it  and its not like i never fallen in love before  i still never wanted to have sex with that person Hey  sorry I couldn't respond faster    Are you still there   You write like a poet  albeit a dark poet  but sometimes the raw unfiltered emotions need to be expressed    thrown up and vomited like poisonous bile   It can be helpful   You do say something interesting    the theme of not a man and not a boy    That transformation between boy to man isn't hidden away like a caterpillar becoming a butterfly   There is no cocoon to protect you during that major transformation   Humans do it all exposed  and it can be awful    as you well know     The biggest thing that seems to happen is that the explosion of emotions in the context of the great human unwashed is incredibly disorienting   I am sure that it feels like everything you learned was a lie    It wasn't a lie   it was oversimplified   In oversimplification we leave room for lots of exception to rules like  Work hard Tell the truth Don't hurt people  As we grow up  we see the hypocrisy of what we were taught    we learn that everyone lies et cetera   We also see how casual words can be    In spite of feeling like an inert abomination  I would suggest that you are not    Your earlier words of helping people suggests something contradictory     I'm not trying to argue with you    I just want to call out  that you should be cautious not to make yourself out worse than you are   The beautiful friends and family are trying to help you for a reason   I am on here  because in your short poetic beautifully descriptive compelling rant  I can see something cool and good    and young and not yet transformed into the man you will be   Don't give up yet   Not in the middle of the transformation   Please I can understand you being afraid of that  We are sort of defined by the things we do  But that's ALL the things we do  Not just one silly mistake at a party  It will be ok  if you let it be ok  Go out and do some awesome things with your life  and this will seem like such a tiny insignificant thing and very far away  Hey  not necessarily looking to change your mind    you seem set and activated to fix your handgun      Maybe we could talk though    like what kind of handgun  More importantly  you don't have the courage to hire a sex worker when you are about to kill yourself   Could we talk about that   Let's at least get you sexed before you go  Sounds like you are facing some tough situations    and it is all relative really  it might not be as bad as others  but it is yours    that's what makes it important   What's going on  That's wonderful to hear  and thank you for the update   we really appreciate it as most of the time we don't hear anything back  Here's to your new life  Same  I fell in completely in love with my ex  just never wanted to have sex with him  When he left me though  I wanted to experience it with him    I'm just scared because I want my own kids so bad in the next couple of years    But the 5 times I had sex  I had to hold back tears  There is just something I really fear about it  I just don't know  Hey  before you go  what do you care about  Anything  anyone   There must have been a time  where you laughed and smiled and said  this is pretty good   I don't know you  I know  but we do care  and we are here to be supportive if you want to vent  No  you were raped  If you can  please  please inform the authorities over this  You may want to visit  r rapecounseling as well  I'm so sorry you have to go through this  I kind of do it because it is expected of me   I only need to finish 2 more exams and i will be done    but I wasted so much time  I only have 3 weeks left and know nothing  So i really need to study but I cant bring myself to do so    Glad you didn't  but what happened between yesterday and today   What held you back yesterday   Would it not keep you from trying today   We are here for you   We do care  and if we can be here for you  so you can vent  we are here As someone who acts all cheerfully in the ER  it's not always about attention  It's about having extreme anxiety about going there for a self inflicted injury  it's about trying to avoid being put in a mental facility  it's about the fact that so many of us are used to pretending everything's oki doki around people  that we can't put that act down  even when getting stitched together at the ER   At least this is relevant to me  I avoid the ER at all costs  but if I have to go  I'll act like a bubbly happy girl  Ahh  Maybe you should take a break from each other for a while  let things clear your mind  a change in setting    They're stupid  of course they're going to bully you and make you feel shit  they raped you and are horrible people  They don't care about you but that doesn't mean nobody else does  Of course being raped is horrible  and I don't have the experience to help you get past that  but it most definitely isn't your fault and you   really   shouldn't blame it on yourself  I think if you feel really shitty  it's perfectly OK to want attention  In fact  I think it's kind of OK to want and seek out attention most of the time  Humans are social animals  we need other people  and if you're feeling isolated and sad  and posting here helps  then by all means  keep posting  No one is going to judge you here  We're here to listen if you need to vent  Hey  as far as I'm concerned  you can post here every day   Sometimes that's what life is about  getting through it one day at a time    eventually you reach an age  like I have  that says I am running out of time     I think you younger kids have so fricking much pressure on you all   How do you just not implode   It must be awful at times   So what's up with you    where do you think the depression is rooted   We are here  as much as we can    to be supportive  Hi OP  I'm sorry that there are so many problems piling up on top of you  Have you ever considered getting a counsellor or therapist to work through some of these feelings with   It's pretty obvious that your self isolation means you obviously lack social skills  Since you're feeling a bit suicidal  you should probably reach out to more people online  While we aren't as valuable as "irl friends " we still have a lot more time to listen to your complaints   Tbh  after reading this  I do recommend you ask to see a therapist  It's kind of clear your mental state is not in the greatest of shape right now  Understandable  though  but what's preventing you from connecting with others is your lack of initiation  It's pretty common  but you just have to take that overwhelming first step to go up to someone and initiate a conversation  You also have low self esteem  and I'm sorry to be blunt with it  Maybe you can try talking online  building more confidence  and transferring that to a situation in real life  I would care    PM me    Exactly  and in fact as a prospective screen writer you have an opportunity to make an impact on people to help explore and expand the use of language in more sophisticated ways How can I cut so deep  Because I'm an addict  Like a someone snorting cocaine  that needs more and more to get the same buzz  that can't stop themselves from going deeper and deeper every time  searching for the same buzz as the first time   I was terrified the first time I hit fat  then it stopped  Then I realized how much my body can handle and I started hacking away and mutilating my own body  day by day   I suggest you don't try to go deeper  to chase the buzz of gaping wounds  because eventually you're going to lose control  you're going to go beyond fat  down to muscle  damaging your body forever  severing nerves and losing the use of your limbs properly   That's my story  I am now sitting here with a deformed  almost useless  arm  I wasn't there when that went down  but I'm glad you managed to get past that stuff  mate  Well done  It was hard to tell her the first time  You hide your scars from others and make up excuses when they're noticed  That's not manipulative at all   It's normal to feel good about opening up to people  It's normal to want to do something more if it makes you feel accepted and your feelings validated  this applies to showing people scars too  Unfortunately when it comes to SH this can be seen as trying to manipulate people  but if you're not  actively trying  to manipulate people then you  aren't  manipulating people  Uhhh    so what are you thinking   If you feel that you are in danger to yourself or to others  we are here to be supportive of you     Presumably that is why you are here   Maybe not   I had a similar day    I don't think that's attention seeking  Scars might be like tattoos for you  read up on  scarification   Not sure  I want to know the ending of GoT  But that seems a stupid reason  Everyone are making big steps in live like becoming parents  getting married etc  Other than that I would like to travel the world  That sucks  What made you feel like it was a waste of time  I don't know  Some people love to hurt others  I can't explain that because I'm the complete difference  I hate myself when someone gets hurt because of me  so I can't sleep anymore  am not eating etc      I personally don't think any reasons are stupid reasons  Even if it's sticking around to find out what happens on a TV show  then hey  why not    People do things at their own pace  The traditional trajectory of "adult choices" don't suit everyone  Maybe you need to find your own things to believe in  Travelling might open up all kinds of new adventures and perspectives  I mean  if you hate it  you can still choose suicide later  it's always an option which is there  but it will be the last option  Anywhere in particular which you'd like to visit  I think we talked a few days ago   Is this just for conversation    For argument sake  and maybe you don't want to hear this  but sometimes being social creates the "luck" by creating connections  I want to talk to you  I do not know what "placing a plague" suppose so mean  and whatever it is I'm not scared  Reply so I can share some details   Then I'm not surprised that you don't feel it was worth it  That sounds like you either got the wrong kind of therapy  or a therapist who didn't know what they were doing  I'm sorry you had that experience    They'll understand how unimportant to them I am   That doesn't make sense  If you were unimportant to them  they wouldn't care if you died  But you even said yourself that they would care  People do care  If you weren't wanted  your parents would have got rid of you when you were younger  Even  if  you think noone cares  there are people that do  Sit and think about what it would cause  and all the things you would miss out on  and the things that those that care about you would miss out on  People do care and you can seek help  If it becomes really unbearable and you are in treat of seriously harming yourself you may want to check into your local hospitals ER  You deserve help all right  You don't need to suffer  I concur with others  Help spread the kindness   I'm here  I'm reading everything  I meant like I feel like an ocean and each time I storm I erode a piece of the people closest to me I don't have any wise words to offer  but I wanted to say I understand how frustrating that must be  To be honest  your friend needs to stop doing that  It must be exhausting to worry like that to the extent that you run to hers to make sure she's okay  It's not fair on you   PM me  I'm going through terrible heartbreak myself right now  Would love some camaraderie  No one in my life seems to care about my pain anymore  They just want to be critical   Hey there  I hope you are still with us OP  What you describe soudns like depression  and while the social stigma on that is still immense  it is possible to treat most forms of depression  try to seek proffesional help  Best of luck  Oh I know how much they care  I know all of what I would do to them  I know it's selfish  I know it's dumb   I'm in a similar place in my life  If you want to chat  PM me  I'd love for the opportunity to help someone else to get my mind off my own suckiness   That's terrible  I'm here if you want to talk Ok  so this is clearly an unusual and shitty situation for you   Betrayal is never a good feeling   Heartbroken by love is like a death    but as hard as this sounds  in the general scheme of things  it is not worth suicide     Romantic love is just not worth someone's life   My opinion  but truly  that hype of dying for love has been overhyped since Romeo and Juliet   It is a harmful idea    beautiful and symbolically romantic    but just silly     I am glad you are seeing him for the reality    I am sorry  so  so sorry  you had to endure the pain to see the reality    but you are better off for it   We are always here if you want need to vent more   We cannot solve  but we can be supportive    And I am sorry if I'm being assumptive  and I don't mean to trivialize any of your pain   If my words read that way  I apologize    It's not selfish and it's not dumb  But it's worth spending some time properly thinking about the consequences  I assume you want help  but the sad thing is that help takes time  I'm sure your family will be entirely willing to help you if you talk to them about it  but it's a decision that shouldn't be taken without a lot of thought  from both you and others  I've had help before  It really just boils down to the fact my brain is fucked up and I can't be happy  I'm just tired of thinking   19M also from the UK that was very strange to read  it felt like I wrote this  I feel exactly this way lonely and all and quite handsome  Are we twins  XD I know what this will do to them  I warned them last night that they're talking to a wall  I'm just numb to it but I can't take it   Completely agree that college will not only get you away from the environment that is making you depressed  but will also be a completely fresh start and great experience  This might not be your thing but applying for a ROTC scholarship and pledging a few years of military service can completely cover college Only you think so  When you feel very depressed  you automatically assume everyone around feels somewhat the same  but in reality they don't  I know how it feels  Do you think it's a good idea that I never had sex with him  I'm just regretting it right now  I will never get to experience that with him  Sigh  I'm just beyond it  I posted here mostly because I want to write out my thoughts before I go  It's sad  I know what will happen to them but  They'll be fine in the end   I know and I wanted to take it last saturday but as I wrote this shit broke my motivation on everything    Not sure where I wanna go  maybe something like canada or something  I like mountains and forests  I'm just tired of needing people  I don't deserve their help   You're fine  I'm just regretting not having intercourse with him  And it's a terrible feeling  But barely anyone knows what actually happened    I'm still so heartbroken 8 months later  I'm doing all I can to move on  I loved him so much  I don't even know what I think of him now Yeah i think it probably was  He doesn't really seem to be a sexually responsible kind of guy  not really the kind of guy you should have any 'experiences' with  EVERYONE in this planet needs help of other people  we would all go insane otherwise    I for instance cannot function properly without encouregment of others  During this holiday I felt very lonely  but I got to know someone here  who gave my life new meaning  I just want to know more people  I want to know what's wrong with you   Since I made it through the day  I'll share the note in the original post  I changed names but otherwise its all there   I wrote more today  per your suggestion and it might have kept me around  You made a difference  You seem like  you have a lot of problems on your mind  But you can't really tackle them properly all at once  PM me  maybe we can find where to start  I really want to talk to someone right now   I just   things have always been hard financially  And I've always made it work  and everyone is so impressed with all that I've done  But I know how hard it was  and I know what it's like to go without food or heat or whatever because that's just how it is   And I bought a house  Yay  That was more than a year ago    it made more sense than renting with my dog  it was cheaper long run  and there was a discount payment because I'm a teacher     Anyway  fast forward and I have friends that run into hard times  And I let them stay with me  for free  as they get their lives back together  Because I knew what that would have meant for me   and they've been shitty about it  Because obviously you can't help people  People end up in these places because of who they are    But as I'm floating the household  financial bullshit comes up over and over  my nest egg is gone  I'm still paying bills but it's only through careful overdrafts and it's been so so long since I was not stressed but I had a plan          And then more bullshit happened  And so I don't know what the point is  Being stressed over money is just my future for the next forever   You were brave to share this here  I don't want to repeat what everyone else has said  My heart goes out to you  I hope you can find the courage to tell your parents  As a mom  I swear to god I would do whatever it took    WHATEVER IT TOOK    to help my son recover from trauma such as this  It is not your fault  100xs over  it is not your fault  People are available out there who can help you   Is it possible it seems more severe to her than it actually is  If you look at a certain way  there really isn't a huge amount of space between the surface and an artery  On the other hand  if you're looking at it millimetre by millimetre there's probably a fair amount   I don't think they will  I know you want to die but think about how you would  honestly  feel in their position  losing your child  Depression is a bitch but  as ironic and as much of a lie as it sounds  things will change    Why do you feel the way you do  Is there anything you can do about it  I know you feel bad but just hold on and see what tomorrow brings  Huh  regretting intercourse    I would imagine it may hint at the possibility of changing history     perhaps    but I doubt you would have changed the character of his person    I am happy to know you are moving in  Being busy and active can be a good thing  Helping others in SW helps me actually   Always I love people  Dont underestimate that  Haha I look at my friends and I feel something I've never felt anywhere  Just my constant feeling of undeserving it is hurting them  There's no way to fix me  I'm negative  I'm toxic  I refuse to let them be exposed to another minute of my bullshit   I figured that as much  but if she hates me then it won't hurt nearly as much  y'know  But she doesn't hate you That's not what I am or was saying suggesting  Again it's your decision on how to approach this   Haha you sound like my best friend  I constantly weigh out the Goods and the bads  seeing the things ahead of me that I have planned really do make me excited  I just think my toxicity is getting to my friend's  They'll be a lot happier if I wasn't around fucking up everything and needing them all the time   No  You are not a "gross slut"   Those men deserve to be put in jail for what they did   I say this as someone who cares  please  report them   Don't kill yourself   You can sit in that court room and watch those men be put away for 40  years  It might seem more severe to her  I don't know what she thinks  and I don't mind if she calls texts me asking to come over because she wants to be with someone  but it feels to me like she was lying to me  Did anyone say that to you or is it just your assumptions  Because to my view it's just low self esteem  and it's very easy  OK MAYBE NOT VERY  to improve  To me you seem like a person who values other people at his own cost  I just have to think even if I did have sex with him  this probably still would have happened   So in the end it's probably good I never had intercourse with him    I'm trying my hardest to move on  It's just extremely hard at times  It's just not a typical break up  Has she behaved in a manipulative way in the past  Nope  I just can't wait until the day karma comes back for him in some form or another  But I don't need to linger on it Dude  please don't   You probably hate hearing "oh  just go to the ER " That's not what I am here to tell you   You can keep living  beat cancer  enjoy life   As for the loneliness  it is OK   You can always meet someone  Hell  I haven't kissed a girl in lord knows how long   I am happy  and that is what I want you to be  You're right  but it's good you're willing to talk about it  Here if you need me  I'm dead serious  it shocked me so much I made a throw away just to comment  Haha I am   It hurts to have to rely on people  I would go to the ends of the earth for any of them  no questions asked   i can relate  Matching with someone even if it is only for a moment in your life is a pretty cool thing  It's so hard when you are feeling so down while at the same time feeling love for someone else is so confusing  We aren't supposed to give advice but maybe talking to her more about your feelings is a good idea  Things may not get better or feel better but at least communicating with someone will make the world seem less small Hey man  I may not have been in our situation before  but I know how it feels to be alone   It's hard    A work project kept my mind off of her until November   Why don't you do another project  maybe one at your community   You could see her again  talk to her  be happy   Thank you  I generally dislike them  I have a X shaped scar on my wrist I find myself looking at a lot  It reminds me of the events that drove me to do that  Not sure if that's a good or bad thing really  well    It's really hard to have passion for helping others nowadays  because you dont really know how can you help them  However  this is yet again a common problem   Anyway you think you overwhelm others with your sadness   Yeah it certainly is a grand feeling but hard to comprehend when you tell yourself  you swear to yourself not to fall in love again  I've been doing that a lot with her  it certainly feels less small  I just can't believe I've entrapped somebody else in my web of fucking hate and despair   Well  maybe he wasn't the right one to speak with  Just like doctors  not all are the right fit  but that doesn't mean you should avoid doctors altogether when you need to see one  The following article might help as far as searching for a good one goes  https   www psychologytoday com blog freudian sip 201102 how find the best therapist you   You might also try one of the links I'd already shared     But the point is that just because you might've spoken to one bad therapist doesn't mean another one won't be helpful  There are plenty of other options out there  that one link in my first response from greatist com lists a whole bunch of alternatives too     Good luck  You don't need to suffer alone  help is out there  Please hang in there     Thanks and peace be with you  You're welcome  Stay strong  I don't mean to be rude but I've just looked through your comment history and seen your post on  r RaisedByNarcisists about your sister's friend  You seem like a really great person caring about someone that you barely know like that  I'd be surprised if people would rather you didn't be around  I used to feel exactly the same  I thought that people didn't want to be around me  and to an extent  I still do  But I cut ties  if that's the right word  with my old group of friends  bar one   and tried to find new ones  It took a while  and I felt alone  But it gave me time to think about things and what I wanted to do  But now things are a lot better  and although times I still feel unwanted  I know deep down that I am  and it's purely depression that's making me feel like that  I still spend a lot of time alone  just browsing the internet or playing games  and it takes my mind off things when I'm feeling down    Anyway  to get back on track  Try to find change  I'm sure you feel lost but just doing something different can make you feel better  Cut ties with people if you must  but just try to keep going  Please  I can't promise change immediately  but if you stick at it  I can promise from first hand experience that it will get better eventually  Not yet  She's bound to when she sees how awful i am Well  I don't know  but she does always show off her wounds  if she scratches her thighs she wears shorts  if she scratches her arms  she wears t shirts  so obviously she is needing attention  Then treat her well  She likes who you are  be yourself You might want to at least consider it  If there are things that you don't want to tell her  that's okay  but open communication can be a wonder  And  perhaps  even if she doesn't understand right away  this is something that she  could  understand   I'm not sure I do understand  Why does it feel fake  What makes you think that they don't want you there  I used to think the same thing about my friends   I thought they just dealt with me being there  that they were neutral about me at best  But  I talked to some people about it  again  communication can be such a huge help sometimes    and I heard that my close friends really did care about me  It was just my poor self esteem that was clouding my perception of my relationships   And you're so welcome  I'm glad this is at all helpful  How can i be myself when i don't even know who i am  why i do the things i do  Ask her who you are Yeah  that does sound like she's just doing it for attention  In that case  I think the solution would be to find the cause of the attention seeking behaviour  I can't really offer any advice on that  though  I don't know enough   Got too drunk and sad last night  Ended up in a circle of all my friends comforting me  but I hate the way their eyes look at me now  Especially the ones closest to me  They're just getting tired of me   Sigh  I just wish I was stronger   I'm glad to read this  Stay strong dude  Like  I think I'm going to keep going  There's something here worth fighting for  But I'm really tired of trying and failing and beating myself up so often   I just wanted to say a massive thank you to everyone on here who replied  Thank you for your support  She is a lot better now and is happy when we are talking  I am doing well myself  I got in touch with Samaritans and also have some really great friends that got me through the tough time  Thank you all so much  TBH I think I know why  she lives in a home for troubled teens  she's very violent  and I think she might feel rejected by her parents or something  People who obviously copycat off each other and have well placed  aesthetic scars created to evoke attention  Also will act like a know it all if u are discussing this subject  Sometimes this can be just immaturity though   Dealing with a lot of this type of person in my life recently  On two occasions they put me near to forceful discovery and the consequences  They have also not helped with the state of my mental health by blowing up whenever I dare to even hint at SH with them  while freely discussing these subjects among themselves   RANT   She'll just tell me all of this fake  'positive' stuff about me which isn't true  She just thinks it is because she's delusioned herself into thinking i'm a good person Then be that good person  for both of your sakes  I love seeing bigger scars  To me it is a sign that effort was not wasted and that more pain is on show  I must go over healed scratches until the area becomes a dark blotch  Well  then it sucks because you value them more than they value you  which is not healthy in any way  Honesly I don't think your problems are that bad  you just need to make new friends  new connections  And no  I'm not saying you need to ditch everyone you connected before  you just need to find someone with who you can be open  and not judged to death  quite literally haha   If you have something you want to talk about  you can PM me  right now I'd gladly listen   The fact that you're going to keep going shows that you   are   strong  I know it feels hard but you're right  there's definitely something worth fighting for  Failure sucks but it happens to everyone and it's not worth beating yourself up over  It's not a big deal  you can learn from it and make sure not to make the same mistakes in the future  I'm really glad you've decided to carry on and  if you  ever  need someone to talk to    please   PM me  I hope everything becomes better for you    I appreciate your wanting to help  but please review the sidebar guidelines before helping further   there are some perhaps surprising but important reasons that making a "here to help" post and inviting private contact as a first resort can both backfire  so I've had to take this post down    If you have any questions the sidebar and the links from the sidebar doesn't answer  you're welcome to ask  Thank you  Thanks bub  Every inch of me is telling me to do it still  but the calm in my heart is just giving me a list of shit that I need to do   sorry  Im not regular reddit user   Can you get a family member to come pick you up and go looking for him  I wish i could  but there's no good in me  Perhaps there was a long time ago  but whatever good there was in me is long gone  Haha the thing is they're the most accepting  perfectly healthy group for me  I just think that continually watching their friend never improves and suffer does something to them   You're wrong and she knows that  If she wants to help you let her Can you contact any of his friends  Hey Bud  I'm thinking of you  Your story about your old GF really touched me  She made you feel like you were worth something for once and I totally get that  I don't know if I can help you  this notion of help can be so rediculous anyways  Let's just say I am young and feel very much for you and your experiences  Message me if you want to talk to someone  I never comment here  read it everyday  and something you said makes me want to talk to you  If we never talk  I'll think of you for a long time  That's understandable  Just let us know if anything doesn't make sense     If you have any trouble finding it  if you're on mobile sometimes it's not as straightforward to find   there's a link in the welcome message you received after your first comment here  or you can go to  r SuicideWatch about sidebar   I get u  I will stop when I feel the need to stop  although I could reduce frequency beforehand to please family members  friends and therapists  I especially hate hypocrisy from other cutters  I am likely no more brave or held together than u are  In fact the more u tell me ur story  the more I am tempted to find out if what u tell me is true    Especially when the urges have kicked in  As they say  change has to come from within  and as long as u are not a danger to urself u are fine   I have done that  hoping someone will see him and tell me I'm gonna use my grandma's car when she gets back  Sorry you're going through all of this  your parents  depression  all of it   Your parents  especially your dad  sound really stubborn and painful to deal with  She may not feel that way  I get how it seems you are a sinking ship dragging and sucking people down with you  I can't say it will go away but talking to her and making her understand how you are feeling is one snap that could be in the right direction  Yeah hey I'm still here  I've been diagnosed with and prescribed medication for clinical depression  I'm not convinced that's the whole story  but I'm going to a counselor too  Both paths haven't done much to help me and it's only hurt worse the more time spent just not understand the basic foundation on how to be  Ah  definently let's hope  I've gone through this it's really fucking terrifying isn't it I'm still here  Thanks for your words  I know a lot of this stuff in my head  I've always been a big picture sort of guys  it's just I've seen myself tumble into something I hate and I've done it to myself just because of who I am and the perspective on life I had developed  I do feel like a sort of Frankenstein monster  whether I think helping people is a good thing or not  I can't and won't do it  I'm very lazy  and I'm going to stagnate as a person and die alone while everyone else prances through life  This is how I feel  and I know it to be warped  but it's how I feel  and how I've felt for a very long time  and it's hard to finally get help for all of this and find out that it doesn't help either and I'm still the quivering jelly mass I always was  But thanks Horrifying  I'm so scared I can barely breathe  In my case my employer has an EAP  employee assistance program   It gave me 5 free visits a year  My current doc gives me a slight break  Though 2016 had been the costliest I have ever had  I can't burden somebody as pure as her like that  this is better for everybody It's like no matter what i do  its never right  i hurt people and i don't stop  hurt people  hurt people  I'm talking to her rn and its hurting her so much It's either the burden of support or the burden of loss  We both know the former is lighter Pm'd thanks  I already do talk to one  but the problem is that therapy is a very female dominated field and she and other women seem to really not understand  She doesn't understand to the degree that she calls me a mysoginist and thinks that using accusatory Socratic questioning counts as therapy  when in reality I've never done anything to harm women in any way  It makes me hate myself more and I don't think I can go to any other therapists  Also  If you read what I wrote in that pastebin  you'd know I don't believe that society accepts men  so how can I accept myself  Sigh  I hear you  I don't know where you are  but in the States  the medical industry has become such a profit driven suck hole it's disgusting   And health insurance is almost a joke  You pay an arm and a leg just to have health insurance  and when you actually need to use it  you have to pay even more towards your deductible copay specialist fees etc   Or worse  they refuse to pay for things they should be covering   And if you  don't  have insurance  I just started a new job  and mine won't kick in until next month   well good luck       Some places will try to work with you if you have no insurance  though  so your best bet is just to check everywhere you can   Or try to find a free clinic  if you're in the US  not sure if they have anything similar elsewhere    I don't know if they offer mental health services  but it's better than nothing  and they might be able to help you find some low cost mental health counseling   Just keep trying    3 He turned his phone off I guess  I just don't know what I can do  The feeling presses more and more that she doesn't want me and I was just a thing for her to pass time with  The rejection is just obliterating  and especially after a recent break up  it's all I can think about and she's on my mind all the time  I just think she'd be negative about it and reject anything I have to say  I feel like she wouldn't care anyway even if I did  abs I'd just end up back to where I am now   I just feel like any enjoyment isn't actually there because as soon as I begin to feel enjoyment  I remember the feeling I have in my chest  and it just crumbles  and even if I do laugh or I enjoy something  that's still this constant pull at me that reminds me how awful I feel  I feel like if I did talk to my friends about it they'd just lie to me or shrug it off or abandon me all together  I feel like nothing is in my control and that everything in my life is in limbo and I'm helpless and I just can't take this amount of hurt for any longer  it seems strangely inevitable to end it all in a way  I don't see how else it could stop  Fuck it sucks  Have you contacted police  You could tell them the car he's driving and his appearance and see if they can keep an eye out  Yeah  depression doesn't need a reason  It's chemicals in your brain  they don't a reason to do what they do  He just made a  6 debit at boost mobile  could that be to change his number  He's paranoid and thinks people are hacking him and following him  he's had 3 numbers since we've been home and snapped 2 smart phones and had a flip phone when I saw him  I called the number associated with boost mobile and tried to put in his phone number which he had today and it's not recognizing it  could that be a phone number change charge   He pulled the battery out yeah Not sure if this is allowed  please let me know if it's not  mods  and I'll delete it   but if you're in the US  this site will find free and low cost clinics in your area   http   www findcare org Do you believe in the afterlife  Same life is so meaningless It's a good thing you can realize that and move forward    I will tell you from experience that each breakup is unique in its pain  The salve is always the same though    it is time    Being busy helps make time pass faster    I am glad you won't end your life over this  If you need to chat  feel free to reach out I feel that it would satisfy my self esteem and make me feel more comfortable and secure  if I had been born that way  not If I transitioned  Farewell then  random redditor  May your afterlife be a lot better than this one  How much does it cost you per session that passes the 5 a year limit  and how long are sessions if you don't mind me asking  While that might not offer you much comfort as I am only a stranger on the internet  I precisely know how you feel  From your post history I determined we are around the same age right now  me just being two years older  I just feel so aimless  just drifting along with what feels right in some kind of apathy  Whenever my own lack of goals overwhelms me I try to keep in mind that I dont face this struggle alone  our entire generation has so much possibilitys to choose from and so much information available to us that the abundance of possibilitys just becomes more clear  which just eliminates the option to make any choice that feels good  because we could always be doing that other thing that feels just slightly more fitting for us as a person   Regarding your therapy  the succees of it largly depends on how well you can work with your therapist  if it dosent lead to positive results dont be too scared to switch    I hope this whole text was as coherent as i thought it was  english is not my native language and Im getting fairly sleepy     I will be going to bed now  Ill check back on this thread as soon as I can  hang in there    What did you study Do you have a job Why the fuck am I even replying to this  Literally no one cares  The only reason you responded is because you either felt bad if you didn't or because you respond to almost every thread  Im just a pathetic Meanwhile whiner  trying to seek attention on a subreddit meant for real problems  Meanwhile  the people on the front page actually have real problems  I have no real problem  I live in a middle class household  I get an okay education  and I'm supplied with everything I need for life on a silver platter  I seriously need to have something bad happen to me  I need to be beaten  raped  tortured  abused  I need to have some reason to be sad  It's what I deserve  I wish someone would rape my filthy body  I wish somebody would go through the effort to beat my ugly face  But they wont  nobody will because they know I'm too pathetic to even waste their time with me  I don't blame people for not caring I really don't  If I were dealing with me I probably would not care either  even me  as stupid as I am  would be perceptive enough to know how dumb  worthless  stupid  ugly  pretentious  filthy  pathetic  self pitying  and gross I am  If anyone is reading this  please kill me  I'm too much of a coward to do it myself so just please do it for me  Message me and I'll give you my address so you can come find me and do it  I can give you my credit card number in return or something like that   I'm scared to because his license is good in Georgia but not here so he'd just get arrested and I fear that will make it worse   but I dunno what else I can do at this point and I'm leaning towards calling the cops  This isn't my main issue  I have made more serious posts   it's just something that's been bugging me and I felt like I needed to vent it somewhere  and it's correlated with my suicidal ideation so I felt it was okay to post here  You've commented on my other post as well  You aren't really much help  if you don't have something good to say on this subreddit don't say anything at all  Just like how you told me "ummmm   just enjoy life " How is that supportive or helpful  same man  Hang in there  Contemplating calling the suicide hotline  but I don't want to get put in the looney bin  a centimetre is just under half an inch  2 5's of an inch   do you mean millimetre  1 25 of an inch   Tell her to be more honest with you about the depth of her wounds  and that she doesn't need an excuse to hang out with you  That it's human to want attention  but she's going about it the wrong way and getting only negative forms of attention this way  If you go to the same school  assuming you're school aged   speak to your guidance counselor about it   you need support just as much as she does  even if they tell her parents or guardian  which they should    your  mental health  always  comes first  You can be a good friend and be there for her and need your own support network  too   I didn't have very many friends in high school and just kinda coasted along  It's tough when you have to see someone almost every day but just try not to pay any attention to her and do your best to still be considerate but I know it's difficult   If he just changed his number today then I'm guessing he's not planning on doing anything harmful to himself anytime soon    Interesting stuff  Biology was one of my favourite subjects in my former school  Dropped out from there though because I didn't want chose to go to this school  I guess being in a place where you dont want to be   dont feel comfortable dosent help you gain the necessary diciplin motivation you need to do well    Now I'm at a different school with a focus on art   design  but sadly that also means we don't have biology here   It's all up to you  and if you've exhausted all your resources I would call the police  I can't tell you why you are in therapy either  If the therapist believes he or she can help you  then it makes sense  If they are trying to do something that isn't possible  like curing the flu by talking to it  then not so much  Being willing to endure discomfort to make progress is admirable          Being willing to self harm either emotionally or physically  is a problem in and of itself  I can't tell you how to stop  All I can say is that it is a very good idea to stop that  How  That's beyond me  Being afraid of yourself isn't too surprising under those circumstances  I am more than willing to offer you all the support I can  but the heavy lifting has to be yours  Take care   No  I think I'll just stop brain function and be nothing   That's why I'm asking if that's what that is  that's a good thing if he's changing his number  Very true  There are days where I don't want to get out of bed  I'm just so exhausted from everything  Sometimes I don't even want to go to work  It doesn't help that I don't have many people in my life either  I'm hoping that'll change soon  I have a business degree   I'm working a shitty manual labor job that I suspect is making me sick   I work with chemicals and shit   Have you ever seen "magic" or perceptual illusions that trick your brain into believing something that isn't real   Emotions can be that way   Emotions are good and powerful   They can motivate us and tear us apart     You feel many things    and many of them are negative    but I suspect there are objective truths that are obscured or foggy based on the perceptual goggles your emotions slap over your eyes    For example "quivering jelly mass" is quite poetic    and I'm sure it is such a romantic idea to be helplessly helpless    but I do believe that there are things that do motivate you   What would that be  I wonder   Sorry to say but it's impossible to die only from Xanax  Benzodiazepines toxicity alone are very low    You gonna end in ER Define "nothing"    We used to go to the same school  but we're adults now  Well   Kind of adults  Anyway  I'll try to sit down and have a chat with her about it  making sure she knows I'm not trying to berate her or put her down  Your life will always mean something  please know that    PM me if you need  I feel felt the same way  But one thing you need to realize is that  that is how life goes  I have two friends and both of them are becoming memories at each of their own respective paces  One is almost a memory seeing that I hardly see him  And the other is settling down and getting ready to make that transition  I've had a pretty hard life and a really fucked up family  but terminating yourself isn't going to solve the problem  you just have to get out there more and live your life    True  life is based on the perception that people create based on their environment and societal experience  but you can always choose to what you want that societal experience to be like the environment can also change  but most of the times it takes longer because of the financial factor involved and that's something else that triggers other obstacles that we have to deal with  If you hold on you can slowly start making life better little by little    If you want a significant other  then go out there and talk to people  don't care if they're a 8 10 10 physically  give a care about how they connect with you  About how they make you feel as a person when you're with them  If you can spend 1hr with this person and it makes you feel like only 20mins have passed then you're on the right track    If you hate your job  well welcome to the club  but also don't forget that you're not a slave to them  go out there with your best suit or dress on and hit those job applications hard    This is all easier said than done  but everything in life is like that  Push yourself everyday to do better  not for anyone  but for yourself    I don't mind being a ghost or lonely  it's better that way  while I'm accomplishing things  it's better that no unwanted person notices  My girlfriend notices and she's a hell of positive person and that's all that matters  My negative individuals in my life that's cool they don't notice fuck them  let them keep being idiots  I don't need their commentary on what I'm doing    Remember you hit rock bottom  what else is their left to do     GO UP AND START CLIMBING OUT OF THE HOLE  Once you're out  come visit this ghost he'll have an open seat  a nice warm hug and a cold drink waiting for you  I couldnt tell you  I'm not familiar with the States phone companies  Maybe check their website or ring up a store and ask what could cost 6 bucks  Might give you an idea of what he bought or what service he purchased  Definitely a good sign anyway I care so no you can't end it sorry  Just leave town  Never go back  Completely cut off everything and everyone  It's not the best circumstance to move forward  but I'd rather have a chance at something going right somehow   Some time in the future  you decide who to let back in  Be strict  The current option is to cut off everyone now  permanently  hahaha  every day is a day I want to stay in bed    but things need to get done   Growing up  working  parenting are all things  that may  or may not  change how you even view exhaustion   Many of my peers are like me  and we are constantly exhausted    We don't paint a nice picture of parenting really     What would happen that it will change   I ask that  because typically  it will change if we make it change  Ugh  economic issues can be such a burden   I feel your pain on that    it get's tougher when there are kids involved   It is a such a stress  isn't it   From a practical standpoint  I cannot help you at all    in fact  please  someone help me lol  I have been trying to explore r personalfinances more      I do know this  I am not ending my life over money   I will fight and scrape and whatever  before I end my life for money  Ah  yeah that  I was honestly just using it ad part of the metaphor  it was late and I wasn't really thinking  thanks for the correction   I've done that once  I dont want to do it again  I just want to die  No more lonely nights  no more lonely days  I just need something to take the pain away  now the drugs don't work  Well  I read a good thing here on Reddit once  But I'll feel  or not feel  each of my cells die  and slowly my brain will cease to fire  My thoughts will stop  Being conscious will no longer be a possible concept  Sigh  Dammit  I was going to mix with buesbar   The problem is that I'm coming here from  r all and I've made a gut response  Now that I've read all the posting guidelines  I'm trying my best to do the right thing  I don't believe our relationship will ever be the same   But even if I do see talk to her  what's the point  What I am doing is wrong  even if it wasn't  I'll never get that happiness back  Thank you so much  This did help me  And also thank you for not judging me  Much love  Or sleeping pills   You are not a slut at all  Please don't listen to terrible people like that  Please go to the police    they need to be stopped before they do this again to you or someone else  You did nothing wrong  I am so terribly sorry this happened to you  you did not deserve it   Hey man  please  I know it's tough but please think this through     Yes  life is tough  And yes  your situation is terrible  But is it worth ending the only thing you get  Please  no  Please  go out there  hold strong  and live for yourself     And talk  I'm always here   Mitch  BurnTheMitch  God no  This is awful  Those people are just horrible  You should go to the police  even tough I know it's difficult    I know it's not much coming from an anonymous on the internet  but you have all my love and support  and  I hope you'll get trough this  Hope we'll hear from you again soon  He has made two purchases  one for 21 even at a gas station meaning he probably topped it off to being even and got gas  Hoping this is a good sign     Still nothing though You don't have to   I only posted on here so I can get everything I've wanted to say off my chest  thank you for listening  I'll be starting grad school in a couple of weeks  hopefully I'll meet people there    You're a parent  I can't wait to be a mother one day  I hope to find someone to have children with   I've had two blood transfusions due to self harm  The first time I was admitted with a Hb  haemoglobin   red cell count  of 6 4g dl  I was very ill  and if I had self harmed that evening before I went to hospital then I might have died  My resting heart rate was 120bpm and I couldn't really stand up  I wasn't refused blood in fact I wasn't given a choice  if I refused they'd have sectioned me and done it without me consent   If your Hb is that low you need a blood transfusion and likely an iron infusion as well  you must have lost a lot of blood  Please keep me informed  I'd like to know how you get on    jjuuuu I barely know you from the RH discord  but would love the chance to get to know you more    You have the ability to affect positive change in others  like the RH discord    no matter how small you feel right now   I can't know the full depths of your struggle  but I would like to better understand  and help you to get better  Your background  is  important  Know that I  along with many others  are rooting for you  and we're all willing and ready to support you in any way we can     A Universal Sigh 21 so much time left to change things brotha  Seems like depression   Don't blame yourself  and like Sephen Fry said  when you have that kind of mental disorder  your emotions are like the weather  "if you go outside and it's raining  it's not you that made it rain  it has rained and it is real  You can't unthink the weather  The weather makes up it's own mind" When you see it in that angle it seems ridiculous when you hear people say "it your fault it's raining" "you made it rain because you didn't want to go to school" "just get it together and the sun will come out"    Go see someone  it's normal to get help when you're in pain  and more importantly don't blame or stress yourself just because it seems you can't get out of it  I know it did for 3 years before discovering I needed help   Really hope you'll get better    Lots of love  I am so sorry that you are in pain   I hope you will get through this   Do you have anyone at all that you can trust to talk to  I don't know how I could help  and even tough I know it doesn't mean much coming from a complete stranger  I'm sending all the love and toughs I can to you   Nevertheless if you somehow feel like you need to talk to someone  i'm here  This is a bad period in your life   I hope you will get through it   Reach out to someone   A suicide hotline   Can you see a counsellor   There will be hope at the other side of this  but right now you need to talk through your problems with someone  Like I said on the other post  you are not a slut  You did not give them consent and they raped you while you were influenced by alcohol when they knew you couldn't make up your mind  They should be charged as adults with rape and underage intoxication  Through the toughest of times  you question gods existence but it's through these times you have to believe and have faith  Go out and be confident because nobody's thinking anything bad about you  Start life over and find the true values of it   3 we are here for you    Edit  Also watch motivational videos on YouTube that for sure will help    Maybe you didn't give him enough space to recover from such a shock  Then again  he was in no right to act like that  Soon enough  once he clears his head  he'll realize and regret his actions   hopefully  If you're not depressed  then you can help yourself   Get out of the rut you've put yourself in and try someone you've never tried before   Do something you're scared of   Do something for someone else   Do something  If you are depressed  please get help   It sounds as if you are very young   Is there any way you can see a counsellor   link her to this post Please notify the police and keep us updated  You can talk to us  Also   Discord  https   discordapp com   is a great place to meet other people with similar interests  I have approximately 2 or so friends outside of Discord but on there I have dozens who I keep in touch with on a daily basis and share close personal relations with  reaching as far as exchanging phone numbers and snapchats  Give it a try    Have you searched for an LGBT organization in your aera   I'm told they are very helpful in that situations  to listen  give advice  and you might meet some people who have been trough similar situations   I know you life might seems hopeless right now  but if you have one of these in your aera  give it a try  maybe you'll find some support an answers   I really hope it'll all get better for you     Thanks for replying  I hope you can find something you're into that you do just for you  The older I get  the more I see that the people who are happy take time to do what they need to do for themselves  For me  it's writing  For my man  it's running  It was hard for me to take time for it bc it felt selfish  but I figure you do whatever it takes for your mental health  Take care  SleepEnigma  I am sorry to hear you are ill  and nobody seems to care  I hope you feel better soon  Is it unusual that you have to study during break   Talking to your parents will definitely help  no matter how bad the situation is your parent can listen and will do their utter most best to help you  It wasn't your fault and I became less funny and quieter throughout my high school years so that's not just you and it's no uncommon because a lot of people do   You realize OP said his friend is dead  right  He's not going to clear his head    Are you still married   I can't remember if you said you still were  but that CAN work   I don't want to go into all that romance y glop  but things do tend to get better  Us redditors would care and I'm sure more people than you think would That really sucks  I can understand not wanting some random person to find out  I would suggest you try find the school policy on SH or another school's or the government's guide on making one to see what happens in cases of SH in your school country  That way you would have a better idea of what happens  As far as talking to the school psychologist goes  do even if it means your parents being told  I was petrified about mine finding out but it went much better than I expected  I've seen some of your posts on SHP and those really could do with some help for  So long story short  yes  you should talk to the school psychologist  Good luck    You are obviously in a lot of pain from the disconnect between your physical and emotional realities  My mom is ignoring me  but she text messaged his mom and said that he is there and he's sober and safe  I feel like a massive Boulder was taken off my chest  Suddenly I can breathe again  Thank you all for listening  Hopefully everything is going to be okay    Sorry to say  but my friend already committed suicide  He did so many irrational things when he was alone  The dude's whole life was a mess  Honestly I believe if I didn't help sooner  things would've gotten way worse quicker  It sounds as if you've had some tough things to deal with already  and you are still very young   Do you have a live person you can trust to talk to  Actually your family may develop depression would could lead to suicide so option 2 as your family would care and would be more encouraging than anyone you would imagine    trust me  You're welcome  Anything else you'd like to talk about  You've probably heard the usual thing  but really don't do it  you have so much to live for  it might be difficult now but really  it will get better  just hold in there and believe  you've already done held on this long  why not just hold on a little longer  I believe you can make it through this  I know you can     It seems clear that this issue is causing you a lot of pain   I agree that looking for someone in an LGBT organization to talk to might help   There are a lot of things to live for  whether you are straight  gay  cis or trans   Please don't let the fact that your parents do not yet understand stop you from living  I would invite you over for a hot meal  if I could  We could cook together  If you could have ANY meal you wanted  what would it be    And honestly  after spending NYE and NYD in bed for 24  hours I get it  I couldn't even bring myself to use the bathroom  Something about that goddamned holiday  I don't know  2016 was shit and there is no way I can get my hopes up for 2017  if it is just going to be another shit sandwich like this last year  And then I started my period        Man  a lot of people care about you  I promise  You know I do and and here to listen any time you need  Things will get better  I promise  The world needs more people like you  Please reach out and talk to us  Please   I am glad you are fine for the moment  If you are on medicine  is there a way to help it work better  A change of prescription or something  All I can hope is that you change your mind  and I hope that letting it out helped   Yes  it is all right to want attention  to want to be loved  to want to feel   Do reach out  in person if possible  or post here as the other person suggests  That's a shame  Not your fault  though  You're fine for thinking that way  Ah    whoops  Thank you very much for your advice  I'll absolutely look into this some more and then give it a try  Really  honestly appreciated so much  Thank you There must be a reason you have low self esteem   The fact that you get rejected by girls does not mean that you will never find one who likes you   Do you think you're trying too hard or looking for the wrong kind of girl  First of all your not hopeless your a human being everyone has their imperfections their negatives and their positives but no one on this earth is perfect  So to maybe combat these feeling why don't you join a class you enjoy or a sport you enjoy and if you want to lose weight start small and have realistic goals  I don't know if this helped but I really hope it did  3 I am sorry you are ill  Have you had any luck with whatever doctor you go to  Any chance they will come up with an answer for you  I don't know what the right answer is  but I don't think that suicide is it  I am not sure  but I don't think the insurance would pay out in that case anyway  Please take care   Preferably not  I'm ironically not a fan of permanent marks on my body  and as such not really a tattoo person  Thank you for the continued advice  I've given it a look  Cheers     I hope you'll be fine for a long time   Is there someone you can talk to about your problems  You're in a tough spot   I hope they can get to the bottom of this illness  to begin with  I just feel as if almost every person that attempted to help a suicidal person that eventually ended their lives feel guilt to some extent  At first  I thought that it was my fault and that I could've done something better to prevent it  but soon started to realize that I can't go on in life having something I can't change burden me and make me even more sad  People who are drunk make choices they might not make when they are sober  You know that  You realize that you have depression  and it is something you need help with  I would suggest that you find a counselor to talk to  Someone who can help you find whatever you need to help you  Please take care   It does pay out with suicide  I verified this  it's a group plan through work   I've been batting back and forth between my gynecologist and gastroenterologist because it's lower pelvic pain and they can't decide which it is   Now they are saying urologist     Every week I start by telling myself this week will be different but it always seems by the end of the week I am exhausted again   What would it take to make you want to live  What kind of life do you wish you had right now  Cunt Everyone in the Radiohead discord cares a lot about you and wants to help you  Today you talked about how amazing it was listening to Daydreaming for the first time with the chat  and I promise you there will be many many more great moments like that in your life  Please hold on  This has happened to me before on this subreddit  Although    I didn't feel "remorse" for it  My mindset was moreof  "I tried my best  but it wasn't enough  I can't let this be a burden to me when I try to help others "  You know  it's more like you're learning from a mistake  You just gotta learn the lesson and build off it  I have pain in my lower pelvis   They have ruled out Crohns  Colitis  Diverticulitis  an infection  PCOS  uterine fibroids  ovarian cysts  and now I have to see a urologist   You are who you are  We are all shaped by the past  but it does not have to be all we are  I don't know what happened to you  but it obviously hurt you a lot  I am sorry for that  I can't  and won't try to make your choices for you but I will argue that living is the only way to make progress  Things that are over never improve   Shit  anything hot I don't really have any cravings for anything specifically  Just a long list of what i DON'T WANT  Lol   The longest i've spent by myself with no human interaction was 8 months  It sucks  I hope one day I can get out of this shithole   I'm about to start my period ugh  Due tomorrow actually  probably why I was more emotional than usual when I wrote the post  I'm usually pretty numb  I've had this throw away account made for over a year for when I feel suicidal  Pathetic   That's a proactive way of thinking about it  Thanks  Well  I've not been doing so great still  but I'm very appreciative and pleased to find all these replies after so long  That does help very much  I will look into the foundation some more because I can't afford the more expensive stuff right now  Newbie question  do you know how much this kind of thing  or somebody else suggested a concealer   will rub off on my jeans   shorts etc   Thank you again    I've been talking with people for years  with professionals with really good people  and I've failed them and myself too many times to keep trying  I talk and they listen but I don't know if I really do I didn't know for sure  but I thought it would be terrible if you went and did that and it turned out to be futile  It is amazing of you to be thinking of your husband when it is so hard for you  Someone like you shouldn't be taken too soon  All I can do is wish you the best   I agree   I feel responsible for what has happened and need to make it right  How have you failed them or yourself  I don't understand   At least they are still looking   Good luck   I really hope you get a diagnosis  Thanks  Well  I was kinda aware of the fact that my parents will find out one day     I'll contact my school psychologist when the winter break is over  At least my mother will be informed first  my parents are divorced so they had to decide who's going to get informed first if something happens    One week  or two  left and then my life situation will change    I can't believe I'm going to do this  I'll set myself a DUE date  so I don't procrastinate it until it's too late  Two weeks from now on  In this time I have to contact my school psychologist   How are you responsible for an illness  It isn't like you asked the universe to do this to you  From what I can see  you have had an unusual problem arrive and are doing your best to find an answer  What more can one ask  Don't take nobility to an extreme here  just concentrate on getting better   I think I know what you need to do  find another happiness    Sit down and write out a list of everything that makes you smile to think of  puppies  YouTube makeup videos  a plate full of french fries  your favorite skirt  Then see which of those you can pursue as a hobby  as something you do purely for yourself alone  Maybe you volunteer at the local dog shelter once a week  Maybe you commit to learning how to create new makeup looks or take up painting  Do you enjoy cooking  Maybe you start experimenting with different recipes  Maybe you learn to sew or embroider or knit   Pick something you think you could enjoy  and try to expand on it  Create your own source of happiness  Find what makes you feel good to do  and do it   I believe that everyone has a purpose  but you have to go after it  You need to actively work to discern what it is and how you can achieve it  You have to go after what calls to you  what speaks to your soul   If you're not sure where to start  I'm sure we can all help provide ideas if you tell us a little bit about what interests or appeals to you  I wonder  too  I worry there's something I'm missing that I could do  But it's been almost two decades now  If there were a way  I would have found it by now  I made really shitty money decisions over the last year or so mainly because he has been unemployed underemployed for most of the time we've been together and I had to figure it out day by day   I'm out of choices   Anything that would normally be an option for someone in my situation  like taking out a loan  aren't options because of my lack of planning  We are  but it's hard dealing with multiple doctors who may or may not have access to each other's notes  Nah  I get it  Like I said  I felt that way the other day before my period  Women get crazy with the hormones  I obsessed over suicide planning for  hours  and came to the internet to boo hoo to anyone who would listen    I think it is human nature to cry for help at times and feel comforted that people are out there who might care  Or  on the flip side  to validate our ridiculous internal narrative that no one really understands so we should end it anyway  Humans are just social creatures     Though  damn lady  I'm sorry you have been so isolated  That sucks so hard  I wish there were something I could do to help      This is the first time here or anywhere   Your wife sounds exactly like mine   If you google "narcissist wife" believe me  she will fit everything to a tee   You're also being abused by her  and she would deny it   People like this don't want to believe they're abusive  but they have to know it because they're smart enough to drive you over the edge to control you   My advise is to find a lawyer for your kids sake   Be patient until you plan everything  and set up a wall that will keep you safe from her crushing retaliation   Your kids need you because she is so irrational that it has to be affecting them   There is no way around someone like that   She controls by being nice until your defenses are down  then comes the barrage of criticism including you being less of a man   In my case  it's too late   I'm planning on taking my life because I am afraid of what she is capable of   She sits and comes up with the most irrational thoughts and accusations and if i don't succumb  the fight is on   If I take control by being calm and refusing to be bothered by her tirades  she completely looses it  and of course puts it on me   When I tell her she's being abusive she ignores it or says we both are   I am not   I think you have hope because of a promise of a better job and opportunity to get out   You have to devise a plan to get your kids  and prevent her from ever harming you   That will take some planing  but you're probably smarter than her  but you cannot let her wreck your life    Usually choices made in a hurry wind up being the old best I could do at the time variety  There isn't anyone in your life that can help somehow  Even a gofundme request for aid  In some areas people will have a fundraiser for someone with big trouble  like an illness or a fire  Is that a possibility for you   Them Well  you can't just lie down and die  here  Literally  you need to actively go out into the world to kill yourself  Why not reroute that energy into actively trying to find what will help you stay alive   You WANT to live  So live  You are your own best help here  Listen to yourself  In the end  it is you who goes to decide  If nobody will give you help  go and take it yourself  If you can't find a psychologist  then find an online support group  find a group therapy meet up to attend  etc    There are options  It sounds to me like you just don't want to fight for life  But you can't do nothing  you'd have to fight for death  too  Why would you make yourself do something you don't even want  in the end  You have two paths here  Pick the one you want to take   And for god sakes don't throw yourself in front of a train  You seem smart enough  I think you know that would be a remarkably short sighted thing to do  that likely would not result in death  but just make everything much worse   Thanks for letting us know   For those who have been there  it must be tough to revisit dark times   Sharing the news that you have come back to a place of joy uplifts all of us  How's your support system  The thoughts that you are having are a rough thing to go through alone  Sorry to hear about your situation  Other people do know what it's like  I've been through loosing a spouse  Try to remember they would not want you to feel this way  If it was your fianc who lost you  I'm sure you would reassure them and tell them to keep going  It will not be easy but you can survive this  And you never have to stop loving the one you lost  As long as you live  a very special part of them  a part they shared only with you  also lives on   It seems as if you're very angry  Could you try taking some deep breaths  and would you like to talk  I pay 80 a visit  2 visits a month for BCT  I tried EMDR with same therapist  but it was really wearing me thin  Well  I do  I advocate for lying to a shrink  If you cannot get help because you are vocalizing a plan for suicide  stop vocalizing it  Tell them you feel suicidal  but do not give details  The goal here is to get help because after all you don't  actually  want to kill yourself  Suicide is just your last resort  the absolute desperate act  So rather than rush into the room saying "I'm going to jump in front of a train on X day  and I hope you all go to hell " instead rephrase by focusing on your intention in being there in front of the psychologist  in asking for help  "I feel like I want to die  and I don't want to feel this way anymore  I feel angry  and I feel like nobody wants to help me get better  and I want to get better "  This is depression 101  Anyone who has experienced multiple episodes can tell you that this is the key to getting help without landing yourself in the psychiatric ward  or  in the OP's case  getting doctors to refuse to provide treatment   Still not clear on how that works in the UK  seems like a human rights violation to me to refuse someone medical treatment when they need it and I'm guessing there are details we are not privy to here   Can you tell me why you feel this way  Here's an idea  Can you put the designated dosage in some ziploc bags  and only keep one bag in your nightstand or another piece of furniture  and put the rest away  Lock it someplace  like in a safe  Never have the full bottle near you  Can you do that  Also  I'm here if you'd like to talk  My name's Abby  Can you try reading through these talking tips  https   www reddit com r SWResources comments igh87 concerned but dont know what to say here are some  st IXGXAN6V sh 702b593d I am not going to tell you to be strong  and I have no right to tell you to be anything  All I can really do is offer you a friendly ear and some support  I thought cyber bullying was against the law almost everywhere by now  and anyone who does it can be arrested  Molesters are the lowest of the low  and should be imprisoned forever  I am very sorry for what you have had to go through  I don't know how to help  I wish I did  All I can really say is that dying because of them would be terrible  and I wish you wouldn't   I'm not angry  I haven't felt that emotion in years  I just decided to post something here just for the sake of it  Kinda helps Idunno  Kinda sad atm but I'm gonna sleep soon    Kinda feels absurdly forced    has this taste of 'i'm doing this so i can get paid  if you could hung up faster that would be great  sir'  The best advice I can give is to read the stuff in the sidebar  There is a lot of valuable information there  The talking tips are a goldmine   Don't kill yourself  you have to much to live for  so fuck everyone who did you wrong and give them the finger  Just do as I ask and keep living because there is people out there that love you  It depends on the type and quality of the concealer  but most good ones won't I know you've suffered alot these past few months  I've witnessed your ups and downs  I'm fortunate enough not to know first hand what it takes for a person to be brought to the verge of suicide but looking at this note right now is horrific and painful  I'm not gonna lie those circumstances you mentioned are bleak as hell  Still  I can't help but feel like there's a better future out there for you man cause you're a really dope person with a big heart  which is rare af   Not to mention you're young  Personally  your life is worth existing  Obviously others feel the same way  You know I'm down to talk my friend  Love you bro  3 A couple of thoughts for you  First  people who are in pain tend to be self centered  They are dealing with their own problem which cuts down on the empathy for others  But you know that  But it doesn't make you an awful person  Second  the grief over losing someone isn't always temporary  Some  of it lasts a lot longer than you might think  I can't make your choices for you  but I encourage you to find a professional to help you make them wisely   The most important things are to let her know that you and her support network are there for her no matter what happens  and to be able to listen actively  to help understand why she feels like that  what you can do to help  and what's changed recently    The community info section on this subredit had some good advice and great sources  along with charities like Samaritan's   Perhaps tell her about this subredit or some lifelines or reinforce how helpful being able to talk and vent with full anonymousity is  Be careful not to  force  her to do anything  just suggest a range of places that can help   Without more information from her perspective I can't offer any more help  but I hope you succeed  That's reassuring to hear  thank you very much again     Hey  this is a really tough thing to go through  I get how you're feeling because I've lost friends to suicide too  This is going to be a very difficult part of your life  and I find that being with others who understand the pain I'm feeling helps me cope  If you feel the same way  could you check out r suicidebereavement  They understand how you're feeling because they feel the same way  darling  Thank you very much for your reply  sorry I didn't see and respond any sooner    It's awful that you went through that  but weirdly reassuring to know that I'm not alone  and I thank you for sharing your story with me  I've been actively seeking therapy for awhile and slowly  clumsily trying to build myself back up  I've never wanted a tattoo on myself  so I will hope that in that time it will fade enough that it is not immediately noticeable some day  I've seen 3 different general practitioners  2 psychiatrists  2 research assistants  and 3 different counselors  I've been on every type of anti depressant there is  I've even had rTMS treatment  so experimental that it isn't even covered by my province's insurance plan   that's how out of ideas these practitioners have been  The last resort is ECT  but I can't take ECT and keep my job right now  So it's either  maybe  cure myself but have no money  basically become homeless  and risk losing some or all of my memories   or suffer through existence until I can take the two weeks off  and then do all of the above except homelessness  I can't bare the thought of either  so I'm making this decision now while I still have a semblance of joy in my life to help me through the actual act of dying  This is great advice  and I do value internet friends just as much as girl friends  if not more since many are non judgmental   Thank you a lot  I don't know I can get a therapist  I would feel guilty asking my parents since we are pressed for money  and I don't have job  I'm 17 btw   I do have a problem with serious connection and initiation  but I just feel like nobody would take me seriously  I've lived in a small southern town my whole life  and people have held on to all of my embarrassments and failures  People tease me a lot  I just don't know how to get confidence back  I have never made an internet friend  but that sounds nice  I'm not a gamer or anything  so I don't know how I can find others like me  But thank you for your kind words Awful  I'm pretty sure it's nothing I can control  My life is not terrible  I'm just suffering from clinical depression   It sounds like you know far more about the system than I do  I  can't say that I know the right answer  It's your head  and your choices  All I can do is offer a bit of support and a friendly ear   Not in any way are you a slut  You were raped  and the fact that you had to go through that is honestly terrible  You're not gross  either  Report it to the police  and go find some sorta counselling for it  Feelings from this can build over time  and it's best to get any lingering psychological stuff dealt with as soon as possible   Its alright  metric can be confusing for those not used to it    Disorders of chronobiology aren't so common       Why do you think it's  DSPS  https   www sleepassociation org patients general public delayed sleep phase syndrome   instead of  non 24  http   www non 24 com about non 24 php    They have similarities  but they're different   There are  imperfect  treatments for both  but the treatments are different  Well done  If you find yourself chickening out  for lack of a better word   I find being impulsive about it really helps and as soon as I start thinking about contacting someone I go and do it before I can chicken out again  If you ever want to talk feel free to PM    What do BCT and EMDR mean  Would a hotline turn you into the police  Could you read through these talking tips  https   www reddit com r SWResources comments igh87 concerned but dont know what to say here are some  st IXGXAN6V sh 702b593d cyber bullying is agaisnt the law but the only thing the police did is told them to stop and to leave me alone thats all     and about when i was molestated i told my mum an she didnt care   this happened ages ago but even tho i told my mum the man stayed in my life for years bec he used to be my step dad   he is gone now but i cant forget about it      It was rape  on multiple counts  no question at all  They took advantage of you  they are disgusting people who need to be locked up   Please go to the police  the fact that you are a so young makes it very serious  They could  and would  do it again  Put a end to these maniacs behavior before they hurt more people like you  I decided to start exercising  will check out my local gym  and to continue going to choir which I recently joined  Today was not so good  I'm back to feeling like this might be my last year  But maybe not  Thanks for checking in again  means a lot   It turns out  in my experience  a lot of people are horrible and think they can do whatever they want without any repercussions  What these guys did was next level criminally psychopathic horrible  Don't listen to the nasty things these people say  they lack empathy and will say and do whatever they want  They may try to lie in court but it doesn't matter  You are 15 and they are adults  even in states where the age of consent is under 18 they are still liable for felony corruption of a minor on top of straight up violent rape  If there were bystanders there  they are also liable  Sorry you were tricked by these psychos  they're good at that  it's not your fault  Go to the police and get some justice for you and all their potential victims  Thanks for writing  It is good to read  "success stories" on here  Behavioral cognitive therapy and Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing  Greatest comeback ever and you get to write it  Hang in there    Hey there  Im really sorry to hear you're going through this  I can  see that you are vehemently trying to discard how you are feeling due to your age  Please do not belittle yourself  Suicide of a close one is a fucking tough one for anyone to experience despite your age okay  It leaves so many unanswered questions and just generally shocks the fuck out of you to imagine that someone so close to you was feeling that way  Remember not to blame yourself  and remember that your dear friend would have wanted the best for you  Get better for her   I was 13 when I lost a friend to suicide too  We were just both little girls  I fucking loved her  was way too young to understand what happened and It really fucked me up bad  I became depressed and horribly anti social  but what helped me was me going to therapy  despite being too shy to talk properly for ages   I went for the past three years  stopped in may   and I am 19 right now  I still occasionally have to fight with sorrow  and easily I start to loop destructive thoughts around it  What was a significant thing that my therapist told me that it is important to remember that  Therapy is not about forgetting about her  but to help you constructively deal with sorrow and help yourself still grow as a person   You mentioned that you have no trouble with money  so I think this is something you could try out   This is a difficult situation  and you have to let yourself feel and process through emotions  Feel free to PM me  if you'd like to talk  Just as no one chooses to be gay  or attracted to red heads  no one makes a conscious choice to be attracted to CP  It is out of your control  and almost entirely to do with the dopamine hit  After watching a lot of porn you get desentisised to it  and you get attracted to something more unique to get your dopamine hit    From your previous post I know that you have repeatedly tried to quit "cold turkey" this is almost impossible to do with any addiction  let alone one with such a high as porn  The fact that it is unique  dangerous and illegal will only have increased this hit that you get  I'm impressed that you managed to hold out for 10 days  especially considering how hard the withdrawal symptoms seem to have hit you after  Do you want to elaborate on what methods you used to do so    As far as I am aware  every success story for people quiting CP involved significant professional help  Dealing with both the withdrawal  the understanding of what you've done  and the stigma are all significant problems and dealing with them together will be challenging  I know your said that where you live it is illegal  but have you considered the possibility of health tourism  moving to a country where it is legal for a short period  Are there any countries locally that it is legal  and have you looked into it  Otherwise many psychiatrists will do Skype sessions now  allowing you to see a professional in this field    You are aware that what you are watching is terrible  and you have tried quitting before  so with professional help I am sure you will be able to make a full recovery  although this may take a significant amount of sacrifice  You may have to give up access to all media except at work or a basic non smart phone  or greater sacrifices  but it will be worth it    Other things to help may be switching to drawn porn  to reduce the impact on actual children  although this will require significant effort  as you are aware  as the dopamine hit will be much less    While cutting contact with the forums and sources that you are on is the main priority  and is essential  you can also help while you do so and relapse by contacting your governments CP police investigation anonymously and report everything you find once you visit  Often the more visual data they collect the more they can help the children in the situation  It will not help you cut this addiction  but will be saving them a lot of suffering while you try and do so  Only do this with full anonymousity and not for any forums your on  even with TOR you risk the possibility of being doxxed  either by the police or by the providers    I wish you good luck with getting rid of this addiction  but I would like to say that if you   ever   feel like you will actively hurt someone in person  go to the police  10  years suffering in jail is still far far better than the lifetime of suffering that you would cause   I have never been attracted to CP  and am horrified by it and the impacts it has  but I had my own addictions  I can atleast listen if you want to talk     I think that's the worst part    I know it could be worse    I don't want to be here if it gets worse    I wish I thought I could be helped   and until I think I can  I can't be helped Hmm maybe go back to school take some classes and try to get a better job I've been cut free for a little over a month due to a medicine that reduces the urges to self harm  I miss it a lot  I crave it  But the medicine has been doing its job and hopefully one day I can go off of it and not feel the urge  Hell  before October  I hadn't self harmed in 9 years    go back to get an MBA   Maybe   Probably not   I don't have the money to and I'm already 25k in student debt with roughly 1200 in interest a year You were raped  There is absolutely no question about it  What they did was wrong on many levels  You should go to the police right away  because this is serious and the culprits need to be locked up   Send those fuckers to jail  they do not deserve freedom   Also    you did nothing wrong    just know that  because it wasn't your fault This is how I feel too  Im trying to work on myself but if I don't get better    I dunno How are u doing OP   That number   keep thinking about it  It took a lot of work to get there and it sounds like you don't want to lose it  Maybe write it down somewhere to remind yourself    I'm 2 years clean myself  I can't speak for everyone  but I think it does get better over time  It never goes away though  Even now I still see a knife and think about how it felt  what it would feel like to relapse  I'm in a place where I don't  need it though  Finding other outlets for the reasons i was doing it helped to keep it manageable  Stay strong  Don't give in   At home  Kinda not good honestly   I guess I'm different than most  I never "got used to the pain"  It was is a big part of it for me  not a nuisance on the side  I viewed myself as some horrible person that deserved to suffer  so I'd actually do stuff to try to make it hurt more   I don't even cut that bad and that thread is still hard to read All I hope is that you find the peace you deserve  Go to the police or the hospital  a counselor  anywhere  This is not your fault at all  They are just saying those things to make you feel bad about yourself so you won't say a word to anyone  Please do not take their words to heart   Hugs I have learned life is like thst man  Great blissful times coupled with misery  I was suicidal at your age  then went on to have many different blissful times of my life lasting years but then got suicidal after a terrible breakup agsin last year  I'm learning nobody stays happy all the time  No promises in life but odds are you will live life agsin and hate life agsin  Being human is bullshit  Take revenge on the people that wronged you I know it's painful  I was so lonely for so much of my life  I'll pray your heart feels calm and at ease   There is a quote that says "You meet a lot of temporary people between 15 25" and I have found this true  You need to find things that you like about yourself and focus on that   Being dependent on someone else leads to a lot of let downs  Co dependency can have severe consequences including abuse      My advice is engage in social events at school  Find your voice again  Age difference alone answers the question   They know what they did  Report    Don't hesitate   Go to the hospital  they know what to do  I'm too embarrassed to do that   I am probably going to have to ask my parents for help   I don't think I could handle having everyone know though  Please please dont   So let it be that this birth never occurred   But it  did   That's an unchangeable fact  I'm celebrating your life today  even if you aren't  You are valuable   Why do you feel that your life ends here   You deserve so many more years to experience life  In the grand scheme  we only get a few  You deserve a full term   I know that doesn't mean it will be all happiness  I haven't found a way to make it that way  either  There is hate and despair  too  Sometimes  I think  that is part of the beauty   You are a beautiful soul  I hope that you choose to continue your life  There are many that would love for you to be a part of their life  and to know your story  and to learn from you   Is there anything else that you would like to share   I hope that you're still here  Thank you for writing these words  Please talk to the police  I know it's scary but you can't let them get away with rape  That's what it is  If you try to brush this under the rug you let them win  and it won't go away until you get help    My ex dealt with a similar thing and tried to brush it off  It really messed with her for a long time  and by the time she wanted to report it  it was way too late   It is not your fault  not even 1  your fault  I understand it's easy to feel ashamed and blame yourself but it's all their fault  Please tell the police ASAP  They never will understand  They will spend the rest of their lives thinking of what they could have done to help you  the guilt that they didn't do enough eating and eating them up inside until they too feel hollow and empty  Yet who will be left for them to text  To talk to  Their best friend already gone   Pills are a painful and horrible way to go  I don't know what factors led to you being in this state  ready to leave  but I'm happy to listen    Please get professional attention immediately  Call either 116 123  UK   1 800 273 8255  US  or whatever your local number is of you live anywhere else in the world  Give the relevant number to your friend too  Is this a response  What ya need buddy  No one deserves pain and suffering  let alone death  I know life is hard  horribly so  but you have done a fantastic job of surviving this long already  I'm not going to guilt trip you into staying  but do you want to talk about your experiences  I'm happy to listen if you need to vent    You seem to be putting a lot of blame on yourself  which as I'm sure your aware is pretty unhealthy  What have you done that makes you perceive yourself as such a terrible person  Well  first off Hi   After that  look man don't kill yourself  I know everything right now feels like garbage mixed in sadness  but offing yourself so young is just a tragic thing  Look at it this way your ex isn't really worth it in the first place for how she's treated you and due to your religious convictions I see why being called gay is insulting to you  but do you really want to sulk for someone who disrespected you like that  No  She ain't worth jack  As for your sister you can't control people's action  Would be interesting right   it's nothing to be embarrassed about you didn't sleep with them  Maybe try finding a new city to live if possible  Have a fresh start  I mean you pulled yourself out of that sadness before you can do it again just have a you day where you treat yourself and realize you're worth it and as for God  I don't think he's abandoned you and I don't think you believe that seeing as youre looking for help which is good  TL Dr  You've pulled yourself out of your funk before you can do it again  Treat yourself and learn that sometimes things aren't in control  Let go and let God  do the things that fulfill you   Hope that helped and didn't make it worse Can you explain the frustration and anger   Why do you feel that way  Not really Thank you  but sadly  the closest clinic on that site is 30 miles away   I feel numb right now  Nothing feels real  My family feels like strangers to me  They can't help  No one can  Not even me  I hate myself  I'm tired of feeling this way  I don't know why I do  I'm an ungrateful bitch  It sickens me  There's no hope  Life is meaningless  I'm tired of this horrible cycle  Anyone else experiencing this would want to kill themselves  too  It doesn't feel right to live anymore if it's going to be like this  It doesn't make sense  Good luck  Hope you feel better soon  For some people they do  Why not talk to a psychiatrist and or therapist  I like to think of my meds as replacing the thing in my brain that my body doesnt create on it's own like it does for others  Antidepressants can be different for everyone and they can work differently too  There are many factors to them  but mine have helped immensely  Hey there  uphill battles can suck  I'm here if you want someone to talk to  It's always easier to climb with someone else    Yea Playing guitar is kind of my distraction but I need to get better at it so I can get more satisfaction from it  maintain friend    Hey  so you're in college right  Have you considered maybe joining a sport or club that seems like an interest to you  Having a boyfriend is fun but don't forget you have your own life too  if you become codependent  you can lead to him having a dangerous power over you and we know das no bueno  You got this girl  or boy   one step at a time  Start small like the previous commenter said have a list of things you like  I just really need somebody to talk to  I don't care what we talk about  but I just feel really lonely right now  I'm happy to listen  although I would still recommend using the suicide hotline in your country  It's still anonymous  probably free  and they receive a lot of training  as well as experience    And while I know it's hard  it sounds like you need to improve your support network a bit  I'm sure your friends have their own problems  but you   need   people who support you through everything  I think it's good that you can identify this  Try to surround yourself with things that you love and you know make you happy  Talk to your psychiatrist about way to combat the thoughts and managing your spare time  I feel like for me  down time is when my thoughts go astray  maybe try to keep yourself busy  All the best to you in this difficult time  and feel free to PM me if you need  Hey there  I'm up to talk if you want  Story of my life hahah  no You play any games or shit  thank you so much   unfortunately my psychiatrist won't do therapy so i'm not allowed to ask advice  only tell him symptoms     but thank you   yes  evening time when im alone in my room is when it all gets iffy  You can talk to me  What are you feeling  So  I think you might be having a funk right now  it happens  you seem to be a bit bummed because of the ladies but when you say they reject you even when you're trying to be friends  what do you mean  Like you try to say hi and they're like "Go away Human"   Tell me what's up  We're here for you  There's heaps of free  online counselling services that im sure could provide you with some advice that you're looking for  But yeah I definitely think you should be proud of yourself for acknowledging hard times and being able to work them out  It's a very admirable trait c  I'm not going to help you end it all  but I would be more than happy to listen to your story  you sound like you need to vent    I would still recommend your country's suicide hotline first  they get a lot of training and will likely help more   Any advice on coping strategies  I usually completely shut down and lie really still so I don't impulsively get something to hurt myself with  But that's not exactly healthy either   I don't think no one gives a shit about you  Maybe it's wrong place  wrong time  I wouldn't have messaged if I didn't care  Yeah  Mostly star wars battlefront  rock band  and rocksmith  glad to hear that  I am not 100  if to try them or not  Might be I can handle this without them  I'll see Those are good things to do   Exercising as I'm sure you've heard can really help with depression and with both you'll hopefully meet some new people  Sorry today wasn't good  hopefully tomorrow can bring better days  I'm here if you ever need to talk  Did you ever play the og battlefront or are you too young for that  what do mean you wonder if it's true  which part  I'm actually the vice president of a club at my university  I think my depression is very high functioning  But I'm just going through the motions  This might be strange but have u tried getting a pet  A cat's purr when you're feeling down is so comforting  To look at that face and realize that something so cute and soft is real and alive  Otherwise I hope you know that many people are in your situation and if you decide to end it  you'll never know what couldve helped you  You'll never know what 2030 looks like  or whether trump will last another term  You might meet someone who changes your life  You might get involved in a volunteering position and make a difference  Someone  somewhere  is lying in bed feeling the same way as you   young  alone  hopeless  desperately crying out for help  What would you say to them   Hey   Please call the hotline  There's one for every country  I know it sounds dumb but having someone random to talk to might help  Don't give up yet  I know how hard it is  trust me  but you have to keep trying  Think about anything positive you can   Maybe it is fulfillment  but I know that if someone had an open ear to me when I was at my lowest it would have helped me a lot  I might be an internet stranger but sometimes strangers are the easiest to talk to  No bias  no judgement  no bullshit  I take your point  however if things are that bad and he requires treatment then maybe it's best to be honest  even if it's going to land him in some place as horrifying as the county mental ward  Well  your an anonymous stranger to me  so I can't really use you  and I've been where you are now  so I probably won't toy with you  PM me if you want to talk  but I won't force you to   I hope it gets better and I still recommend you talk to a professional  and definitely get psychiatric help if you haven't already   Well I was on them for like half a year and I stopped for a few weeks and in those weeks I was without them  I noticeably became more depressed compared to my bouts when I'm on Prozac  Afterwards  I went on them again and waited a few weeks  and i became less sad  Not 100  happy but just less sad in comparison when I wasn't on it   Sure  we all know that  But the show is tiring  and this dude is clearly tired of it  Suggesting someone insert tab A into slot B and present with a cardboard cutout might result in a valid treatment option for the cardboard cutout but the dude is still going to be hurting  There isn't anything positive anymore  I got hit by a truck on my motorcycle  that was my baby  I just got it on the road again today but I'm too far gone to enjoy it anymore  I might as well at least try  There's nothing here for me   I'm glad you have somewhere to stay and feel a little better   I had a good New Years  nothing special but it was ok  And hey if you don't mind me asking  what grade are you in  I'm in grade 10  I seen that you were thinking of dropping out  but if we are in the same grade  I could help you out with school if you ever need help  Thanks  I hope you do too  I mean that  Can't believe you feel the same way as me  Saddens me   Sorry to hear that    reminds me of a quote  "Do not confuse my bad days as a sign of weakness  Those are the days when I am fighting my hardest "  Fight on  OP  We are all soldiers against this invisible darkness    Want to tell me how you're feeling   Are you still with us  It doesn't matter that people have "worse" problems than yours  Honestly your own problem is pretty big  so don't be ashamed  I have a friend that her own sister has tried to take her own life multiple times  as for my friend I don't know if she has attempted but it sure gets to her a lot  she is very depressed even though she is one of the most cheerful persons i know  I know she hides it because I do to  I don't claim to be suicidal or anything I am very happy with my life  my parents are separated but both love me and support me  I also have a lot of friends  But it seems to me that I am broken inside  because no matter the good that comes to my way or my own achievements don't really make me happy  I'm literally depressed over nothing but it's still a problem for me  so please don't downplay your own problems  Still  please don't kill yourself things can turn around when you least expect it so please at least wait till you're 16 18 21 whatever the age in your country is when you can make your own legal decisions or whatever and maybe turn you life around and find happiness  You still got family and friends that care for you  so please don't commit suicide  I'm also 15 btw  PM me if you want a little chat or if I could be of any help  I'm from America so if I don't answer right away is because I'm sleeping  Take care  Thank you for sharing  No 1 you were raped No 2 you are not a slut No 3 those guys are totally fucking retarded  Now if I could give you a little advise  I may sound like an asshole here  maybe because I am  but I suggest to be careful which friends you make  this isn't victim blaming  it's obvious that you are the victim and that those guys deserve to go to jail  you really should stay away from fucking drunks and stoners especially if they are bigger than you   Life is incredibly shit  and especially while your growing up  Judgemental and ignorant peers  the narrow constrained life your forced and the stresses our society place on you are hard and demanding    But suicide is not a solution  it just transfers your emptiness and grief to your parents and friends  Depression is caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain  normally Serotonin  Anti depressants can help you "re adjust" to live a happy and successful life  however you are feeling right now  Speak to your country's headline for immediate help  then approach your GP or parents about getting onto CAMHS  or whatever child mental health equivalent you have in your country  They will try their best to help  and it's better than the alternative   You know who deserves pain and suffering  People who cause that themselves  Now I doubt you are a terrorist causing pain and suffering but if you are then go ahead and end your worthless life just don't take anyone with you  If you are some ordinary person then you don't deserve that  Please do not kill yourself  Maybe you will find someone just as broken as you and you will fall in love  Because I cam tell you are broken  I'm a little broken myself  but if you really are trying to end it    just try to start over  change town  start again  maybe even change country  go to a country where everything is cheaper where it is easier to start anew  Hey  I'm so sorry that you feel that way  especially at 11   No matter what you feel now  your perspective will change as you become an adult  I promise  Don't make life changing decisions at your age Well  I got it in tbe ER so I doubt I'm much of a help here   With all the supportive comments already posted  allow me a different kind of suggestion  One comment suggested leaving town  You have done that once apparently  Now let me suggest to you to grab a quick plane ticket and visit a different country  You are so young and have much to experience in this big world  There are really odd and different people and cultures out there that you may find extremely and peculiarly satisfying  Might as well go out and check out the foreign delights shall you not  Explore the night life  Check out the nature  Meet new people  Although you may feel as if you will not know what to do as you arrive there  the simple act of just going somewhere will take you to unprecedented locations and meeting amazing people  Don't think about it  just go  I know this because I felt the same way you do now  If you are really contemplating this decision  please consider my suggestion  because as for myself  it really helped me and open my eyes  You only do live once  might as well do something out of the ordinary right  Don't hesitate to PM me man  We got your back  Don't do it  It's not the solution and nobody  including yourself  benefits from it  I know its shit right now  and it seems like everything is terrible and will be forever  but that's just not the case  I'm sorry to hear of your relapse  I'm replying because you mean something to me   and this community Me too  Told myself if things didn't get better this year I'm out  I understand but I still hope you decide differently Sorry to hear  Anything specifically happen to set it off today  Please hang in there    Talk to him  But most importantly  listen  Listen to what he has to say  Thank you  just the sentiment itself helps Honestly  I think I'm good  The people I feel most at peace with are my roommates and we just got back from a lot of draining socializing  It's just nice to feel home  I'll make it through today   Report this to a police as soon as you can  You're not a slut because you were not in control of yourself when you were drunk  Hi  I applaud your willingness to help your friend  You and friend B might find the following page's info helpful as far as what to do to help friend A  http   suicidepreventionlifeline org help someone else       Good luck and peace be with you  I'm really sorry you've had to resort to cutting again  it's a horrible habit to kick  isn't it  I hope the conditions that caused you to take it up again disappear and you can go back to looking after your body  Feel free to PM me to talk about it if you want to    But first we'll look after the wound  No matter how bad you feel mentally  you can look after yourself physically  Infected cuts don't make  anything  better  so wash the cuts  and dress them  If you've used a kitchen or outdoor knife  clean the cuts with anti  bacterial wipes  If their deep  or close to arterys  call the emergency services   While cutting can seem like the only release from the pain  it doesn't help anything  So speak to your GP psychiatrist about adjusting your dose  communicate with your support network  Cutting mainly releases dopamine and adrenaline  If you feel up to it  try picking up one of your hobbies you've dropped  It can often have similar effects  and is far far less self destructive  I'm sure you agree    And you are definitely not a "smelly heap of garbage" or whatever toxic language you used to describe yourself  You are honestly a great person  you've already managed to stop cutting before  and kept it up for a whole 3 years  which I'm sure you agree is just fantastic  Your a stranger on the internet  and even I'M proud of you    There are a lot of better solutions out their than self harm  something you have already realised once before  Do your best to look after yourself and I hope you get better     He lives in another state and our schedules are somewhat complicated  I'm not sure when he will be online   How do we approach the topic with him  It has been a pleasure getting to know you over the course of nearly a year  and I want you to know that I believe in you  I believe in you to find the strength to carry on  You have a beautiful soul and I've enjoyed the conversations we've shared  Please know that there are people out in the world that love and care about you  I am  always  here for you  Please reconsider  We love you   Meagan  3 It's alright  Coincidentally  I'm also a high school student    How close are you with this friend  Saaaame  Depression is so weird  Like sometimes it's why I cut myself then other times it's why I don't   It's unfortunate that we are not alone in this  The sad truth is that many people feel this same way  Very sad  Maybe take community college courses to improve your resume and stuff   I did'nt help you but you don't know how happy I am tout hear that   OP I PM'd you  I went through something similar as you did  And I please ask you to message me back  We can talk  heck  if you're near by we can even meet up and have some coffee or grab a bite to eat  But don't terminate your chance at life just yet  You still have a lot to live for  I found that out myself and no one was there for me through it all  but I promised myself I would help anyone with the same or similar situation as mine  someone  anyone  Well my dad was a bit of a dick  He had tickets to a broadway show I like but I have an aa meeting at the same time  He tried to pressure me in to going  But since I am secretary of the meeting I don't really have much choice I have to be there  Was just sitting here thinking about it and he really showed no concern that I am taking sobriety seriously  Also funny choice of words  Hang in there  He considers me a close friend  You don't deserve to be treated like that  If he doesn't love you then what's the point in staying  Sure you love him but he doesn't give you the attention a woman wants  Break up with him and move on  It will be hard at first but it's for your own good  I wish you the best    deleted                     0 7509      What is this   https   pastebin com 64GuVi2F 08162  In a marriage  you need to share your thoughts and feelings with each other   I know you think you are trying to protect her but holding onto these thoughts and feelings is only going to fester and get worse   You need to have a talk with her   She needs to know the state of mind that you are in   You obviously love her because you don't want her to suffer   I would venture a guess that she loves you just as much and would want to know exactly how you are feeling   She is your support system and you need to share it with her   If you love your wife and you don't want her to suffer you need to share openly with her    Don't do it  '  even tho life sucks right now you shouldn't give up  Think positive  There are many new things for all of us out there  Join a dating app and chat online  Get to know girls and take them out as friends maybe someone out there will change your life  you never know   I was in a somewhat similar situation  I was in an LDR with a depressed person while I myself was depressed  While threats of suicide were never directly made  we both were cutting  though she did so more than I did  After a while of trying to make it work  it was obvious that I couldn't be with a depressed person when I had no way to physically be around them and comfort them   Even in a local relationship  I question if I'd be able to handle it appropriately   Being in this relationship pushed me much further into my own depression   While it's your call to make  I would consider taking a step back and thinking about how this has affected your mental health  With that in mind  if she's shared specific plans with you  I would take whatever steps you possibly can to get her immediate help  Otherwise  consider breaking it off for your own good  What she ultimately decides is not and will never be your fault  no matter how much it seems that way   After breaking off my LDR  I received a detailed a report of the self harm she claimed to have inflicted due to my actions  We actually stayed in contact for maybe 6 months after that  but then I stopped hearing from her  and haven't since  It seems like she may have actually been getting better  but there's no way to be sure  But I know that I did everything I could  and I was still able to be there for her as a friend afterward  It really sounds like your taking a lot of blame on your young shoulders  I know it's easy to say and harder to do  but give yourself a break   You're not a terrible human   you're just human   We all make mistakes  we all go down the wrong path from time to time   Even getting locked up can be something that you can recover from   That's not to dismiss your feelings   they're real   You have every right in the world to feel them   I just want to remind you that you're worthy of love  including worthy of love from you  Then just say  " Hey man  I've heard about your     problems  Why are you feeling this way " Or anything similar that can help the conversation  Love is the most beautiful thing we have on this planet  Go out  meet someone  or join a dating site  talk to girls  assuming you're a guy  get to know people to get your mind out of those negative thoughts  I know it's hard but trust me love can change your life completely when you share it with someone else's   Hi  thank you for sharing  That is definitely a lot to go through and I can only imagine how difficult it is and I just shake my head because I don't know how I'd manage either  So I understand wanting a permanent escape  But of course that's not an answer  I mean if you think your being homeless would ruin your daughter's life  your committing suicide would be much  much worse     I assume you have asked your therapist  support group about what steps you should take  so I wonder what advice you've gotten so far  Maybe there are some social services they might direct you to if that hasn't been asked about already  Or maybe you could try 211 on your phone or check out http   www 211 org   Please forgive me  I know I don't really have answers    But I don't think you need to be ashamed  You are going through and have been through much and have a disability to boot  You are doing the right thing in going to therapy  etc  and doing what you can to manage  It would be overwhelming for me  and many others too      So if you are being hard on yourself  please do not be  You just need assistance to help deal with everything on your plate right now  and I hope you are able to find it     Maybe too  it would be helpful to speak see with your daughter and whatever friends you can every so often  if not about your troubles  just to stay in contact with people whom you care about and vice verse  I know it might be more difficult given the circumstances  but probably even moreso now is it important to maintain your social ties  even if it's a little a day week whatever  where maybe you could just take time off from your troubles and listen to how they are doing or whatever  and maybe by doing that they will want to reciprocate and give you an opportunity to bring your situation up if you want and maybe that would be another form of support    But the agenda primarily is to just stay in contact and know that you have that and can give you a break just to enjoy the people in your life and they can enjoy you  because maybe it'd be nice not just for you but for them to hear from you too  you know     But yeah  you seem to be doing what you can  you're not just mooching or whatever  so there is no shame in that  You're swimming  but the current just isn't going your way right now  Doesn't matter how old you are   anyone would be having difficulty given the circumastances  and I am sure you are not the only one out there in similar circumstances  likely others at more advanced age than you even     But it's never too old to hope  to seek help  to look for a way  So please do not give up on yourself and be unkind to yourself in any way  You and your life will always   always  be valuable     I hope things turn around for the better for you and that you find peace  May all be well in the end  if it's not well now  it's not the end     God bless you  friend  Please feel free to stay in contact to let me know how it's going and everything    Thank you     It sounds like you've just been completely overwhelmed with grief  I'm so sorry for your loss  Talk to someone  I was your age when I became depressed  Don't let it get out of control  Your mom would love to listen about how you feel  So would I   I can't  guarantee anything  but what if things do get better  You have survived this far  conditions that little of us in the discord will understand  but at the end of day we care about you and we don't want you to end your life  We might not be as close  but that doesn't mean I wouldn't care if you were gone  It would honestly destroy all of us in the chat  voicechat wouldn't be the same without you   please don't do anything reckless  if you need to talk to anyone  I'm a pm away for you too      Despot hey  look  i know things seem bleak but youre 15  3 more years of suffering and you get to live your own life  make your own decisions  and write your own story  in the meantime do what you  have to do to stay sane and for the love of god get rid of that gun  as long as youre alive there is still a chance  there is still hope that things can change  hang in there  pm me if you need to talk more If you're still here  just know that people care and it's bound to get better  please don't do this   T   4   K I've been there and still deal with that from time to time it sucks  I know and I'm sorry you're going through that right now  You're not an ungrateful bitch Im sure of that  it's that visceral hatred of yourself that gets into your mind  This state of mind isn't a permanent although it feels like it I wish there was some way to tell or show you but all I can tell you is that it passes  That's awesome  Congratulations  Keep going one day at a time   im so so so sorry you had to experience such a horrible trauma  i know what that's like  when it happened to me i told no one  i thought i could deal with it  10 years later its come back to haunt me and im finally getting help  dont wait that long  get the help you need and deserve  if you have to make something up like an eating disorder to get into therapy and then you have a chance to talk about it  i know it sounds fucked up but there is less stigma against that  its a sad world but it gets better  give it a chance for things to get better and change  you are not an attention whore  you need help  you need someone to talk to  you dont have to suffer alone   Also along with that  have you tried talking to your parents that you feel isolated from them  or do they brush it off  i love you Have you considered the university's therapy program if they have one  Or have you tried seeking a therapist  They can be very helpful Hey please don't I'm here to talk  Please hold on  If they're taking to long maybe try kids help phone  Idk it's in the USA or for people older than 19 but if you're younger call them and they can help  thanks  I am in the US and over 19  Dont think this could help  I tried calling the US number but I waited just as long  But as the first response I thank you so much for this i feel you  i dont know if this helps  but there are a lot of people like you who are suffering  who hate themselves  ive felt like you  its gotten better  it gets worse again  but there will always be windows of happiness  just try to hold on to those as tightly as you can  and get help  find someone to talk to  try everything in your power before resorting to an end all  i wishh you the best of luck in learning to love yourself  not crying all the time doesnt mean youre not dealing with heavy things  it doesnt make your problems any lesser  you might be dealing with a mental illness you arent aware of  i would try to find someone to talk to asap  hang in there  I can pm if you would like  I tried to find some other places u could call but most are Canadian or for teens  So ridiculous that people have to wait this long when they are suicidal  I'm so sorry you have to go through this but if you need anything I'm here please stay safe     This might be strange but have u tried getting a pet   I can't gget one  I only rent a small room  and I'm pretty sure there's a no pets rule anyhow    You'll never know what 2030 looks like  or whether trump will last another term  You might meet someone who changes your life  You might get involved in a volunteering position and make a difference   I honestly don't care what 2030 looks like  It's in a world i don't want to remain in     Someone  somewhere  is lying in bed feeling the same way as you   young  alone  hopeless  desperately crying out for help  What would you say to them    "Try to get help  but if you can't and nobody will help you  i wouldn't blame you if you made everything go away" Thank you so much  I cant believe it has been this long  You are very much too nice  I will keep you updated  I started in a queue on 16   I am now 4 on the list   maybe you are depressed  that term is thrown around so lightly  but it is a serious thing that can really affect people  if you havent yet you should talk to a doctor about how youre feeling  all that aside though  i fully get you  i dont know how people do it  i guess you have to find things that you enjoy enough to outweigh the shit that is responsibility  I agree with the above poster  I feel so ill right now that it my cat died I wouldn't be able to feel it  It's part of the numbness that comes with depression  You are build to survive  The reason you can't understand other people right now is because you need attention  Anti depressants are only part of what's on offer  For instance some people do better on antipsychotics  I know I do  Don't do it  If this thought which it is just a thought goes on another day tell one of them people you say care or go to hospital  You are loved  go see another doctor asap  it makes me so upset that people who take an oath to protect others are swayed by money  there is a chance hes being paid by that company to keep you on them  try to go to any other doctor and get their advice  also be careful when just stopping a medication  you should always ween yourself off  so just be aware that things might get worse for a bit after stopping  so just make sure  youre in a safe place for the next little while   I just want to let you know that  I  am praying for  you  and that I hope my prayers will be answered  I hope you gain hope and strength to take that first little baby step toward recovery  I'm praying for you  right now  Much love  good for you  venting really helps  do it as much and as often as you need to  and maybe keep searching for better drs  good luck  you should look for support groups or a professional to talk to  a lot of people dont know how to handle the sadness of others  and instead they can come off as cold or annoyed  id suggest to find places where there are people going through the same thing as you and can sympathize  yet dont have the task of being in your day to day life   also  its not petty or immature  its perfectly normal  please hold on  i really dont know what to say  things seem bleak  and i know it wont help you to say that things will get better cuz there are never any guarantees in life  just know that someone out there cares if you live or die  i hope you hang in there  ill be thinking of you   Thanks for messaging me I appreciate it a lot  I imagine support groups as a bunch of sad people sitting in a circle together and that sounds just really not somewhere I want to be    Also I feel extremely embarrassed or like I'm being clingy if I'm upset when people don't message me back  I broke off a friendship with someone because of them deliberately ignoring me and they got really upset at me for it  man you sound like my boyfriend  to be honest your post helped me understand what he has been trying to communicate to me but i havent been able to "get"  its an uphill battle  they hurt  but what ive found is that its always the hardest right before you get to a plateau  where you can breathe and recoup  if i didnt have people behind me pushing   i would have given u moments before salvation  on a side note  have you tried any kinda meds  how can they get mad at you when they were the one ignoring you  to be fair though  maybe they are also going through shit that you have no clue about  its hard to judge people  we think we know what people go through and deal with but alot of the times people suffer in silence  try to be patient  and hopefully they will be with you as well    as for the support groups  i can see why you'd think that but sometimes the frustration comes when people try to help  but dont truly understand what youre going through  subconsciously i think we pick up on that which makes it easier for us to brush aside  at least give it a try so you can say you tried everything and mean it  if you wanna talk im here  maybe go into a field that makes you matter  to be honest  just being alive to comment of these sort of threads makes you matter  id say try to put your energy towards people that genuinely need help and you will find purpose and you will matter  hang in there No but I was sometimes too happy to hide that I was sent to E   R  Like  that I was able to cut so deep  That was the first times  Now I even don't stitch it anymore  First times doctors where nice   now I have my arms full of scars they treat me like a borderliner  rude   ignoring   I simply can't handle that Well at least he's got you  Not saying that in a foreveralone jpg type way because I'm rejecting people without even giving them a chance now  feels bad man    yeah meds didnt help    edit    sound like a douchebag  now that I think of it  getting a girl would probably be pretty hard since I havent talked or trusted anyone in years they would realize how psycho I am almost immediately  smh   I was in 10th also   I had to drop out cuz of what was happening   I was getting beat up every day  sometimes 2 or 3 times in a day  My counselor was like a total waste  she said I need to quit messing with people or talking smack and I'm like  I'm walking to my class and get rushed   The assistent principal and principal said I need to grow up and quit being a complainer about everything  quit flirting and don't do drugs   I'm like  wtf   I'm living in a different city now  but I'm not sure for how long    What classes do you like best   Can I ask something personel   Why are you going to that topic   If you are depressed  maybe I can help  I can always be that person you can just vent to or just chat  Not sure where You are but Ik that there are suicide help lines that can help  Also google free clinics in ur area and call and ask them also I am bipolar my self and with some time she will go back to her normal self  there are places where you can go that will help with this type of thing Ik there isn't anything about drug use but calling ur local outpatient rehab is often a good place to go  Let me know if things work out  Well  something to consider may be the difference between     I feel like everyone who supports me  is just sick of me and wants nothing to do with me   and    My girlfriend just seems annoyed  So  I am not here to try to convince you to think in one way or the other  However  I would like to point out the significant feeling between  feeling  that people who actually support you  who care about you  are "sick" of you  and dating a girl who may  seem  unappreciative to you  I will explain the reason I use of italics in a moment   In essence  people who support other people are always who care for them in one way or another  At the same time  it is literally impossible to be "sick" of someone and to support them at the same time  So although you may  feel  uncomfortable when you think of  or interact with  the people who support you  it doesn't mean that they feel the same way  Correct me if I am wrong  but I am assuming that it is you who feels uncomfortable around them  because if they were truly or actually "sick" of you  then they would not be supporting you   Something to consider may be  How do you feel when you feel "sick" of someone  You feel annoyed  right   Who is it that  seems  annoyed to you  Your girlfriend  correct   The issue here  to me  seems to be that your girlfriend has been rather unappreciative of who you are  for one reason or another  Essentially  to you  she may  seem  annoyed  but to other people  to me  she might seem like she is emotionally abusing you  or is emotionally toxic    To be perfectly honest  all romantic relationships should be based upon love  or at least  on attraction  And even though it is okay to have a disagreement with one's partner every now and then  to feel a little unhappy or displease with them  is a sign that  the person feeling annoyed  is doing something wrong  You might really like the girl  I can't blame you for not ending the relationship  However  annoyance is the opposite of emotional attraction  It is literally the opposite  And it certainly isn't love  Therefore  it seems to me that she is dating you because some ulterior motives  and I suspect that she may feel good about herself by causing you to feel bad about yourself  Essentially  as she pushes you down so to speak  she may feel as though she is pushing herself up  That is the definition of a toxic person   Even though there is no shame in loving any girl  I suspect that much of your emotional distress has to do with the girl that you are dating  It seems to me that she has caused you to  feel  as though you are not good enough for her  as though you are not worthy  That  feeling  of unworthiness  not actual "unworthiness  just the feeling of it  may have caused you to feel that people who obviously care about you  are "sick" of you  or annoyed  just like the girl who you are dating  seems  to be  Those people who support you  are obviously not annoyed by you because they are supporting you  They care for you  They think that you are more than worthy of support  of help  and of care  All the people on this thread also care about you  about supporting you otherwise we would not be writing to you   I may have generalized a bit or missed a thing or two because the original post wasn't very detailed and specific  However  I seriously suspect that you are in an unhealthy  and toxic  relationship  I heard someone say that 2 people dating can overcome feelings of anger or even resentment towards each other  Forgiveness can make it seem as though it is brand new start with a bright future ahead  However  the feeling of one's partner  or by one's partner  contempt may be impossible to overcome in a relationship because you can be angry at someone who you respect  I know for a fact  that most  if not all people  feel angry at their parents  teachers  loved ones  sisters  brothers  and romantic partners  However  contempt quite literally means disrespect  and respect is essential for love or even friendship  Contempt is something that can't be remedied in a romantic relationship  because if a person dates someone who they feel contempt for or who they feel annoyed by than  that person  is actually okay with being a toxic person and actually wants to be a toxic person  By making you feel bad about yourself  like you are annoying her  she might feel better about her own self  That is her problem not yours    Dude  it sounds like you need to find a new girlfriend who appreciates your texts because I suspect that this girl may be quite literally draining the life out of you  Other people obviously care for you because they support you   I know that might seem like a lot of information based on the small paragraph that you wrote  but there will never be a time when one person being annoyed by the other is a good sign in a romantic relationship  It happens quite frequently  it may be more common than you think  but it always results in the one feeling contemptuous  or "annoyed"  driving the other one  the one who feels affection  into misery  Therefore  I suggest that you act accordingly  and deal with the facts as they are  The facts being that you need to consider things a little more clearly  seeing as how you may need to really take in the fact that everyone who supports you actually cares for you  and there are other things which you may need to recognize and accept for your own emotional health  Thank you  Well  my mom told me the first days after the tragedy i'll be okay  it just needs some time  I don't really know how she will react if i tell her that i feel even worse after 6 months   I'll probably need to close my social media account  because it's a really big deal to me when i see the chats with her  her profile or her latest posts  Even on Steam  i have her on my friends list and when i accidentally see someone playing a game or getting online and has a similar profile pic  i immediately think that she is alive   I remember when i was younger how i was afraid going to the cemetery  but now i feel so calm  when i am near her memorial   For these 6 months  everything changed in me  My interests  everything  Even my favorite colors or songs  Most of the things i loved to do are forgotten   I talked with a suicide prevention online  but they only speak about God  Yes  i respect God  but really if i consider suicide  Bible verses won't help me   I have good friends  but if i tell them all of this  considering the fact 6 months passed it'll be crazy for them   I've always been a strong person  withstanding many things  It's like a horror movie to me  but without an end    I lost other loved ones relatives  but wasn't this bad  compared to now   Usually  when someone asks me how i am  i answer fine  Somehow i am managing always to put a fake smile and their eyes believe what they see  They think i'm fine  But inside me   it's not the same    Sometimes i like to walk close to the train rails  Listening to the music  she listened before the tragic moment  I wanted to die instead of her  Of course i didn't tell nobody because everyone will think that i am going to kill myself  But no  i considered this  but every time i go for a walk or sometimes i feel worse or better  Yes  i thought about suicide of the same way she died  Problem is my friends don't feel bad for her death  but i blame even myself   It's like that when she died  my life ended too    Yes  i have these moments where i have some courage and a big will to kill myself the same way  But it somehow ends before i do it   She was depressed like for 2 months  But she didn't show it  If i could understand it and help her  she won't be dead now   Maybe i need time  I need to stop thinking about her  but always i feel how bad is it to be forgotten and if i forgot her  would be really disrespectful   I have not accepted the fact that she died  Sometimes when i get really sad i text her      Thank you for your kind and encouraging words   My daughter actually called me right after I posted this   She does not follow reddit so did not see this   She is a medical professional and knows what I am going through physically and emotionally  I am calling adult protective services to explain that I feel my mother is a danger   I hope it goes well  I do not think I will act  couldn't do that to daughter   BUT  I do think about it much more than I have since I was a teenager   It really bothers me   I am not in a good place   Tomorrow I have to go get my valuables from her house   I am too stressed to sleep even with chemical aids    I also see my therapist tomorrow   So that is going to be good after the trip to my mother's house    Wednesday is back to work   I will be around different people who are fairly friendly and know nothing about me or my life beyond the superficial   I think it is good to go back to work  Wow man  I'm truly amazed  at 1  How well written and honest your note is and 2  That I played a role in keeping you around a little longer  That's a huge compliment  and as one in the same mental state as you  that means a lot    I'm also wanting to die as soon as possible yesterday 2 years ago for God's sake  Im filled with fear and doubt over it while at the same time wanting it more than anything  It's the most horrible place to be in  The thoughts never cease    You have a serious amount of courage to write the things in that letter    talking about your ego selfishness  but that realizing it only makes the decision to end it more rational  It's a vicious cycle of  logic and failures and reasons  The irony of writing it all out on paper makes you simultaneously know even more deeply that suicide is imperative  by articulating all the reasons why   and then  know that you can actually make yourself feel better by organizing your morbid  desperate thoughts    I really don't know if I have the balls to make it happen  yes  I believe it takes serious balls to attempt a well thought out  years in the making  rational suicide   Again  there's that vicious cycle of twisted reasoning    to have courage  But that's a good thing  so if you're a pussy  then there's yet another reason to off yourself    I really hope you're still around  I would like to talk about this with you more   Ah  I see  I thought you were simply putting down people who act cheerful in the ER  but of course  when you're actually happy about being there  that makes the situation entirely different  i doubt it's the money  im in uk so it is all payed for by government anyway  but it is a she anyway  also  i have stopped around a month ago  and it hasnt affected me I also need to say how much I appreciate you allowing me  and the community  to read your letter  To feel a connection to someone else because you know they're thinking the same way as you and are in the same state of pain and suffering is a powerful thing   Its not about having friends or girls really   I dont want to try dating apps or anything  not for me   Leave it and go far away were noone will know your name  you seem like a jock  not trying to he a cunt  so you will probaly be able to make some friends and get a girlfriend  Im praying for you best of luck in the future mate  Are you ok  Please elaborate on your story  how do you live in captivity  Problems come in all diffrent shapes and sizes dont bash yourself because you think that your problems arnt big  Don't ignore it  fight it  You know you have a bright future  you said it yourself  Why do you think that voice is there  Please don't harm yourself  What exactly happened  Want to talk about it  You were raped  thats so fucked up  send them too prison see how they feeel having the same thing done to them  Go to the police and get these scumbags in jail  Hey  are you ok  Want to talk  Seeing your friend on friday will probably really help  please try to persevere through the week so you can see her  We can talk things out please dont kill yourself  it's fine  You can talk to me mate dont kill yourself well talk this out  Seems like a little more then that we can talk about it and ill give you some advice  I feel that you are right and that sometimes so called "trained professionals" seem to be apathetic and may seem to be simply reading some sort of script  I personally  feel that feeling empathy and care brings about the best possible advice and insight in order to help people    Therefore  forgive me if I cannot empathize with everything that you are going through  a break up  the mourning of those who moved on to something else  and abandonment issues  are a lot to deal with and process  I personally feel that you are dealing with something which may take some time to process  and may be tough to overcome   However  I think that if we are to pick just one issue to focus on and resolve  it may be helpful to try and resolve  or deal with  the abandonment issues  That is just my personal opinion  I say this  or write this  because of how you wrote    It's not just the breakup   abandonment from my so called father   Everyone leaves me  Now  I am not giving you any professional advice or anything of that nature  but given the circumstances  I think that it may be of some use to try to calm the waters so to speak  To help you think clearly  To relax  and to help you see things a little more clearly so that you may feel comfortable enough to reach Friday  when you will meet your friend  in good health and safety   I think that the issue to recognize here  is that your father  or "so called father"  or any term that you would like to apply to him  did not actually abandon  you   per say  The reason I say this is that many kids who know that one of their parents walked out on them  usually the dad  blame themselves for it   However   the father's action's say nothing about the kids themselves  For example  if you were to see a 5 year old girl  and she were to tell you that her father walked out on her  would you tell her that she is worth less because of it  That is she is less lovable because of it  Of course not  Or I hope not  You might instead tell her that it is going to be okay  you might buy her an ice cream  maybe a toy  and tell her that it is going to better  However  you might then go home and tell your friend that you met this poor little girl  and then to your friend  you might tell her that the father was rather irresponsible and that he might not have realized just how precious and that adorable girl was  That girl which you may have made feel better by giving her an ice cream or something of this nature    In the same way  I do not mean to be harsh  but your father was not responsible for you  he was irresponsible  It is not your problem  it is his  You are valuable like any other person  but some people don't know what real value is  They really don't  I know that there are plenty of people who are mean to their dogs  even puppies  who chain them  and who kick them or slap them  It is not the puppy's or the dogs fault  The puppies are just as cute regardless of what mean or irresponsible people do to them  Actually  those puppies may need more love because they have been hurt by other people  Because they may need more love  they may be "worth" more love   Therefore  I suggest that you consider what type of person you are basing your self worth  your life's worth on  It takes a special kind of person to abandon a child  and it takes a special kind of person to manipulate  or emotionally abuse their romantic partner  Their girlfriend  Therefore  it may help you to realize that those people are not essentially kind people  That says nothing about you  it just means they are not kind people    I hope this makes you feel better  if not  please let me know how I may better help you  or if there is anything that I need to explain or clarify     i keep on drifting towards it because I did something terrible  nothing that a friend would do  fake an illness  but later did they knew  they had the fucking illness  I can't talk to my close friends because the friend I apologised to were online friends  and we are planning to meet up one day  My closest real life friends don't know I talk to them  I've tried distracting myself many times  mainly on the reason I use to self harm so I frequently looked up alternatives  I kept on losing blades so that's why I stopped  pm will be fine if you want  Yes he's OK  he's at my mom's and she's keeping an eye on him   Thanks for asking   Glad to hear you talked to your daughter and also that you'll be getting to see your therapist and the friendly folks at work  Good luck with adult protective services  That sounds like the right thing to do  I was in a sitaution awhile back where I probably should have done the same thing on behalf of a loved one and held off  and I regret not calling them at the time  as hindsight now shows I should've    So I am glad you are able to take a positive action in your own situation    As far as thinking about suicide more often than you used to when you were younger goes  I know what you mean  I guess it can vary among people whether it increases or decreases with age  but it's maybe dependent on circumstances  Increased responsibility coupled with aging and other issues   it might feel much more overwhelming than maybe it did when one is younger  more carefree  naive  or whatever      As someone who has started to get acquainted with similar feelings  I found this little  short  book that I found helpful and I was able to find it  posted online  http   web archive org web 20150327001550 http   artf5 tripod com alcoholicrecovery id6 html    You might maybe find it just as helpful to read too    Anyway  I hope you are sleeping fine now as I post this  You are in my prayers  if that's cool with you  In any case  have a good night and a good day tomorrow and thank you again for sharing  Find yourself a new life travel far away keep yourself occupied  get on the train and keep going or get on your car and

she went  and we found it by her PE locker  We used to talk and stuff and she was like my friend I could talk to about life and me and stuff and not be judged   But she moved and I was alone again  with my judgement friends   Sorry for talking so much  Basically I wouldn't mind being friend zoned by girls because they be friends and i could get better at talking to girls in general but nope they don't let me speak and do all the talking and end up coming to a conclusion on their own that I'm not good enough to be in their presence  Girls just don't seem to like me period and I guess that's why I get so bummed it would be nice to have a friend that is of the opposite sex because most of my guy friends talk about shit I'm not really interested in half the time and don't talk about their life  I honestly don't think I'm going for the wrong type of girl because I can kinda only try to talk to girls that aren't the center of attention and are quite because they seem nicer but still nothing   I don't know why  I've had this voice telling me to do this ever since elementary school  I know deep down that killing myself is wrong  but I make excuses to feel differently and refuse to accept it  This sounds a little crazy  but sometimes I feel like something that's not me controls my emotions and feelings sometimes  some inner force or urge that needs me to die   She says I'm too much for her and she blocked me I didn't even know there was a problem she didn't give me a chance to fix it I am sorry you experience so much suffering   I can relate that memories am indeed really painfull  But from another perspective you can be certain that the past is gone  has happened and is not the present  nor is it the future  You are strong  because you endured all of this  But I want you to know that every day you have the chance of change   The present moment is where you can have an impact for the future    I want you to know that as long as you are breathing there are options to getting rid of all the suffering in your mind    If you want to talk I am willing to listen   Just life im just not bothered to do anything i have no motivation  you seem like you have a few threads left of that   You know  I really appreciate what you guys have said  and I really fucking tried  If I fail chemistry again for the final exam  then it's lights out for me   I don't self harm for scars but I do love them  There is something about the way they look and the mark they leave on my body that I have fallen in love with  I am very sorry that you are in so much pain  I want to assure you that you are not worthless  Every day you are not harming anyone you are contributing to someones happiness and any good deed  as small it may be  can mean the world to someone else    If you are not sure if I am really understanding your situation feel free to tell me more about what bothers you  I am always willing to listen   this is my duty   Please don't listen to it  Have you considered trying out a therapist  Maybe they've heard of similar situations and can better help you out  She seems like a narcisistic peice of shit  sort it out in person she wont be able to run away then  people come and go in life  and a bestfriend while your young  assuming your young  isnt the same connection of a best friend as an adult  Hope things get better  I am really sorry that you are experiencing all this suffering in your life  You say you want to care for someone and love someone  Why not start with yourself  You are worthy of your own love  of your own praise and companionship  You are always the person you can count on 100   Why depend on some external factor you can not control    The only thing that is certain in this life is that everything is constantly changing  Of course that means that nothing good remains forever  but that also means that the bad stuff is not staying forever as well    If you want to talk or think I am misunderstanding you feel free to answer   Write a paper about how you feel about this  Post it somewhere in the house  pack your bags and leave    Hell make them think you offed yourself or just some shit I don't know  But leave that situation  I'm sure your a dope ass brother just move along and know there is always something out there for you  Seven Pounds is an excellent movie  It shows how one person decided to make his death mean more than his life  However  that doesn't mean that everyone will be that fortunate  Some methods destroy too much of the body to be useful for organ harvesting  and some methods are just really nasty   My suggestion is to not just watch the movie with him  but to discuss the movie  and your feelings about it  You can then kinda start talking about your own feelings on suicide  I personally am having problems  and might have lost my boyfriend because I told someone else  not because I wanted to tell this person first  that I have had a date set if things weren't good by that date  Told my bf that my friends threat was effective  which led into me telling him about my own thoughts  He didn't appreciate that I was willing to tell this other guy  rather than him  first  So yeah  I know what thoughts of suicide are like  watch some louis ck man its cracking me up right now That's ok don't be sorry  And yeah people think I'm a total bitch too because I don't talk to anybody  but that's just because I'm not a very social person  And yeah I agree around grade 4 is when school stopped being so fun and it seems like everyone kind of drifted away and just left me behind  I moved schools in grade 6 and from that point on  I have never had a best friend or any really close friends  Just people I talk to in class and occasionally text  Also  I'm doing pretty well as far as grades go  but these days I will find any excuse I can to miss school  I'm not sure about laws in the US  but I live in Canada and here it is illegal to for another guy to share nude pics of you with other people if he doesn't have your consent  You could always look into pressing charges against the boy  I think what he did could qualify as distribution of child pornography  because you are under 18  But I totally understand if you just want to put the situation to rest too  because of all the pain it has caused you  Anyways  what kinds of things are you interested in  Any ideas on what you want to do for future careers  I kinda just want to get on with my life   He is 17 so idk what all they can do   The way the cops are here  unless there are like weapons involved  they don't care about anything else  oh yeah  large amounts of drugs  they get involved with that too   Or if I was like a 5 year old  the might care    Don't laugh  but I'm doing a serious look at my life and I was always expected to be perfect   My whole life was the church  making my mom proud and happy   If I was ever sad or feeling down  I was being a moody  selfish  ungrateful good for nothing loser  What is so wrong in my life that I feel down   The bishop took the memory card and idk if he kept it or destroyed it or what   The pics really werent bad  i mean im not all spread out and stuff  just  me sitting usually or kneeling looking at him or the mirror or cam   The vids are what is bad and got my mom all upset I think   At least I think she saw them cuz when she came home  she hit me and then kicked me out  saying all kinds of things    How often do you think about dying   It is always on my mind  Don't start cutting  What you are currently doing is certainly SH but probably scratching more than cutting  No one form of SH is more valid than another so don't feel bad about it though  Please don't start  ask pretty much anyone here and they will say the same  You start it as a method of control but eventually it will control you  You say you have no interest in cutting down to the fat now but I don't think many of us did when we started  I certainly didn't and now I'm almost obsessing over it  Have a look at  this  http   www adolescentselfinjuryfoundation com page11  list of random alternatives and  this  http   www teenhelp org forums f12 self harm t9418 alternatives self harm   list of alternatives by emotion triggering them   As far as infection risk goes  I doubt you have much risk of infection as the skin is largely intact  Infections can only get in where the top most layers of the skin  epidermis  has been broken and lower layers of skin body exposed  so the more exposed lower layers  the more risk of infection  I can't find the source so sorry if that breaks the rules  feel free to remove mods   Skin is only about 2mm thick   source  http   www enchantedlearning com subjects anatomy skin    so be careful as 1mm is actually reasonably deep  You should always have access to equipment to sterilise equipment and clean up wounds whenever you SH but you shouldn't need anything major like steri strips to begin with    But honestly  don't start  you don't want to go down this route  Have a nice day evening night    hey   i've seen the stuff in shpics as well and i don't think you need to be worried at all about infection in those  even most deeper cuts heal fine with basic wound care  using some type of wound cleanser such as tea trea oil  hyodrogen peroxide etc and a topical gel such as manuka honey or neosporin and keeping it covered   changing the dressings  or drugstore butterfly stitches steri strips  the wounds you've described should be perfectly fine as long as you keep an eye on them    as for if you do decide to start cutting with any type of blade and drawing blood  as long as you do not cut through the dermis  it'll show as being the white bit before the yellowish fat tissue   you should not have much of an issue at all  and like i said earlier even most deeper cuts end up being ok  though i would always encourage others to seek medical attention for cuts to fat   again basic wound care would do  the only things i would keep on hand are   a wound cleanser like hydrogen peroxide   a topical wound gel like neosporin or manuka honey  i prefer the latter but that's cause i'm weird and pretentious  it's more expensive and neosporin works fine frankly    bandages  depending on how many wounds you have at once their proximity to each other  you could get small ones or ones that cover large areas    lastly  always clean your blades if you reuse them  and don't reuse them too much if you do  some people always replace them  imo that's not quite necessary but it IS necessary to keep them spick n span  i bought a giant pack of alcohol prep pads and i use one at the end of each session to clean my blade with    i'm not sure why you're needing to self harm but i really encourage you to look for some healthy coping skills as fake and therapisty as that sounds  i don't know if professional help is available to you but that can be immensely helpful as well if you find the right person   in the meantime just be safe with your SH as it sounds you intend and desire to be  if you wanna chat about anything or have any further questions please please PM me    edit  i'm not used to being on this sub  i'm from shpics  so i'm sorry if any of this is against the rules    i wish i would've been told this when i first started self harming  i looked around for a lot of basic info like this and just got told to stop and had to learn the hard way the limits of the body    edit again  here's a general source sorry http   www thesourcenatural com ns DisplayMonograph asp storeID dhap6v4fb7sr2nm700akhlbd3cmfbxmd DocID dhea but i'm training in this stuff currently so consider me one as well tbf    Drop everything and go  You said you've done this once  but what have you got left to lose now  Get a flight to fuck knows where  get all your money together  just get away  I believe in you    Care to elaborate on why you feel this way  I'm all ears 21 is kind of the start of your real life  although really it can be any age     Sounds like you need to put some space between you and people that are no longer healthy for you to be around and start a new life walking in a new direction  You will eventually meet the people you fit with    21 is just the start though  a fresh start  it is not the end I promise  I asked my GP about it but he said even if he prescribed the transfusion I wouldn't get it   I had to stay in the hospital overnight a few days ago   drunk selfharm  and they all mentioned how pale I looked but didn't do a bloodtest or anything    I've been severly anemic  5 8g dl  for over a year now  That's why I am holding up so "well" with levels that low    I am super afraid of just randomly going to the ER saying I don't feel good because they probably won't take me seriously and that's not the kind of things they're made for   And I am so so so afraid of having to justify myself    u jjuuuu How did you end up in hospital  Did you go by yourself  My symptoms aren't that dramatic yet so idk if they'd just send me away  nope  thanks  and you   maybe  i could help you with something in return  Honestly for me its the latter  IMO living just so family friends wont be sad is a terrible reason to live and hate your own life  I wish I could see things like you do  you're a kind soul That's totally understandable  My parents were raised catholic  and I am baptized  had my first communion and confirmation but I never really believed in God  It just seems way too far fetched and irrational and I hate the idea of living my life for somebody else  I have thought about killing myself  but never to the point of actually attempting  I just have to consider my perspective when I feel like there is no point to my existence  I remember that if I were to do anything  yes it would cause pain to my loved ones  but like everybody else that has died  I will be forgotten and people will get over it  Also  I am living for ME  I will do what makes ME happy and I will constantly ask questions that intrigue me and I will do whatever I love  For me  that means pursuing a career in the sciences and discovering why the hell we age  Why can't it be stopped  I know this idea is absolutely crazy but I feel it's my life calling and I am going to do my best to answer this question  It's something I think about every single day  and I just have this feeling that there has to be something more  Just try and remember to do what makes you happy  Sometimes this will mean going against others wishes  but that is okay  As far as we know  we only have one life to live and you should do whatever you want with it  If you constantly try and please others  it will drain you  And it is ok to be sad or feel down  This is normal and one cannot be expected to be happy and perfect all of the time  This year  I actually have a new years resolution that I want to carry throughout my life  practice self love and do what makes me feel good and what makes me happy  and accept myself for where I am at right now  but also set goals for the future and have expectations  I hope we both can learn to love ourselves and do what is best for us  I know things are hard right now  but not too long from now you will be an adult and can fully make decisions for yourself  Just a few more years of this bullshit  Until then  keep fighting and doing what you think is best for you  Canada sounds awesome  I've never been but I've heard it's beautiful and the people are super friendly  You can do overland tours I think   which take in all the lakes and glaciers and stuff   Thanks for your writing   I'm always trying to put my mind to text    I don't know  friend  I certainly don't know the situation as well as you  but it sounds more to me like she rejected you only out of the interests of her friendships  That really says nothing about you as a person  merely about the tricky situation that you've found yourself in  having dated Girl1 and now being attracted to Girl3  But  it's certainly up to you  and I don't want to push you into doing something that you don't want to   I do want to stress that this isn't inevitable  and that you both can be and are in control of your life  You can make choices  you can change things  You  can  talk to your friends  You can find new friends if these friends don't care about you the way that they should   I also think  if you feel that you can't talk about these things with the people in your life  you could talk about them with a professional  Do you have a therapist  If not  is therapy an option for you  Alright  how you doin'     There have been so many empty promises from people  including from myself  that things would change and things have only got worse  I've alienated nearly everyone I know  slowly been destroying my future and just can't deal with any of the shit I've created for myself now  There's nothing I feel like it's worth sticking around for  Can you talk to your parents  Do you still live with them or alone  A psychologist can probably help you  One of the things I learned about self harm is if you have a poor childhood pain can indeed start to feel like it's love  I would say seek out a psychologist and if you are still a minor tell your parents  i have no idea where and how everything went wrong  i feel completely alone and hopeless  Welcome     I have that is  I'm 29 and had a good group of friends  Slowly they all disappeared  We can't handle the mental health issues and the crying and not answering your phone  I am also an alcoholic so I got ditched anytime there is a holiday or a Friday night or anything that wasn't breakfast  In the end I think we all need to learn to be alone  Because you can't count on anyone to not either A  Use you or B abuse you are some combo of those two  Most people do not give a shit  I would say do not search out brand new people  Talk to your family or parents get a therapist  Do not make connections with people who may just walk out  Not advisable at this point  It makes you way more depressed when they leave  Glad you have found a support place in such a trying time of your life  I hope things go as smoothly as possible for you  It's wonderful to hear that you found the strength to keep going and made it through the darkness  I wasn't here three years ago but I share the sentiments others have expressed  Very  very happy for you  sweetie  thank you for replying  it made me feel a little less lonely  it really means so much to me  I didn't really think anyone would reply  it was more just to get this off my chest   3 I don't know about bleach  but some chemicals burn from the inside out   so they will appear not so bad  but actually have caused a lot of trauma underneath    Burns are usually more infection prone than cuts as they take longer to heal  and usually have a larger surface area  So please keep it covered and looked after    Thank you so much for the reply  it means more than you could imagine  I don't feel so alone anymore  I saw my doctor and she signed me off for a few weeks to try and get back on track  but I also found out that my contract at work was never permanent and it now finishes on Friday because they have no hours for me anymore  So at least I'll have a little time to get myself together  Thank you for giving me hope  Also  love the username   3 Love you  3 Hi  I am sorry you feel your life isnt worth living another year  Every new year  and birthday  I feel the same   I don't really have any advice  but I wanted to discuss your revelation further as I have been in a similar boat     "Happiness triggers me"   is something I use to relate to sooooo much  I use to hate anything positive  anything good  whether it happened to me or to someone else  I longed for insults  for abuse from my partners     you know why  Because it is   familiar    I hate myself so much  I punish myself  insult myself  hurt myself   it is reasonable to think that that is what I am accustomed to  I know what pain and abuse is  It is familiar to me  I know how to cope when someone hurts me    but you know what I don't know  What to do when someone is nice  It is so uncomfortable  So foreign  So unknown  It throws me off   I half expect the niceness to be a "joke" before the abuse  I cannot understand it  Why would someone be nice  To get to know me before they hurt me  Maybe they are only nice because they dont   know   me    they don't know the   real   me    I know that I am a monster  so I want everyone else to know it too      Anyway  If you can even remotely relate to anything I wrote above   there is some hope because it can get better with a lot of mental work  I have been working on accepting "nice" from people  It is hard  I still hate my guts and wish myself dead most days  But  some days I can accept something nice   and it feels good      idk   First goal is to do no harm  By that I mean do no harm to others  People make mistakes  but if you have lived most of your life without hurting or otherwise causing pain to others then already you are not a failure  You are a living breathing human being and if you live your life not hurting others then you are already doing significantly better than a lot of people out there so take a moment to say well done    You ask for reasons to continue on  The opportunity to help others  After you live a life of no unnecessary harm to others then you can move on to helping others  Food shelters  food vans  local libraries  there are countless venues that need human hands and brains and compassion so there is a shining reason for you to stick around   A kissless virgin  Human contact is important absolutely   but these things take time and effort and consistent reflection  Talk about what is going on  Let's talk it out here  Can you give us examples  What has happened in the past  Talk to us mate  You have come to the right place  The emerging internet culture is just geared towards keeping our attention span as long as possible  which they most achieve by giving us small dopamin rewards for miniscule shit  studying does not do that  https   www youtube com watch v 50R21mblLb0 Look at this video for the details of what I am desciribing   Now if you are somehwat like me you manage to "blaze" through elemntary without sutdying or doing homework  thus never learning  at a young age  to ever put any actual work into anything  resulting into a really strong aversion to anything that dosent feel good for you  My way of coping usually is to disconnect myself from any technology and only allow myself to get it back once I learned for a sufficient amount of time  Of course there are days were that dosent work at all  but there are also days were it works fine  Keep in mind that your struggle with lazyness is going to be a constant in your life  you might need more time to actually achieve something then other people  dont be too hard on yourself  take your life at the best pace you can  Best of luck  Hey there   thank you for the update and im really happy to know things start to work out for you  I guess "Happy New Year" is now even more appropriate    Hi  have you considered googling anger management  I think that would benefit you greatly    I know all too well the "up my body like red in a thermometer" feeling   if I hold off  I can feel the heat jolt down my arms and into my fists    I found that initially mindfulness  a meditation technique used in multiple different therapies  helped a great deal  It taught me how to stay in the moment  to let the anger rush back and forth through me  to feel it all  It made anger that only took 10 seconds to turn into an outburst  start to take 60 seconds    Then  with that extra time I managed to scrape together   I found other ways to cope  Usually 2 ways  1  Forgive and radically accept the issue  and 2  Release the anger physically    Learning to forgive myself and accept my mistakes really reduced my anger all around  Learning to accept that noone is perfect   it really helped me "let go" of the anger  In those "let go" moments though  the anger builds to a head  then I let it go   I breathe it out  and run my fingers over my face trying to calm myself  This took   a lot   of therapy      Releasing anger physically is the easier way because it is fast acting  Anger is our "fight" response  We are filled with adrenalin because we are meant to act  But oftentimes in modern society we are angry for other reasons  or reasons that we cannot take action for  So    act in another way  Release the fight  the adrenalin   exercise  Do star jumps  Scream into a pillow  Go run as long as you can  Exhausting yourself can help a ton    Anyway  Hope you read this and got something from it  Good luck  Firstly a suggestion  if you're not on iron tablets you should start taking them  Your body will recover on its own if you stop loosing blood  although it will take about a month to do so completely   Whether they transfuse or not probably depends mostly on your symptoms  If they think that your life is at risk I'm sure they will do it but if you're just walking a fine line they might wait  Make sure you get as many blood tests as you can so your doctor can monitor your Hb  When I was ill I had them weekly for quite a while   I got a phone call from my doctor after school telling me that I either had to get my parents to take me into hospital or they would get the police to come and take me instead  I didn't have a choice and went with the easier option  I was very sick and if I had self harmed that night I think I would have had a heart attack     The second time I had a transfusion I was away with some friends and they took me  my Hb was 7g l I think  Where I live if it is below 7 they always transfuse  Both times I was given 1 unit  about 330ml  of packed red blood cells  which is about equivalent to getting 660ml of "normal" blood   What you did was cry for help  in the safest way possible  You wanted someone  anyone  to show you some compassion  It may help to look at this as two issues  firstly  your real friends  You seem to feel guilty because you haven't told them of these online friends but why should you  I love bigfoot  pimple popping and ghost hunting  but none of my real friends know  That's the beauty of the internet   I can enjoy my hobbies with like minded ppl  but spend fun time with real friends doing other stuff  I have no doubt that all your real friends chat to other ppl online    Also  it's private and anonymous  So stop beating yourself up  Most ppl with depression hide it from those closest to them   family  friends   they go online  But seeing a doctor is the best action  Get help from a therapist   As for the online issue  very few ppl are honest  most are untruthful to a greater or lesser degree  Ppl lie about their age  their looks  their qualifications  their sexuality  their wealth  or lack of it   everything  You have been honest by admitting to an illness you don't have  but you have no idea if the person you are chatting to has been honest with you   Why not tell your online 'friends' that you are taking a break  Go talk to a real Doctor  Go spend more time with your real friends  Put the 'illness story' in the past where it belongs and focus on your future  Does that seem like a good idea  X Nothing is wrong with you  everyone suffers a lot because of the stress in school  not just tests  but socialising  learning  doing work  having to speak in public    It's a great source of anxieties  only people express it in different ways   For some reason  you express it that way  but don't think that means you are wrong somehow  It just means your brain makes a connection between stress and relief from it by escaping  while other people may see that relief in just not thinking about it or in finishing it as soon as possible to be "free" from it   And once your brain has seen the "path" is relief by escaping  it's as easy to find that escape in death as in flying home or changing studies or not passing the course  It doesn't mean you are bounded or something like that  just that your brain took that reference that way that time   You need to find another way to deal with your anxieties  maybe try not to escape but to face it  finishing it as soon as possible  Try it and see how that works  but with any issue feel free to tell here  or PM me  or whoever and however you feel like  People will understand and maybe even help  Or at least listen to you I'm very sorry for what happened to you  I just want to say that you're very young and still have an entire life ahead of you    I'm 28 and still aren't sure what I want or of life  Just give it a little time    A permanent solution to a temporary problem just isn't the way to go  Trust me  lost my little sister and it eats away at my soul everyday  Well  I always try my best to not hurt people  and to be the best for everyone  by being kind  selfless  etc   I am always trying to be the best person to those around me  I hope I am good for people     That is a good idea  Perhaps I could try to help those who are in need of help  I think I will have a look on that    Yes  I too find human contact absolutely important  Well  examples    I have been kinda attacked  physically  by people who I thought were friends    I had a father who was cheating on my mother and it's not that great of a person    Also  his job required us to move a lot  So  in the process  I didn't really had much friends when I was a kid  except my cousins  who I have always been pretty close with  but I wasn't living in the same city as them anymore  and I had to stay at my room  writing  talking to an imaginary friend because that's all could have   And it stayed like that for quite a while  No friends  The only thing I could do was play video games or use the PC  I wasn't very liked at school  etc   I think I can give more examples     tfw too late to the thread    oh well  repressed all that too much anyway  don't really want to think about it   ran away from home on 2 1 2016  totally forgot to celebrate it yesterday though   Og  If I talked to my parents  they would just get mad at me and say "depression isn't real"  or "you're just trying to get attention" or some crap like that  Hey  my name's David and I'm sixteen  I'm in school right now so I'm just leaving a quick comment to say that I'll be able to contact you in a little while  You don't deserve an ounce of the pain you're feeling and I want to do whatever I can to help  Talk to you later   Oh I've been on iron tablets infusions for a year but even without selfharming it always took longer than a month to get to somewhat decent levels again      My GP won't do any more bloodtests  He gave up on me  He also called me saying he should actually section me  but he didn't    As far as My symptoms go   I am fine when I am lying  down  Resting heart rate of 100bpm  feeling dizzy while standing up  angina pains heart rate 160bpm while walking  I didn't faint in a while though  And I mainly want a transfusion to be able to work  Idk if it's bad enough   Hurting yourself is a cry for attention  It's saying help me I am in so much pain and can not deal on my own please someone see this and help me  There is nothing wrong with needing help and not wanting to feel lonely  Maybe open up to a teacher as much as you can  If you tell an adult like a teacher or school nurse and ask to see a counselor they will see you get to the school counselor  They have to  By law  Humans are social creatures we all biologically need other people in our lives  It is how the human race survived  By being social                An interesting study on loneliness and drug addiction was performed on lab rats  One group of rats was kept in isolation in their own little cages with no sight or contact with other mice  The other social group was kept in a big cage all together  Both groups were given water and drugged water  Only the rats in isolation would drink the drugged water  On top of signs of anxiety and depression  When taken out of isolation and put in with the social rats the isolated ones stopped drinking the drugged water and lost the signs of mental issues  First of all  I'm homeschooled  so talking to a teacher or school nurse isn't an option  Second  I have really bad social anxiety  so talking to other people in general probably won't happen  But  I did tell  through texting  two of my friends about how I'm feeling and one of them said that she's going to have a talk with me next time we see each other  which is this friday  Sounds like you are having a hard time with that  However I would caution that Gay Lesbian people come in all forms  With all different kinds of beliefs and interests  Counseling might help  And be kind to yourself  Find love where you can and then hold it tight  A very good quote I find helps me when I Am confused by the many different beliefs and thoughts I hold is "In every corner of my soul is a shrine to a different god " We as a human race are so varied and just because you like Rocky Road ice cream doesn't mean you can't still go out hunting  Just means whoever you love might stay home and make cookies while your out enjoying your other activities   The thing is is that I have no real interests  I can't do anything that I want to do with my life so why bother  Good for you  Hope to never see on this board agian    I can't get rid of the gun  I got it for becoming an Eagle Scout and it's hanging in my room but it's fully functional  I just don't want to be around  I don't see a point    that's definitely bad enough  If you can get your self to a hospital they should really consider a transfusion  or perhaps intravenus iron  i've had about 5 of those   I think you should just keep going to hospital  saying you have heart palpataions   chest pains  They're sure to run some blood tests and hopefully give you the treatment you need If you have taken a large amount of paracetamol  you really need to go to hospital  Paracetamol takes days to kill you  You might feel okay now  but you'll feel the effects soon and by the time you feel ill enough to feel it warrants a trip to the hospital  it'll be too late to reverse  It's okay  I reached out to a friend that was still awake at the time  I feel really embarrassed but it's better than suicide or  self harm  Steam  e Lo Just wanting to make a new friend I was never liked in school  Never had my own computer  Verbally abusive step dad and a distant mother who worked 12 14 hour days  Spent a lot of time outdoors with my dog  I am not going to say it gets better  I have had ups  Good ups  And downs  Bad downs  I know what it is like to be down and alone  So sad you can't take another second and your mind is flooded with very bad ideas  It is hard to think about it  But Life Does Have an Up Side Coming  Light Will Shine Agian  And when you feel so sad and in pain and want to let go  Hug yourself  Mentally and physically feel that pain and hold it like you would a sad child  It works for me sometimes  Oh really  I am so sorry for that  I didnt know it can damage our nerves forever    Are you okay now  Do you still do it  Maybe you should tell her you really think you need help and don't know how to get it  Maybe even confide that you don't think your parents will help at all  If she tells another adult like her parents it is very likely the adults will talk with your parents  And you will get help  Or if you have a doctor your close to pretend your sick to go tell them  But I really do think if you tell your parents how sad you are they will help   Text both your friends your really sad and need help but don't know how to reach out  Have them ask their parents to help  I know  I didn't care if it's gonna be painful at that point  I was afraid the other pills weren't enough  I'm overseas and my student insurance doesn't cover anything like that  I don't have money either   Both of my friends already know that I need help  I realize that it's mostly my fault for not getting any  but I honestly want to cut  It feels good  I'm not sure if I want to give it up  Go to hospital fir following reasons  paracetamol can cause irreversable liver damage in high doses and physically your life could be in danger recieve some sedation for your depression anxiety because your mental health could also be putting your life in danger  Dont give up because of an idiot in the hotline or one even at the hospital  There are lots of people who dont deserve to work in the health sector but there are still many who really can help  Some people end up with entirely useless arms  some end up with weakened arms  You can damage your nerves and muscles forever  once it's damaged  these things don't heal  especially nerves  Once severed  there's not chance of getting your arm back   I'm alright  I luckily never severed anything important  well  so important that I can't use my arm  I can't feel my hand  it hurts to tense my muscles  but it still works to an extent  I still SH  I stopped for 3 years  but a relapse has forced me back to square one   I'll add you in four hours  when wifi should work  3 It's not a who has it worse competition  Sometimes when I am in such a dark place  and I have attempted suicide  I had my stomach pumped with charcoal  And more recently did 18 600 dollars worth of damage to my car and walked away without a scratch    I let myself feel the physical and mental pain  Dive into it  Not the thoughts but the actual hurt  And hug it  Like you would hug a crying child  It helps to physically hug yourself as well  And tell the pain and yourself that you love them  Seriously it does work sometimes  Couldn't you try this first  And seek counseling  Tell someone  Call the suicide hotline  Something  Talk to someone  I don't have health insurance for hospital and no money  I'm overseas   I've been in medication for depression all my life and tried 30 different things  I've been in therapy for over 8 years every week  I'm a failure  thanks though  I know about paracetamol damaging the liver  I unfortunately was aware of that and didn't care     thanks  Help will be a good thing  It is so hard to say things sometimes  It hurts but after slowly it gets easier to repeat the words about your pain  And to talk about other things that are hard  I hope you have the opportunity to see a therapist while you are waiting  Oh I understand it  Thanks for your answer  Well I dont know what to say but stay safe   You're not weak for having emotions  Everyone has them  I really hope you find something that helps you  Maybe there's some support groups in your city  Take care of yourself   I would say it is not your fault for not getting help  I'm 29 and it is still hard for me to seek help and there are times I dont  When I was your age I did not seek help  And it just kept getting worse  Growing bigger  I still have big downs  I have good ups sometimes as well  Besides what I identify with and learned about self harm  is when you have a hard childhood sometimes pain can start to feel like home and love  It is also for me a way to express my pain because I almost can not cry in front of people  But once I start talking about one life hard point I find it gets easier and easier to talk about more issues that are blocking your  Happiness  I hate people  I doubt i want to go to a counsellor  fuck that  they wouldnt be able to fix any of my problems   I can't do anything that I want to do   What do you want to do  Why can't you do it     I'm being serious  Tell me what you would like to do and why you can't start on the path to that dream  Even if you don't end up at that exact vision you may end up somewhere better or somewhere close or connected to it  I don't have all the answers only 30  years of life but just talking to someone you often find your own answers   You too  Going deep is not worth the risk   It must be awful  I can't even begin to imagine how horrible you must feel    You said that the "nuthouses" and clinics couldn't offer you the help you need  Have you been there before and had a bad experience   I felt like that when they first hospitalised me  I thought  I dunno  that I was the "most" mentally ill and they couldn't do anything  I was too bad of a case and it was meaningless  But then I went  and the first week was awful  but by the end of the second week I really felt heard    I'm sorry your girlfriend left you like that  Do you have anyone you might be able to share your feelings with   I have auite for that  "Depression is just anger without enthusiasm "  Is there a free clinic near you  Where are you overseas  Some countries that have free healthcare offer it even to tourists  Please seek medical attention   Being gay in this society is hard  Not only do you have to face homophobia from the rest of the world  but there's also internalised homophobia that is just as dangerous    Is there a LGBT community or support group near you  I think it could really help if you found people that share your experiences and feelings  I think you'll find that there's more diversity in the community than the skinny  white boys media offers us   It would be a start  It would be something  Why not  If your going to go through one very painful event how can seeing a therapist even just once be that bad  Sometimes talking to someone getting even a little bit of heaviness off your chest works  Humans are meant to be social animals  We survived as a species that way  I feel so uncomfortable  a failure  loser angry at myself  hopeless  beyond horny and squirming at the thought that people are able to get someone no problem and i have my dick in my hand all the time  More than that too just helpless and lost  Ive been to two nuthouses and they just sit with you  theow pills at you and let you go in a few days  We have THE worst mental health care in US  I have noone to talk to my parents get frustrated with me that i dont act better and i lost all my friends to a misunderstanding a year ago  I know the feeling  man  I'm in the army now  and the idea of suicide doesn't bother me  If anything  it brings me comfort to know that it's an option   Stay alive because you should exhaust all other options before you decide on a permanent one  Have you talked to a therapist  I know your not a tattoo person but if the cover up doesnt work and your in a bind you could always use temporary tats   I don't want to bother my grandparents about this  they re good people  but no the ones I'd share this too  I don't know how to talk to my lil brother  maybe  there's people  but I'm afraid to tell them because I might not get my feeling into words  thanks    See  you already know what it is you want to become  Only thing missing is practice and a teacher  which could be a psychotherapist    From our thinking neurological pathways in our brain are created  I believe that you have the power to get rid of the negativity in your mind and transform it into something nice  You endured suffering  which shows that you are a strong person    I wish you all the positivity in the world  It was never your fault  It's those guys' fault and they are lying to you  Report what happened to the police  Hope those guys gets a nice long stay in prison  Also  you should go to a crisis center for help  I'm sorry you feel that way  I've been in a similar position before  If you want to talk about it I'm more than happy enough to listen    Bad helplines are horrible  often leaving you feeling worse than you did before  but there are some good ones in every country  where they do care about what you've been through  and try and understand  I hope you find one that works for you before it is too late   The most important thing though is dealing with the effects of your attempted OD  You definitely need to visit a hospital  You mention your abroad right now  which sounds wonderful  What country are you in  If it's anywhere in the EU you should get free healthcare   I'm in Australia right now  I'm from the EU  I can only talk to a gp tomorrow and see what she says  I have no money and my visa is going to expire  I can maybe just afford the flight  I still have no intention to make it back alive  I've been living in Australia for years and I have no home or friends back there and I'm going to be homeless  I know all my options and I have zero  thanks to all of you  I just needed someone to talk to  I know the effects of paracetamol Tylenol  I knew and I didn't care     You will find your group eventually  Things change all the time  But sometimes the beginning can be very daunting and scary  There definitely are masculine gay guys out there  And although not all of your current friends will accept this of you  you might be surprised who will  And if you think about it  the ones who aren't accepting you aren't really your true friends anyway  It's really difficult to have conditional friendships  That's not to say they should be entirely unconditional  but general acceptance is just the base   So just wait to see what happens  One way to look at this is you have discovered a really important aspect of yourself  and now your life is about to become better as things change to fit this  Good luck  I hear you friend   You may feel it is normal to draw the conclusions you have about your own self worth  simply based on relating your own circumstances to your observations of the lives of those around you  But I can almost guarantee you  that every other person you have met is prone to suffering  and suffers in different ways  Some people gain a lot at first  only to begin to lose it later  death of a spouse  a child  a parent  their fortune  their own health  etc   and suffer  Some people start with little  only to become stronger and gain more  Suffering is an inherent part of being human  and none of us can avoid it happening at some point in our lives  Take solace in the fact that although your situation may feel unique to you  the visceral emotions and suffering you feel is universal to being human  And likewise  there are countless  COUNTLESS of others who are going through the near exact situation as you  many who may even be in more dire straits  Some of these people have gone on to be very successful  positive people  Never feel that this is it  because it is not   Some people suffer immensely over the most trivial of things  other will suffer the same due to life threatening illnesses  lives of abuse  torture  poverty  and a host of other reasons  Ultimately  that suffering is the same emotion  perhaps expressed in different magnitudes and different lengths    Ending this is not the answer  The strongest people are those who have found many obstacles in their lives  because it's only when you suffer that you can go your furthest    There is a path to happiness  even for those in the darkest places for the longest of times  It comes with really examining the nature of what you think to be true based on the attachments we all have as a result of a western  media driven society    What has helped me as a first step from getting out of the bottom was to delve deeper into the reasons I was feeling the way I was  the root causes of those feelings  and ultimately  if those feelings really had any basis in reality  Were the aspects of myself that I could change  Are these things that I value truly valuable  Clearly  people who experience those things I value suffer just the same  in different ways   Sorry if I jumped around with my thoughts a lot  but I wanted to throw out as many different little tidbits that I could  I have found a lot of help over at  r buddhism  and I definitely know it's not everyone's cup of tea  especially coming from a western perspective  It was a lot for me to digest at first and I had a lot of doubts  but with practice I learned to minimize my suffering  and not to identify so much with the things that I believed to be true about myself  They are thoughts after all  and aren't real things  They come and go  just like clouds  Again  I'm not one to endorse a philosophy or religion on others  but it has helped me  But I can assure you  there is always a path to becoming a stronger  happier person    That's an interesting New Year's resolution No  because that would mean my parents would know  because I'm not old enough to go to one myself  I have one  but I can't tell him about it until I turn 18  If he knew anything about this he would tell my family  and I just can't let this happen  It feels nice talking about this here  so I'm sure things will get even better after I turn 18  Definitely talk to your GP  but try getting to A E tonight  I know Australia has private insurance too  but OD and overnight observation  should  both be covered by your  EHIC card  http   www nhs uk NHSEngland Healthcareabroad countryguide NonEEAcountries Pages Non EEAcountries aspx  if your from the UK   If your visa is going to expire it really does limit your options  Do you like it where you are at the moment  Have you tried getting it extended    While it can often seem like it at the time  it's quite rare you have no options  If you manage to secure a temporary job to pay the bills while you meet new people and settle in  To get you back on your feet when you feel up to it  Have you lost contact with your whole family  That's good to hear  We're here if you need support   Maybe it wouldn't be as bad as you think if they know  You could get a hamster or a cat even  Also I don't know where you live but in my region the laws have changed so that landlords can't refuse people with pets  Especially if it helps with your health  Anyways  that's a tangent    I have to say you've been through a lot  Reaching out to professionals  I assume trying meds and therapy  exercise and self help  And people have somehow let you down  Or maybe nothings worked  But you're here posting on Reddit  You've got strangers desperately trying to convince you that maybe there's another option  Just maybe  I know that if I knew you or saw you in real life I would be there  checking in everyday  I do that already with a friend of mine  We both have suicidal thoughts  There are others in your position  You just have to find them  I really think what people like us need is support groups  A group in real life where we can talk about our thoughts  and then go running and remember what it feels like to be alive  What do you think about that   something similar happened to me these days i have never been close with anyone not to mention having a girlfriend and so on  social anxiety etc   met this girl became really good friends realized thats the first person that i feel comfortable with and i actually like and for the first time ever i decided to give it a try  i got closer than friends for a bit but she decided that she doesnt like me in that way and and thats very easy for me to understand and accept  but made me think about suicide as i did for years before that The only thing that is stopping me is that i have no where to give my dog and i really love her and i want her to have a good life   literally no friends almost no family no one ever looks for me  But i sort of accepted things as they are even tho i feel horrible every single day   my point is that even if you dont have anything you can still dream that one day things will sort out and that alone can keep you going   atleast it works for me so far because as i said i have nothing else that keeps me in the world besides the dog  So try to hang on for as much as you can and as they say things will slowly start to get better  atleast thats my plan   dont know i might go any day now but ill try to hold on for a bit more   good luck and give it a few more chances   Totally  You are still a person  with individuality when you are gay  There is no hivemind or anything that dictates what you can and can't do  Just be yourself  I might not be able to understand exactly  but I can relate  I lost my husband three years ago   Some people might be able to be happy on their memories  but for me  that's like telling a starving person to be happy remembering eating food  A one way relationship only takes me so far  sitting on the couch alone and remembering going out with my husband for the evening just doesn't quite do it when the rest of the world is moving on without me   I know my husband wouldn't want me to give up  but then my husband wouldn't have wanted me to be alone in my thirties  I'm sorry I can't offer any good advice  but I just wanted to let you know I can relate to how you might be feeling  And for what it's worth  I'm still around three years out  for whatever reason  I was a daily cutter in my teen years and into my early twenties   I've mostly managed to stop  with only a handful of slips in the past 5 years   I had  still sometimes do have  severe depression  which mostly came out in irritability and explosive rage  which I took out on myself  But cutting is noticeable  it leaves scars  people notice   So instead I would punch walls  punch my head and legs  hit my head on walls   It took me a long time to learn how to control it     A punching bag could definitely help   You need something that isn't going to cause you more pain  and you need to let that anger out in a healthier way   I also personally liked the elastic band on the wrist tactic as well   When you start to get into those urges  you just snap the elastic on your wrist which creates pain  and leaves no scars bruising   I would go and sit in my dark quiet bedroom when the anger came and ping the thing for an hour  until I calmed down   It took a lot of self control  because it's not nearly as satisfying as that feeling you get when you're physically hurting yourself   But I also took that time to reflect on how irrational I was being  over the stupid thing that brought me to that rage in the first place     I've also seen psychologists  and have been on anti depressant anti anxiety medication for the past five years  which did wonders for me   Talk therapy also really helped me   I'm not saying that you need to do all or any of these things  but this is how I managed to deal with my issues   Self harm is an addiction   It's like any other addiction   I still have bad days   I think about cutting when things don't go right   It's possible to stop on your own  but asking for professional help  as hard as it is  could make all the difference in the world for your life   I really hope things get better for you    I had things in life  but I lost every single one of them  I can't have this kind of hope anymore  it's like I already lost my innocence  I hope things go better to you Living for yourself is Not selfish  there is nothing selfish about recognizing your own self worth and having value in it and making it a priority  well mine is just foolish hope because im only 21 i guess   "I need to talk to you about something" Is sufficient to start the conversation  She cares about and will listen  If you love your wife and don't want her to suffer  she needs to know how you're feeling  You can try to get help  assess your safety and options  Bringing her in is the best thing you can do  You are not alone   I think you matter  Think about how you're feeling  and imagine someone else feeling that way  I see a latina  I coincidentally see from your username that you're latina  and think about how she's so pretty and im not and I'm worthless  I am not making this up  this is a huge insecurity of mine leading to suicidal thoughts    You matter  Someone is looking at you and wishing they were you  through your looks  actions  personality  You just don't know it   this was me last night haha  luckily I didn't do it but I was scared I was going to   27 here and going through the darkest time of my life  I can relate   I hope your keeping safe and are otherwise still functional given the circumstances    If you need a chat or to vent  drop me a PM  I'm GMT and will get back to you asap if you chose to  Take care  Please  I'm sorry to hear that    breakups are so difficult  especially if you are struggling with your own issues  The reality is that you don't want to be with someone who doesn't want to be with you  You are deserving of someone who chooses you  Maybe it'll be your ex  maybe it'll be another person  It's an uncertainty that is hard to deal with but the benefits of being with someone who loves you for you are so rewarding  Yet you are your own person  It may seem like you need someone to survive but you don't  You have the inner strength  You will always have you  no matter who comes or goes   Why are you feeling this way  We are here for you   You might be experiencing derealization  where the world doesn't feel real  It is a type of detachment  dissociation  Are you currently getting any help  That's a shit load of things going on all at one time  If it wasn't bad enough that you feel pretty crappy  then all that stuff happens on top  I'm sorry to hear that you're not well  I hear lupus isn't fun to cope with  and having instablity in home and career can't be helping you  What are you applying to go back and study at school  It sounds like maybe you'd started to figure out a way out of your situation  but life has thrown some crap your way  Please dont leave so soon  What are you going to fulfill  Stick it out man  i know how it is to be the "happy go lucky" guy who actually is sad as fuck   its no fun  i find solace in helping others out though  makes me feel like i have purpose  you just gotta find what gives you purpose  try new things you never know what may come of it Those are some pretty big questions  I guess it depends on your definition of "help oneself"  I'm not sure death really meets that criteria  because your Self stops existing when you die  So  it probably doesn't help you as such  other than stopping any pain  along with stopping any chance of that pain allieviating by other means   I guess I am more interested in what is going on for you which has brought you to feel like suicide is a serious consideration  If you want to vent  we're here to listen  Hey  Im sorry to hear about your situation  I really am  Im in a similar boat and can relate    Getting a job really helped secure my thoughts and gave me peace of mind while im paying things off  I know it can be difficult to see the light at the end of the tunnel  but keep pushing to find a job  And never give up on that  Im sure that will help solve the issue  Good luck  I will keep you in my prayers    Larry I'm exactly the same as you  Hey Pocket witch  I'm sorry things are so bad  Feeling like a burden on the people who you love the most is like torture  It's such a hard place to be in  because you can't really turn to the people you need without feeling even worse  Can you tell us more why you feel you are a burden  Has anything specific happened recently  I had told him before that I was suicidal and depressed  And he knows I self harm  So I was hoping he would realize I was feeling really low I'm going to pm you Hahaha this morning I just wanted to make a burn  but I were to lazy and didn't do it  is weird how it becomes a task  Look i dont know what youve been through and i dont know how long youve felt this way  i really dont  want you to kill yourself because that just fixes nothing  but if you actually do  please leave a note  for one it rules out any allegations of foul play in a death and secondly it can show people what you've gone through and maybe even help prevent others from suffering the same way  now just because you write a note doesn'tmean you are allowed to kill yourself  just do it if you decide to end it which you definitely should not  Tl dr don't kill yourself but if you ultimately do  leave a note I care about you  I might not know you  and I probably don't count because I am just a bunch of 1s and 0s on the Internet  but I still care  I wish things were better for you  I wish I had a magic wand which I could wave which would take all your pain away and make you be able to live the life you want  No one deserves to feel like this  If you want to talk more  we are here to listen  for what it is worth  i'm in a lot of financial difficulty  i was unemployed for a year  i'm trying to provide care  with his fam's help  to my fiance who has a chronic illness he's coming out of  my mentally ill mom JUST got herself in a better place living out of the country  and the only other family i have is states away    they already let me stay with them for several months to get treatment for my depression and i thought it helped but i feel worse than ever  i only just got health insurance now and i don't qualify for FMLA so i can't go on leave or disability and i don't really have anyone to ask for for help    they've either tried or they have other things going on that are just more pressing and i'm beginning to feel at this point that my existence is more of a burden than a help to people   most of the day is so painful  i lost most of my friends recently because they turned out to be not so great so my support system besides my fiance is small and not close by  i basically live for my fiance now but i really am thinking his life would be better without me ultimately   my real fear now is if i do attempt what happens if i fail  how much worse will that make my life  his life  my loved ones lives  what possible solution is there  i can't afford to take time off work to go inpatient and i just started this job only a few months ago  i have no idea how i'd suddenly get a new one after treatment esp without the insurance my job provides  You sound pretty convinced that life is a competition or a race  Competing against time and peers for jobs  money  a certain type of woman  Imagine for a second that life is not a competition  that success is not measured by your BMI or how many people you've slept with    You are seeing others' highlight reel  Maybe a young engineer hates their job and wants to be a photographer  Maybe their wife who is skinny is a horrible person  Maybe their first love was a curvy woman who made them happy and they'd kill to be with that woman again    People may judge you on your outward appearance or behaviour  and you know how wrong that is  Don't fall into the same trap  What you see is not what may be true    People have second careers  people go to med school at 30 years of age  people find new passions at 80  Success is not a linear path  Find what makes you happy and fulfilled   Thank you  this helps That sounds so isolating  though if your friends weren't so great then I am glad they are no longer part of your life  It might mean feeling alone in the short term  but that's way better than having people in your life who aren't kind to you  How much does your fiance know  Does he know how unhappy you are  or do you try to protect him by keeping it to yourself  Most likely they'll immediately think you're suicidal  thats the hardest thing for people to understand  that you cut not cause you want to die but because you want to live I'm glad he was found  hey u can message me here if u wanna talk im on here 24 7 so i can speak whenever   There's really not much to go on that list I don't mean to be a critic or anything  but this may help you  and others  in future instances   There are many people on this planet who haven't yet realized what they are talented in  or may not have developed it to the level where they think that they are good at it    Also  people who are depressed  specially who might are overcoming suicidal tendencies  generally have a difficulty enjoying things  It is almost quite literally impossible to enjoy something in the emotional state of depression   So  I am not a professional  but it is my personal opinion that asking a person who is severely depressed  as in very sad for a rather long time  to think of what they are good at or what they enjoy  is a rather bad idea because they might not be able to consciously think of anything    Because of the emotional state of severe sadness which they are in  they might be unable to feel as though they have anything worth writing  The feeling caused by not being able to write anything in such a state could  possibly  only worsen the situation by making them feel worse about themselves   I think that your intention is nice  and your suggestion could possibly be useful for people who are depressed  but not suicidal  It is my personal opinion that recommending such  seemingly  harmless self help techniques could cause undesired outcomes in people who are in a delicate  or rather volatile  state of emotions   That's just my opinion  I wasn't certain myself for a long time  Turns out it was stress and it was the only way that made me feel better  Some of us can't 'move on'  depending on our pasts we're all different  I realized when I started cutting that I had always been a self harmer  pulling my hair  hitting my head  digging my nails into my palms  biting my lip until it bled  starving myself or overeating  Thankfully I never abused drugs or alcohol  but yeah it was mostly to 'feel' something  the adrenaline helped me to cope with what I was or wasn't feeling at the time  gave me something else to focus on  I was messaging this guy earlier and he's stopped replying since he posted this  I don't know how to contact him   You can always make up a story that makes them feel SUPER bad for asking "rabid dog"  "my  enter person here  used to think it was funny     " then trail off and stare into the distance   Or just say "f you that's what happened" They should know better  but I suppose maybe he was trying to make sure you weren't being abused  Just because you're masculine doesn't mean you're any less gay  Plenty of gay guys are masculine  it's not just limited to feminine behaviour  like TV shows  Trying to be optimistic about it  maybe your friends are only 'homophobic' because they've simply never had any sort of experience with talking to a gay person  Obviously if they're the kind to shoot a gay guy  then don't mention it to them   Like Dreamer said  counselling would be a good idea  It might help you to get past this issue and accept yourself  he knows i struggle with mental illness and is incredibly incredibly supportive  he reaches out to doctors for me and tries to help me as much as he can but dealing with his own health issues is a lot for him and i am definitely trying to protect him by keeping the severity to myself    no good can come from me putting that all on him  i'd reach back out to my other fam but i'm not sure what they can do as they are far away  i just feel lonely and at the end of my rope and i don't think i can do this anymore  my fiance deserves to be with someone more stable than me who can make him happy and and who can take better care of him  and my family deserves to not have to constantly worry if i'm going to call or not    my biggest fear honestly is that if i attempt i'll fail and then what  Wait what  I know a ton of gay guys that are outdoorsman  Being gay doesn't make you a woman  dude  You're still a man  You're just a man who happens to like men  Which makes you the manliest man to ever manifest on this mantle   Live your life as normal and you'll eventually find a man  like yourself  who likes you  Yeah  that sounds about right  It's just become a natural response to just immediately dismiss any compliment someone has  After being on this subreddit for a while you really hit the nail on the head though  it's kinda weird to hear it  and I'm sorry you have to deal with that  I know it's not easy  Well I guess like you said there is the option that you might lose your job and upset your family  I guess there is another version where you don't fail  There is a version where things stay the same  I guess there are multiple versions  but you can't predict which one would happen    I'm glad that your fiance is supportive for you  and I totally get that you want to protect him  it just shows how much you care and value him that you would give your life up to try and make his easier  If you did tell him that you were going to do this  what do you think he would say  He cares about her so much  Me  Not so much   I'm sorry to hear all of the unfair things happening to you right now  I hope you know being married and doing what you're doing you have gotten so far    Why give up now   You have things I only dream of having to worry about  I hope you'll see that she isn't worth it  I know you may be heartbroken  and living while hurting and in despair isn't fun I know     but if you managed to get all of this what about trying again and finding something better   "I have no gay friends cause I don't fucking fit in with them"  This caught my eye and I wanted to offer a suggestion  Maybe you feel you don't fit in with gay people because you are only seeing the "feminine" gay stereotype    What I'm saying is this  There are gay people all around you that you would never guess are gay just like you  because they don't fit that stereotype  I bet if you found some gay people with your common interests you would be very surprised   On another hand I'm very sorry you feel this way  I'm not gay but I have autism and I feel like I can't relate to much of anyone around me either  I've never had a gf and not many friends  It really sucks OP      I'm sorry you are in this situation  But keep us updated  You are always welcome to reach out to me    Hey  it's my area of expertise   Bleach is actually a pretty safe choice compared to other chemcials around your house  as far a skin contact go  To care for bleach burns you should just run it under water for 15 mins or so  this partially is to prevent it on getting on anything  but after a rinse be sure to use some sort of moisturizer to make the skin softer  as the outer most layer will be damaged   There is most likely no need to see a doctor  but if you notice strange color fluids not clear or yellowish  draining from the wound  a fowl smell  the wound still hurting after a long time  or if you run a fever then you should see a doctor about possible infection   If you want to read more on bleach here is the MSDS  Material Safety Data Sheet  which is used to asses how dangerous a chemical is   http   www sciencelab com msds php msdsId 9925000 I am a little suicidal though  But cutting is not the way I would do it I am in the same situation and I understand you  Every day I want to kill myself  In the end we all live for something  I'm sure you'll improve  I wish you the best  Original  like on the ps2 Better Yay  Thanks  I wasn't sure about what to apply on it because I thought I could do more damage  I googled it but I could't find concise information  also the information were always about accidental contact with bleach   Thank you     Not on ps2  but I used to play battlefront 2 on pc  I don't play them anymore  but when I was about 6 or 7  I played the medal of honor games  What MSDS considers "Accidental" is what normal people would call "A bath" so it's usually my go to guide  I'm not good enough for anything so I doubt it  Nothing good even exists    it's always bad bad bad  Anything good lasts like 3 seconds before getting ruined  and I don't get happy when good things happen because they get ruined 100  of the time    I'm afraid of talking to people now because my 'friends' like to talk about themselves but when I need to share nobody really cares    I get what you're trying to say but   I'm too defeated  It won't matter if the world loses one more person Thanks  man  Do you cut cause you're suicidal though  Thanks for your words  I'm trying to quit being such a little bitch about it   Great to hear Some people seem to need a hammer to the head before they understand what seems clear to you  I snap a thick rubber band around my inner elbow instead  carry a rubberband   The hardest thing for me to do was focus on my muscles and relax them  Also i absolutely have to keep my hands busy at all times  Are you always attracted to the girls you ask out  And you don't mind being Friend Zoned does that basically mean that you try to ask these girls out on a date as an expressed interest then they decline  and I really hope politely  you ask them to be friends  which could be a  slightly uncomfortable position to be in  Hence why they rudelt  Have you tried finding a girl that you have no interest in  and talking to her get to know her  And you are good enough if not better  sometimes people do things when they have no idea what to do and it can be very rude  Trust me man I know it's not you  try not to over think it too much I have     I was addicted for years  In March  I'll be 4 years clean  I know it sounds cliche  but it really will get better and there is so much freedom in that   The first few months are the hardest  I think  As you replace self harm with healthier coping habits it'll slowly but surely be manageable   If you wanna talk about it  what exactly is making you feel like crap  Is it more physical  or emotional mental  Feel free to PM me if you'd rather  Nah Boo  you aren't incapable you're just in a new era of distractibility  much like the previous commenter said  internet culture gives faster rewards  As for the over due homework  have you tried taking a little at a time to help kinda take that mountain down  And from when I was in high school if your in high school  it really didn't matter  at least in America  for colleges what grades you got from all the way up to your second year of high school  The last two years are the most important and if you're in college  just remember "C's get Degrees " I'm kidding but don't stress  you got this but also remember take on your homework one bit at a time maybe a subject a day type thing  Never heard of that book before  may I ask why you are looking into it  You should come back and help others when you have the time  Since you have first hand experience  surely you'd be able to relate to most better than some of us  For development why not make a game of your anxieties  like the bacterial growth have infested the mind and only you  the hero can stop them from entering others mind  As for the relationship aspect I wouldn't worry too much about that  For me  I've learned that I need to discover myself before I discover someone else im sorry you're feeling down in the dumps but you can beat this  Just try to explore safely though What's the degree in  If you don't mind me asking  Is it something you can take with you to another city  state or country  Why  Sweetie no  you're a lot More valuable than what you give yourself credit for  I'm sorry you've gone through such a horrific event that you truly didn't deserve  have you reported it to the police  As for sitting alone at lunch I'm sorry about that but I think people don't know how to act when seeing people by themselves unfortunately  maybe try something to let them know you're available to chat with them like a little sign that says "Free Seat  let's chat"  It's always a conversation starter as you start a new school  Just remember you've gone through a lot and that's made you a lot more stronger than you realize  I know it doesn't feel that way but trust me you are  And I started to feel   "How can you even think of killing yourself  I mean isn't it so stupid  I mean look at all the people up there on the screen  you know  they're real funny  and what if the worst is true  What if there's no God and you only go around once and that's it  Well  you know  don't you wanna be part of the experience  You know  what the hell it's not all a drag  And I'm thinking to myself  Jeez  I should stop ruining my life searching for answers I'm never gonna get  and just enjoy it while it lasts  And  you know  after who knows  I mean  you know  maybe there is something  nobody really knows  I know maybe is a very slim reed to hang your whole life on  but that's the best we have  And then I started to sit back  and I actually began to enjoy myself " Because I relate to some of the things you're feeling and I remember how awful it is to feel like that  Because I believe in some weird way we are all slightly connected and there are an infinite number of possible things which can happen because of the way people relate to each other  When we lose someone  thats a trillion lost possibilities  We lose all the things you could have become  or all the connections you could have made  Because you're a human being and that makes you valuable in my book   Thanks for the reply  Path of Exile kinda is that kind of game  The world is overrun by all kinds of evil creatures who you could say are bacteria trying to infect the world and your hero goes out to destroy the source of the problem  Maybe that's what i'm already subconsciously doing and maybe i should focus on it more  Are there any parts in specific you'd recommend me to discover myself more on  I feel completely stuck  am very bored and any kind of goal would help at the moment  Just listing some things i could try would help a lot  Maybe the right idea at the moment is to simply try and take it easy at the moment or maybe discover new things  Maybe i've overworked myself with development and need to take a break  Someone supportive would help most at the moment  Nothing else really matters at the moment  I don't even know what else i like  I've reached the point where this doesn't matter anymore so why would anything else    Could you please add more details   I'm in the same boat     life sucks so bad    I don't really know what I'm going to do  but I've made an attempt before and it didn't work  All it did was scar me and made things worst      I'm pretty much hopeless right now    just trying to get on the right track   i did end up just going to sleep   i'm not currently on any meds  I quit taking them before i got the chance to talk to my doctor  Bad bad bad idea  never recommend it to anyone  the withdrawals were terrible   i always end up finding likeminded people when i try to meet new people  which doesn't always do so much harm  i mean my boyfriend and i are practically one in the same and it's pretty good bc we understand each other   he's not the problem in the relationship  and i realize that i'm not either  it just felt really shitty   i hate going to my therapist  i've only ever had one that was good  and i had to leave her behind bc she was a therapist at one of my programs   Ignore him  He's a troll  Its alright    big hugs  Im really happy for you    hope to find you on a more interesting sub haha I can relate  Very tough dealing with mental health and being asocial to meet social expectations      You are seeing others' highlight reel  Maybe a young engineer hates their job and wants to be a photographer  Maybe their wife who is skinny is a horrible person  Maybe their first love was a curvy woman who made them happy and they'd kill to be with that woman again    You are right in that a lot of people hate their jobs but are too afraid to change and a lot of young couples marry because of a pregnancy  On the other hand  this sounds a lot like the guys who look at a muscular guy and think "guy has no game" or "he must be stupid" to feel better about themselves     Heya sorry to hear you're in a similiar situation  i'm gonna try a few different things this year i wouldn't normally do  see if that changes anything  Here's hoping you find the strength to get up and try again too    Ikr  it can get pretty draining  all i can really suggest is to keep on keeping on  try differerent things and see what works and what doesn't  if after all being said and done  can't say you didn't at least try    I made changes in the past yr    I went back to school new city   new part time job    I have no friends   always been on the quiet side   I tried social gathering  I have started  Conversations   nothing comes of it    I am on antidepressants  sleeping pill   I exercise   I will be graduating in April    it is hard being alone and isolated  I feel like this most of my life   all I really want is friends     it is not happening     I have ran out of hope and fight    I am sorry to admit it however it is true   something bad happens   it may take me over the edge   You aren't being a little bitch  These kind of problems are very real and can be heart wrenching  I myself have been bullied by two of my so called 'friends' which  started when I was twelve  I also have a form of autism  so it completely wrecked me up  And two years later  when I tried opening up again  I got bullied  Again  On top of that all I also got kicked  out of college once  so that sucks   So yeah  I can relate quite a bit to your problems  However  they are  not  the end of the world  I now study physics  and have a ton of good friends and even finished an internship overseas   It's impossible to say that it will be 'worth it' for you  After all  bad luck is a thing in this world  But it got better for me  And hopefully  it will for you as well  Well you could always start small like I don't know Favorite food or color  if you have a little expensive cashola maybe bathbombing and soaking in the tub and meditate see where your mind takes you as an observer what does it focus on  Don't force just let it  do it thing hope that helps  I think you're at a burnout take some time refresh yourself type thing  Nah man  there's nothing wrong with you  But what do you mean people don't take you seriously  If you don't mind me asking  Plus shortness isn't bad man   Okay  thanks  That sounds like something i could do  I'll try and find something that will help me refresh  Wow  that is awesome and beautiful   I am kinda thinking the same way  do what I have to do to make sure I'm ok   Happy I would love but for now  I will take ok  Don't laff and I'm being totally serious   I think it was like 2 months ago  I heard on tv that some scientists think they found the gene that causes aging in rats and were able to turn it off or something where the rats live a whole lot longer with no bad side effects Something like in 10 or 15 years they want to try tests on people  I am making some decisions that will change things for me  not good but not bad  just change things  I thought the woman here liked me  but I was wrong   Late last night  I heard her on the phone saying she needs to talk to her mother to find out how much longer I have to stay here and that she can't take it much more   Oh well  I have something planned for thursday  so I may just take off that day or wait until friday and be gone   By then  nothing will really matter any way  I don't know the answer to that  I just wanted you to know that there's a random stranger out here who cares about you  So sorry about your friend  That happens to me too  "you don't seem sad"  Please don't take offence to what she said  some people are oblivious to their surroundings  it's not your fault   I'm here to listen to your story   Well first off  suicide isn't the only way to solve your problem  I think right now you're in an emotionally charged state where rash decisions seem smart but I think what you need to do is sleep for a bit and tell yourself you're not in a rational state of mind and every thing your feeling is this monster that doesn't want you to succeed please let us know what's going on and that way somebody can help  If the thoughts too severe go to the ER and tell them you want to kill yourself  I believe they can keep you there for a bit   Keep us post I know it doesn't feel like it  but at 21  you have the world by the balls   Take some time for yourself   Go away for awhile  whatever away your capable of  and for however long you're capable   Make a plan    give yourself some room for error   Have a back up plan  and a back up to a back up   Live for you  not anyone else   You alone decide how your life is gonna turn out   Grab your life by the ass  tell that mother fucker how it's gonna be  and go out and do the things that make YOU happy     I personally  have always had the dream of living on a beach  where the weather is great year round  with a meaningless job  making just enough to be able to enjoy myself and do what I want   Go easy friend   Let everything slow down  and make yourself some sort of plan that will make you happy  Thank you for caring  My other friends told me that trait is rare and nice to have as well  But  I mean  I wouldn't have to hurt if I wasn't like this  I know being an asshole is never good  but at least they don't get hurt   I will try to find something other than video games to help ease myself  I agree wholeheartedly with that  Mental health should be a priority  Take care as well  cakerton  Thank you for caring   Your wife is treating you like shit because she knows she can get away with it and knows you will let her because of your low self esteem  If divorce is not an option for you then there are some things you can take control of  for example you can change where your pay goes  if you create accounts which are not shared and ensure that she has no access to your pay   Confrontation is something that you may not be so good at or she may be better at than you  So my suggestion to you is to plan a sit down at the dinning room table and lay out exactly which bills she will pay with her income  Inform her you will not pay for her phone or car etc and that if she wants stuff like electricity then she needs to contribute like an adult  Lay it out  be fair  logical and then end the discussion  don't let her try to convince you otherwise  lay it out  because you have control over your pay now she will be forced to use her money  If she doesn't sell her car and cancel her phone  she can't talk to other men after that   Exercise  this is SUPER hard if you are depressed  I hate it when people just tell you "to get out there and just do it"  Depression just fucking saps your energy  Start by walking  2kms first week  4kms 2nd week  Depending on your weight maybe even running  If your kids are interested take them with you  walk to a park and spend quality time  If you do this straight after work you will also through time learn to unwind quickly after work which is great for stress  Eventually maybe even the gym and you can be one of those guys who says "DO YOU EVEN LIFT BRO"  jokes   but seriously weights are awesome for testosterone   Change eating habits  also SUPER FUCKING HARD if you are depressed  Fast food releases endorphins makes you feel a little better try cooking a little and make small changes at first and work towards it  Meat and veg salad is the simplest way to eat healthy as long as you avoid sugary oily salad dressings and potato carbs    From what you are saying you feel like your life is spiralling out of control  my wife felt like this a while back  I sat down and though long and hard about it and came to this conclusion  Don't spend too much time thinking worrying about the things you can't control and focus on the things you can no matter how small they are  If your wife is not going to treat you with respect then you need to treat yourself with respect  damn it    It's so hard  I struggle day to day with it  I also have low shitty self esteem but lately exercise and diet changes have made such a difference  I can't recommend it more  The financial problems are a whole other kettle of fish and you basically need plan the conversation  put your foot down and end the conversation  Try to work out the percentage of the house you have paid off in case it comes to the worst but in all honesty you deserve better mate  you are willing to slave at a shitty job to support a family then you deserve a woman who will uplift you and do everything within her power to make you feel like a man  make you feel masculine like the provider you are   Because that is what you are  you have stuck out this time  you have slaved away to provide for the kids  you have fought for this family  for you relationship  You are doing what you should be sacrificing for the family  all you want is the truth but she won't respect you unless your demeanour demands it and that may take time   I would say for now focus on yourself  focus on your kids because it sounds like she is getting attention from other places  You can't change that and like I said before focus on what you can change  get angry  get angry at yourself and focus that on self improvement not destructive behaviour   Love conquers all brother  your kids need you  too many grow up without fathers  This current young generation is almost defined by it's lack of masculinity or is demonization of it  The world NEEDS men  men that are willing to sacrifice for their children and fight for them  build that relationship because in your post I see your wife mentioned constantly but your kids mentioned once and that was in reference to something she did with them  Make sure you take control of those finances ASAP it will lighten the load and reduce your stress but also let her know that you are willing to take control when it matters   As per usual feel free to ignore this but brother self respect is the key here  Loving yourself doesn't mean you have to be a narcissist  you need to respect yourself  unslouch your shoulders  this actually makes a difference btw  it's weird but true  and take small steps towards change  one at a time not all at once    Also change diet before exercise if you aim to lose weight you will see progress quicker  seeing progress brings a sense of achievement and motivation the same will apply to how far fast you can walk run   especially if you use a liquid diet where you replace breakfast and lunch with a meal replacement shake and eat a healthy dinner  this is handy because you can do the shakes before and at work and eat dinner with the family so it won't effect that social aspect   Exercise will get those endorphins and testosterone up though    This world needs men like you willing to sacrifice and stick things out  I know I have said this a few times already but that's because it's really important  Focus on that   Peace and Love  Suffering from anxiety is a terrible thing  and I understand the panic and fear that comes from a change to your plans  however begnin  It is great that your parents are aware  supporting  and willing to work around this  even if it doesn't seem like that's what they are doing   However have you considered speaking to them about how you feel bad about the reduced role they give you  that your grateful  but feel shit about forcing them to work around your anxiety  From the sound of it they sound like they would understand  and it might help   Have you had your anxiety professionally diagnosed  Doing so can unlock access to so many help programmes  from CBT  to therapy groups to meds  whatever might work for you  I will not advocate for getting any specific help  I don't know you or your situation well enough to do so  But the do  and if you haven't should look at done of the other options you might not have had the opportunity to try    I'm interested  what trade are you learning  Will you get to gradually slip into socialising  like with a small group  or will you meet many new people  Do you enjoy it at the moment    not in a bad way I hope  It's quite famous  I think it would be an interesting read  It's about the right to a peaceful death when terminally ill   Please calm down  If you're going to approach him on this  which I definitely think you should  you need to calm down  I came here earlier today planning on making my own post on why I should kill myself  but halfway through typing I went against my better judgement and talked to a friend  I'm glad I did    He most likely won't want to talk about it  but please  please talk to him about it  Tell him the entirety of how you found out  tell him how it makes you feel  tell him everything  What helped me was knowing that I still had the option of killing myself  Let him know that it's his decision  Let him know that you care about him  Let him know that at least you want see him to say goodbye before he goes    I don't know if this worked exclusively for me  but it really did work for me today  The situation you're in doesn't sound like you need to rush  so read other responses and think through how to approach him on this  I'm glad that you care about him enough to seek out help   What kind of debt  I don't actually come here at all and I only ended up here now as someone linked this subreddit on a comment  decided to click on your post to get a feeling of this sub   On the matter at hand  I think it's just a matter of perspective  What I get from your post is that you are only seeing the negative things in your life  even a possible solution to your problem  divorce  pops as another series of issues first and foremost in your mind    You gotta think of the positives  For example  imagine you are in a desert  you're sweating and thirsty as hell  there are two main line of thoughts one can have   1  This really sucks  I can't do this anymore  2  How nice it will be to finally drink water and rest after I'm through this    This is your life now  you're on a big desert and you can't see a way out  Focus on the water that's coming to you after you fix things up  I don't know your life  nor exactly what you go through daily  but find something to focus on  create an object  and work toward it  Divorce will be harsh  but if her cellphone is indeed a big pool of proofs  this will help the process a bit   Don't give up    I reckon say it to your doctor  I would actually think that they would be more equipped than a CBT therapist as they would cover a lot more and aren't as specialised  Good to know that you will at least tell a professional  well done    Divorce that bitch  If you like your job  keep it  if not  find something you enjoy  Personally  i'm in high school and pretty sure I want to be a pilot but it would be a similar life style so I might turn around and go back to college for computer engineering  whats your passion       Take that vacation  but come back please  Life is important and fragile  but more importantly it is weird  awesome  and you are a part of it  So do your favorite things and try to relax  If that doesn't work  sit in a quiet place on a hilltop and do absolutely nothing for an hour or 5  maybe even a whole day if thats what it takes to attune yourself  That's quite heavy  are you terminally ill yourself  Are there any shelters for teens where you live  I totally get if you don't want to go to one  that's okay too  Also  being on your own you obviously are going to need money  do you currently have a job  If not  I could help you come up with some ways to make money  You should try and save up  and get some work experience too so when you are 18 you can get a good paying job and hopefully have enough to live on your own   Nothing to feel embarrassed about  glad you got some help  Don't ever feel embarrassed for reaching out in a time of need  You don't need to prove a damn thing  Your friend might not really be a friend at all  We are here for you  What's up  Not in a bad way  Maybe to help others    Well balance can be tough to attain    "just right" not too much one way and not too much the other way    I suppose if you were to make an error  would you rather be mine and hurt or an asshole    In between is a good balance where sometimes you are hurt  other times you are tough   I'm gonna assume this is the main account of the throwaway  so you're more likely to see the message   I'm glad your attempt failed  I'm sure that whoever you had plans with  they'll be glad that your attempt failed  too  If they want to make plans with you  they want you around  and want to be your friend  I understand  I seriously love the fact you took time of your life to answer me  it's beautiful  I love you  but that doesn't change anything    i have same feeling and i am 29 years old too  some how it seems everything around is passing by leaving me alone  its been years since i laughed with heart  but i hope one day i can be happy again and i continue to live one day at a time  not knowing how long i can do it but thinking about my death always make me clam and its scares me even more   its been already more than an year but i will try one more day Are you still seeing your therapist  It might not feel like it's helping  but maybe you could tell them how bad things have become  One last ditch attempt to find another solution   Honestly this is the most helpful thing anyone has said in a while  This is exactly how I feel   People say "  wouldn't want you to feel like this" but I also don't think   would want me to be just turned twenty two and widowed    Fuck  man    I know how you feel it is a sucky feeling and I'm so sorry that you have to deal with that but you can beat this I know the feeling of the low self esteem I'm like the king of it haha but I've learned to offhandedly give myself compliments even if it's in a joking manner things like I may be fat but I got that nice minority booty eeeyyyyy as for the parents thing I think they wanted to help but they don't realize the mistake they made it happens there's no instruction manual for parenting it's unfortunate but I think another thing that you and I have so much in common is we're afraid that we lack  control I think we're trying to figure out what we can and can't and it just becomes too much and I get you I really do it's part of life unfortunately but fortunately sometimes it leads to beautiful things happening life is scary man but it can be beautiful as for the whole scenario of you being in a slump for your job is there a way you can maybe search out of City  out of state  And as for the whole house and spouse with the 14 children and white picket fence if that's not your interest you don't have to have that it's okay and if you do want it just start small go out on a date enjoy yourself don't try to rush anything just have fun you're still young you have plenty of time to figure yourself out There's a quote that always helps me out      "For what its worth  its never too late or  in my case  too early to be whoever you want to be  Theres no time limit  stop whenever you want  You can change or stay the same  there are no rules to this thing  We can make the best or the worst of it  I hope you make the best of it  And I hope you see things that startle you  I hope you feel things you never felt before  I hope you meet people with a different point of view  I hope you live a life youre proud of  If you find that youre not  I hope you have the courage to start all over again"  You'll beat this  it won't be easy but you will and if you ever need a shoulder to cry you can always message me    I hope you feel better and sorry for the essay Fuck that bitch  bitches aint shit but hoes and tricks  Book a flight to the other side of the world  fuck her  wait till shes asleep  pack your shit and steal all of hers  No but I'd still like to read it  I guess I'll have to wait until I have some less restrictive wifi  i hope you are alright now  i couldn't understand what you are going through from your message  what kind of thoughts you are having  if you know  the reason for getting them    please explain i will listen too you  I tried to make it my new years resolution not to but I'm too weak Hi OP  I am sorry you are going through this with your mum  it sounds like a huge thing to be dealing with on your own  Does your mum tell you that she wants to kill herself  or is this something you're getting from reading between the lines  Like i always say this peave and go somewhere else start a new life for yourself  Lifes an adventure live it  Yep so true gets your mind off it  Keeps you occupied and you know your making a diffeence  I once heard that if we invested as much into ourselves emotionally as we did to others  we would be richer for it    Came across this post randomly  Feel free to leave a message   I'm gonna say this in the least cold way possible   once you have kids  I don't think suicide is an option anymore  I understand you're going through a very rough time and I can empathize with that  having gone through similar things  But man  think about your kids  It's hard enough to lose a parent  but knowing that they offed themselves leaves an immeasurable feeling of not being good enough   I saw in another comment you said you're trying to quit being a bitch about it  You're not being a bitch at all man  The pain is real  it's deep and it's not worth fighting alone  I hope you get the help that you need  whether that be counseling  medication  or whatever  instead of taking matters into your own hands  Take it easy brother   Let me know how it works  keep me updated i can not completely understand how you feel  but i had similar situation some years ago  when i have 10 in account cant ask money from my family or friends  they live in another country  and cant even apply for job center  student and immigrant   i dint know what to eat for next days i was very depressed and angry about my life dint even know what to eat  community halls and food shelters helped me at that time  after several days of this situation i found part time job which was some better   i just want to ask 1  is it possible you asked your friends family to lend some money  2  is it difficult part time job for quick money  She told me People can't just understand  They're is no need for you to prove it  Please reach out to get help from someone who is more capable  It will often be hard for others to understand  but if you keep trying  you'll find someone  And don't forget  we're here  You can talk to us at any time  Many people here DO understand  That must've been really hard to hear  I am sorry  Does your mum have any help for her depression  like a doctor or a therapist  Just curious  how old are you  Thank you very much for your response  I accidentally deleted the original post and reposted it in this sub  I love him so very much  Yeah  I don't think he'll be down to talk about it at all  Or I'm sure he'll give me some bs about it just being an internet post  I definitely want to take some time to cool off and get my thoughts straight before talking to him about this  I know this is certainly a discussion that needs to happen   and I hope it helps him in some way  He has such a bright future  and he is loved by so many people so deeply  As someone who deals with clinical depression  I know it's hard to see how any of that matters  but man    I wish he could see  Again  thank you so very much for your reply  And I'm glad that you're still here   3 its not that strange  i feel the same too and got to know there are many like us  we feel content thinking about the safeplace fantasy land  i began to experience it since one year after losing one of my family member  sometimes saying it aloud makes me clam and with teared eyes    finally after it i am living one day at a time  Wow  I made an account just to comment  because it's amazing to me how much this could have been written by me  several years ago     I was in your exact position      I totally empathize with where you're coming from  "It sucks" is an understatement  I won't preach or tell you to buck up or exercise  I want to share a different perspective than other posters here    When I reached the same point as you did when you posted this  I was talking to a friend about it and rather than giving me a "You have so much to live for   you're not seeing things correctly" speech like society gives you  she told me that it would totally fuck over my kids  I pointed out that my daughter was 1 year old and wouldn't even remember me  but she explained how that didn't matter  and explained much it would hurt my children     She talked about people she had known and worked with  she had a job that involved helping people  whose parent had killed themselves and EVERY one of them was injured incredibly deeply  She told me I simply could not do that to my kids and that it wasn't an option  She informed me that my job is to be my kids' hero  even if whatever I have to do  sucks for me    She also to watch a documentary on suicide and its effects on the family  to give me a better understanding     Coincidentally one came on TV  i think it was IFC  and I watched it  WOW  how incredibly eye opening     I hadn't even considered all the ways suicide burdens children  friends  family  etc    It completely changed my view and saved my life  I left my wife eventually and like you expect from yours  my now ex wife made my life a living hell  She emptied our bank accounts  ran off with my car and my keys  canceled my health and car insurance  my phone  etc   basically made it almost impossible for me to even get to court  I didn't even have the money to take a cab there  didn't have a working cell phone  etc  Had I known she'd do this I would have covered my ass    But I survived  and now I have a great life  and my despicable ex wife isn't torturing me any more     My kids are happy and i  NOW  see how miserable I would have made them and how badly I'd have wounded them by killing myself     That is why I made this account and wrote this post  I want to save your kids  and yourself  from that pain too  I'm here to tell you that  sorry  you can't kill yourself  The amount of pain you are in now and the amount of pain you may temporarily endure when leaving your wife  will be FAR less than the pain your kids would experience for a LIFETIME  No can do     I'd like to point out that your username   jettison   is the wrong word  What you mean is "torture " Killing yourself would be to inflict pain upon your children that would last FAR longer and feel FAR worse than what you've been enduring  You're ready to tap out because of what you're experiencing  but you'd be putting the kids in an even worse situation and more pain      Not sure whether this is the documentary I watched but here are two links to a doc I found for you     http   topdocumentaryfilms com aftermath legacy suicide     https   www youtube com watch v C60memKFRu8     P S   now let me shift gears into another mode  I'd like to point out that your ex wife and your situation seem like an inescapable is a temporary problem  When you make it through  you will see it as a small problem  So much smaller than worth killing yourself over    I made it  You will too  PM me if you want to talk or even debate it  I think its normal  You feel free from all your problems  knowing its all over soon   Knowing you can exit anytime and being prepared is good  I also got my notes for everyone and i update them every month  But please  if you feel a little power  then try to live day by day  Maybe you can makenit till jan 12    I hope the joy you feel right now will last for longer than January 11  Hope you find a way to push through my friend    Congratulations  Welcome to freedom   I get you totally  it can be really frustrating when everyone goes into firefighting mode and the problem underneath never gets resolved    Are you intending to act on the thoughts  Because ultimately having thoughts isn't a reason to go into total panic mode on the part of the MH professionals  it's the intent to actually follow through which is the bit which is worrying   Hey Martin  Do you have any family members that can help  You are a child  She needs support but it isnt something you should necessarily have the answer to  If there is no one you can talk to a trusted adult  a doctor or a relevant charity for help  probably mental Health in this case like Mind uk  or your country's equivalent   i think they are allowed to say to parents authority unless they   strongly   believe you are going to kill yourself  i dont what your exact problems but i assume they are important  It is ok to describe them here  we can listen to you  Hey  I suggest you get advice from a therapist if you have one or your doctor  In the mean time I would see if you can get some familial or friend support  You should not have to deal with this alone  If you have reason to believe he's a danger to himself or anyone right this moment  please call 911  Hi  sorry to hear that you're going through a bad time at the moment  I think most people  from time to time have random stuff popping into their head and wonder where it came from  The problem comes when the thoughts start to upset you or make it difficult to get on with your life  If the thoughts you are getting are distressing to you  then it might be worth talking to someone professionally about them    It sounds like this might have been why you phoned the crisis centre this morning  and I am sorry you didn't get through to anyone  I'm not sure if this helps  but for future reference  there's a list of helplines in the sidebar of people you could call if you need to talk and can't get through to the crisis centre again   https   www reddit com r SuicideWatch wiki hotlines Hey    that was nice  Maybe there was a reason you were stopped  please know that people do care  Flick me a PM if you need     It just feels like I'm falling apart  But it's really cool that you're in high school too So when I went to pride  there was just about every type of person  I could recite the Mean Girls lunch room speech  And everyone was cool with whatever    You don't have to love booty shorts and glitter and Celine Dion  This doesn't change anything about you   You still like all the same music  sports  and clothes  and you still have the same friends and family  and nothing has changed about what you've done so far    It doesn't have to be scary  Just do things at your own pace and find a community  wether here or locally  and you'll make it out     That is correct the request for a psychiatrist and the antidepressant is new   I went home for Christmas holidays    I have bee striggglimg for a yr now That's the thing I don't care how girls look I just enjoy speaking to any and everyone that is nice and not a stuck up ones and nah I don't ask to be friends it tends to be I start chatting getting to know them and they say the don't have time for anyone else in their life atm or they are really busy and woint have time for me so it's better we don't get to know each other  I've gotten used to it though and I dunno I feel like if I was a little more confident it would be a little different  I've had dreams about cutting once  what I was saying was that i don't want to tell my irl friends about my online friends because I'm scared about what they would think  my parents don't know the true way I think about myself  but I need to go to a therapist  everybody in my "online friend group circle" has shared their face  age and names  we all try to be as honest as we can  i don't want to take a break of talking to them because they are the only reason I live  They have given me so much help and I haven't done shit  I don't want to go outside because I'm a tired bitch that has social anxiety and doesn't want to mess anything up again smh  I just keep on drifting on it because my mind is ironically fucked up  Totally  I feel like the stereotypical flamboyant gay guy is a small percentage of gay people   That's so great  Just keep it going  You've got this  Just put one foot in front of the other  and take this one day at a time   Glad to be of help  I hope I did something good for you  I wish you the best   I can see where that might be an embarrassing situation to be in  Its up to you of course  Do what you think best  but I really hope you don't decide to take the choice where we started  I think there are other options that are more attractive than that  Best wishes   Okay  and no  it's okay  thank you though  Okay  How's your support system  Been there and tried what  You're very welcome  and sleep tight  sweet dreams  How are you feeling today  darling  Heya mate  It seems things look pretty desperate to you right now  You may not see that things can change in the future  but for many of us  it has  Don't worry too much about relationships  or your looks  Have a look around you  Seriously  Most people aren't beautiful  Many ugly people are perfectly happy and have relationships  You don't fall in love with someone's looks  You fall in love with who they are as a person  Looks don't determine who you are  Many people are in their best behavior and their best looks for social gatherings  Don't feel bad about not loving social stuff  It's really very common  Maybe find a steady group of people to hang out with  if you can  I find gamers can make for excellent lively  socially awkward groupings  Have you ever played magic  the gathering  D  D  or played an mmo  If you're lonely  feel free to chat with the people here as well      I applied for emergency assistance through work   As terrible as this sounds  I also think I am going to start looking for a new place and let the chips fall where they may with the unpaid rent and file bankruptcy in a month or two when I can afford it   I'm putting my less optimistic plans on hold for now   I have a few things I am doing to try to make things better  I just have to live one day to the next right now  Okay  There's also the subs r rant and r venting if you'd like to post there too  Okay  How do you feel about switching  I am glad the drastic plan has been put on hold  That was my primary worry  Hopefully that one will be cancelled  I know that the idea of bankruptcy sounds terrible  but it isn't the end of the world  I am glad you have thought of some things that might help  and I wish you good luck in that  Wish I could do more  Take care   Here's the website for RAINN  rape  abuse  incest   https   centers rainn org and here's the website for a violence abuse hotline  http   www thehotline org We're listening to you  dude  Please don't do this  I'm so sorry to hear that your friend isn't being supportive  I know exactly what that's like  They just don't understand what it's like to feel the way that you do  Please know that you don't need to prove yourself or your illness to anyone  okay  I'm here for you  and so are these other wonderful  supportive people  At the end of the day  this is your choice  but I hope you're still here  I hope you're reading  And I hope you're well  I too  am glad you made it  Welcome back  Since your feelings haven't really changed  I'd like to point out that a suicide attempt makes the risk of you attempting again go up pretty steeply  This  of course  doesn't mean that you actually will  Just  please  if you haven't reached out yet  try and find professional help  You've reached rock bottom  Going up won't be easy  but  it's not impossible   Thanks for taking the time to reply and sharing your thoughts  that quote is also one i come across and quite liked so that's pretty cool  It is tough at the moment no doubt but i agree with you that among the shit there's definitely some beauty for sure  just gotta look for it  I might take you up on your offer if i'm ever feeling out of it  thanks again    Can you tell me what's brought you to this  Why do you say that  Thank you for sharing this and all the best  Hey  I read your post and I'll be more than glad to respond you as soon as I get on my computer  tho as a small note  I feel you  stay strong my friend    Being able to get some encouragement from a group of people who didn't make me feel judged is very  very good   Thank you for being here  What do you mean    There was a guy that said "Go fuck yourself no one care" to OP  He deleted the comment already  Okay  yeah definitely make sure to shoot me a message if you need to talk  Oh okay  sorry  I thought you meant that OP was the troll  Sorry for the misunderstanding  Okay  I understand  Does the other website I gave you help at all  Heya  First off  there's people who care out there  really  If you want to talk  feel free to chat with me any time  As to anxiety and having trouble with changing schedules  I personally also experience this  I was diagnosed with autism not too long ago  I'm not saying that you're autistic  obviously  but there might be underlying causes here  It could be worth looking into what's going on with you with a professional  I started my road to a proper diagnosis because I wanted to get a better handle on how to deal with myself and what I could and couldn't expect from myself and others  Additionally  I learned how to explain things about me  so the people close to me would be able to deal with me better  It's been rather enlightening  You probably should sit down with your mom and tell her you're perfectly willing to do things  but that sudden changes to the schedule make you anxious  If she needs you  you will of course be there  but if at all possible  it would be good for you to have a set schedule and to know what to expect  You are not a burden to your parents  If they didn't want you around they would have voiced that already  To be honest  them talking about you moving out with optimism in their voices is probably them being excited for you  It's a new phase in their child's life  I'm guessing they were happy to move out of their parents' homes  way back when  They're probably expecting a similar reaction from you  If at all possible  try to reach out  Get help  And remember  there's always Internet strangers willing to listen and chat   HA I hate when people tell you that crap  "It get's better"  Then when will it   Cause it's only been getting worse and worse as time goes on  I feel your pain   I'm really sorry to hear that you're struggling  Do you have a support system  Anybody supporting you  Could you check out the hotlines listed in the sidebar  In the 4th guideline for this sub  there are good resources  They emphasize that we should instead work on changing our responses to the outcomes in life   but not expect the outcomes to change  Both comparison and expectation are the thieves of joy    And  you say in an other post  whether or not you're on your meds  you think about suicide at least once a day  Some people here want to eradicate suicidal thoughts  but it is completely freeing to stop giving value to negative thoughts  Medication helps you know that it's possible to feel just a little different  and    you'd have to talk to someone else about it  I don't have the words    But likely  you feel less serious about suicide when you're on your meds  right  Why'd you go off them   I've gone off meds 4 times  and I think I'm off them for good unless I check into a psych ward again  or have perfect plans and schedule and feel like Lithium would help  But  if you find someone who won't push you back onto meds without options  but work with you on making sure you're on some consistent regimen  where you can reach the positives of when you were being medicated  then there's affirmation that there are people to help  You still have more thoughts about suicide now than when you were medicated  right    I think about suicide constantly  but I've promised myself I wouldn't do it  Even tho the past 3 yrs  I went out of the house less than 50 times  I still have connections from my youth  and the only way to discontinue their fragmentation is to stay alive and create the community I always wanted to  and work on eradicating loneliness  and contribute to the happiness  mental clarity  and willingness to live of at least 1 person for at least an extra second than would have been had if I didn't live  And I have to make up for excessive agony I've caused    It would be helpful to all here if you outlined in some capacity what you've worked on for the past 15 years  Thank you  and Happy New Year  I've really been trying to feel renewed this year  because all the past years got out of control and felt like a long day   All of them  you ok bro I'm sorry you feel this way  and wish that I could help    Unfortunately not everyone that suffers from cyclothymic disorder reacts to medication  This has been proven in numerous clinical studies  and your psychiatrist should be aware of it  Have you considered taking to them and making them aware that your current meds are not helping at all  And that you believe that just increasing the dose will not help with this   Have you had CBT  It has pretty high success rates with cyclothymic disorder  especially when anti depressants and mood balancer's have little or no impact  Try getting it if you haven't before  if you have and it hasn't worked  do you want to elaborate on why you feel it didn't    I understand that alcohol gives a release from the pain  the emptiness  but it is  as you are probably aware  self destructive and short term  Worse than that  it can often interact negatively with your medication    How bad do you think your drinking habits are  If you had another release for your depression  or when the euphoric feeling returns  would you want to stop drinking  Have you looked into local addiction assistance programs before    While the advice "it will get better" is useless  with cyclothymia  you will eventually revert to a period of euphoria  Please try your best to survive until then  Where are you located  General area  When on the brink of suicide  you are truly in the deepest of deep pits  If you give yourself the chance to make things better  they may  Suicide will end the suffering  but it will also end any chance of getting a better life  I have struggled with depression for many years  and have been suicidal at various times  Right now  I'm at the point where I'm starting to feel happy about little  seemingly insignificant things  Amongst all the darkness  I've learnt to smile again  Just saying that makes me tear up  Life can be beautiful  It can get better  It is far from easy  but to me  every thing of beauty and every small smile is worth the world  That darkness has given me the ability to  sometimes  be happy  and more importantly  to recognize when I am  It's more than I ever hoped for   Could you check out this website  http   www state nj us humanservices staff hotlines  Which one  Why did you reply to her comment though  Her comment had nothing to do with what you said  Okay  Did you look at the latest link I gave you  Started university  I was worried  but it turned out to be awesome  D  What kind of treatment have you sought tried up to this point   Also  realize that you're still growing  Sometime between now and 25  things may taper off and your moods may stable out   The sidebar on the right can give you some resources  Okay  Could you call the town hall for where you live and request a number for a hotline  You seem like a very capable person  You say you regret wasting 2 5 years playimg WoW  but if you choose to live  you can devote the rest of your life to making that time up  Who's to say you won't become the first blind programmer that creates something that changes the industry  You are a work in progress  everyone is  invest in yourself because  I promise  your dreams are worth it  Heya  If you want to have a talk  feel free to contact me  You don't have to be entirely alone  There's the entirety of the Internet out there  I'm so sorry you feel this way  I really hope that things will change for you  one way or the other  You should be receiving more care than you are now  Have you disclosed to your therapist that you are at risk of suicide again  and that you need a more permanent form of care  Failing at having a relationship for a few years isn't the end of the world  It might help to try and relax a little  Of course  that's much easier said than done  Try not to be so hard on yourself  Confidence is sexy  so fake it til you make it  That's what most of the world does anyway  If you ever crawl out of this  you'll be such an inspiration to so many  Don't give up  kind stranger  We may need you  Dude I'm not trying to be a dick  But you need to tell her to fuck off  Like for real  if you've got nothing to live for  then might as well throw in a little confrontation man  Who knows  maybe the fact that you're acting too pussy in this regard is what's dragging you down so far everywhere else in life   You have the control over your own life  So what do you want to say to her  Do you want to call her a bitch  Do you what to tell her that she is being untrustworthy  Do you want to tell her to fuck right off for constantly disrespecting you  Do you want to tell that the father's day incident was bullshit  Dude just do it  There is not a single person in this world you can take away what you really think  All you've got is your integrity man  and every day that you stand in the same room as her and say nothing you are losing your power    Same to you  kind stranger  Feel free to hit me up if you want to chat  Lots of love  I have a lot of loving and understanding family and friends  Both my parents struggled with depression suicide attempts  This isn't a panic induced response or anything  I just really want to die  Thank you for responding though  your username is apt    Okay  I understand  How do you feel about therapy  That is really well put  You've articulated my feelings about this  If you've put serious time and effort into a decision like that  and write a letter detailing why it is the best option  your loved ones will be forced to at the least try to empathize and rationalize your death  This knowledge has to soften the blow for them  compared to something like an impulsive suicide or one that completely blindsides them     What is wrong with me  what is so fundamentally wrong that I cannot find help  that I cannot help myself and no one cares   Nothing is wrong with you  but there may be something wrong with the experiences  relationships  and traumas that have made you into someone that is this upset  I know you said you tried medication before  and it made you numb  but perhaps you can try a different kind  I hope this feeling passes and you are able to feel stable  and eventually happy   First off  I understand feeling worthless as a child  My dad decided  when I was very young  that I wasn't the perfect child he wanted  That meant I wasn't wanted  by him at least  So I understand that feeling   As for feeling like there's nothing  I just have a hard time believing that there's absolutely nothing you can look forward to  I mean  have you tried any of the hotlines  I did use the texting one once  nobody showed up at my door worried that I was at risk  You might get some kind of insight or help  Or you could talk to me on here  or through PMs  I really do hope that you find some comfort  Be aware that your decision is yours to make  and I don't judge  But I'm here to offer a listening ear  And no  this wasn't too ranty or anything  Don't let this asshole take your life  You're better than that  You can do so much better  They aren't worth your worries  Do what YOU want for a while  Be yourself  Don't let your life get away from you because other people make it hard  It's your only chance to live  Find the beauty in the little things  and enjoy it   I just started going about a month ago  been taking antidepressants as well  I just feel physical pain whenever I do anything  Okay  Have you told your therapist this  Nah man I'm here to say that you are being a little bitch  You  in your current state of mind  is a little bitch  You have to fix your state of mind All the best to you  I'm so happy for you  If you're ever on here again  I hope it's as a commenter  offering a listening ear  Other than that  begone with you   3 Did the people ever face legal repercussions for what they did you to  Okay  I understand  How do you feel about pressing charges  Therapists are obligated to report you if you say you are planning to kill yourself  I'd rather not deal with that   Hey there you  I'm glad you came and asked  It takes a lot of courage to ask for help  Be proud that you're there  These people are really only here because they sincerely want to help  there's nothing to be afraid of  That said  being admitted into a mental health clinic won't fix your problems  It will just minimise the risk of anything drastic happening to you in the near future  Healing is a REALLY long process  If you think you can keep from suicide in the immediate future  weeks or months   think about seeing a psychologist regularly  It's vital that you get help ASAP  which is probably why the facility was brought into the picture  Psychologists and psychiatrists often have rather busy schedules  so starting talks with them would take a while  Let us know what happens  and feel free to chat if you want to   Anti Depressants often act as mood moderators  If you have mood swings they will probably help  That being said you are going to have to try a few before you find one that works well and it can take six weeks before the effect is felt    Talk to a doctor and give them a try  Do you want to tell us about what's going on  I'm interested  As a suicidal individual  that is the most terrifying part  along with the risk of failing to succeed  surviving with horrific permanent injuries   I visualize all my loved ones in shock and horror  and being very fucked up over my suicide for a long time  Maybe for the rest of their lives    Those are the 2 reasons that stop me from doing it  But my own pain  suffering and misery also deeply affects them  my attempts to whitewash it and lie only causes further distancing  Vicious circle  If they know how hopeless and helpless I am  and that they are unable to help  it starts to justify things  In my journals  which are written directly to them  the entire focus is on desperately trying to argue my case so that they will have to understand why I chose to do this    I'm quite aware of suicide being the most selfish act one can manifest  But to me it's also a very rational one  Maybe that means I'm crazy  but when I hear about someone killing themselves  I think about how brave they are to take control and end their own suffering   Okay  I understand  Could you contact the police and ask them about pressing charges  I feel as if that would make many aspects of your life easier  Okay  I understand  I do   i also feel that my mind is giving in  i am pointing to die   i have a plan     write a suicide letter  pack my stuff in the car   go on face book post a good bye   go o a secluded area and take as many pills as i can    if you see my history it has gone on hard for awhile   no one cares  been crying for 1 hr straight   I am dead inside They close up in under a week but remain bumpy up to 3 Okay  I understand  Some hotels do this  could you try working at a hotel in exchange for a free room  That'll help with the homeless issue  Glad to be of help  Best of luck to you  If I can encourage some more  just drop a line  I'll be around   No problem  That guy pissed me off so bad  Why even reply with negativity for no reason  Anywho have a great day  I wish you the best  I went through some of your posts and it made me very teary  Stay strong    Angelinwhite  Thanks for still being here with us  Yes  I think you do want help  No  you do not deserve to die  The first is opinion  the second is fact  I can't tell you how to make life wonderful  I haven't found that one either  I can tell you that life can be great  and it can drive you nuts  Up and down  around and around  Relationships are far too complex to address here  whole books have been written by people far smarter than me  But if you feel love  and want to find love  then life is your only way  No other choice will allow that   Right before I went to College my dad told me he never wished I was his son  My family has been broke since I was a kid and I was absolutely ready to get the fuck out of my house  All my friends have nice structured families and they have a safety net that they can always fall into  I do everything right and still get fucked over without having a nice net to fall into  In high school I stopped giving a fuck because I was always getting screwed over one way or another  I smoked and still smoke weed constantly to get away  At this point I would like to physically beat the hell of God if he is there  However  the only reason I dont give up and just jump of a bridge is really only because I have so much hate in me  So much bitterness about the world that I just want to basically become something and tell everyone to fuck off  I subliminally think of life as an entity that is always fucking me over and one day  one fucking day  I will finally kick its ass and do something  I dont know why it helps but I admire animals in the wild when they fight to their final angry and bloody breath  It's a hateful and powerful spirit that lashes out not to harm but purely out of necessity  If life is gonna take me out  I want to be the hardest thing it has ever killed  One day I got sick of being a skinny little kid that just rolled over when shit happened and I basically went after the world like a starved animal  Im still in the pit and I fight everyday to get out  but one day I'll get out and I'll finally get to see the other side  The side of comfort and I'll get to look into the shitty hole I crawled out of and smile for once cause I actually did it  With the things I have to do  I could probably die  but at least I'll die fighting like millions of other lives before me  Hi again  What happened to what you might miss  Did something change  We talked a couple days ago  I thought you were applying to university  What's happening   thank u men  The risk of failing to succeed and survive with horrific and permanent injuries  Also the tiny uncertainty of what lies after  Yeah true  but they're trolls so that's what they do  And thank you  I really appreciate that  Thank you for being here as well and you stay strong as well  I've acted and I failed  Saw the aftermath  The pain I've inflicted on my family  Things has never been the same since  I truly saw that in my situation not speaking for anyone else or in the act itself because I've been there I understand  but simipily for me it was selfish  It was selfish of me to hurt those that love me  That's great to hear  Dont take shittalk online at face value  most of them wouldnt say it to your face  Is there public transportation  Hey there   Can you tell me more about yourself   I'm here to listen if you feel like talking   I'd love to hear from you Wanna talk it our  And i can give you some advice  22 is very young   Try to remember that all things are temporary  Want to talk about it  I'm here to listen if you feel like talking  I'd love to hear from you Wanna talk about it  Maybe get it off your chest  You can open up here  we dont judge   If you are really that far down in the hole  you can always turn to your instincts  From the beginning of mankind  the world has been brutal  but we are ruthless creatures  You may not see it now  but you can certainly pull some magic out of your ass and pull through  Because somewhere down this long ass road called life  you'll be content  happy even  and you'll look back and appreciate yourself so much more for fighting back  Hell I got through my first few weeks by just taking a walk everyday and trying to build little odd end things  Also I got kicked off my Minecraft server that I probably spent  300 on and I built and entire city just to watch it be deleted  I couldn't do anything mainly because I was too poor to fly to Ukraine and murder the server owner but I understand where you are coming from  It's very easy for server owners to fuck you over so I tend to stray away from any particular server or just stick to single player games   I read it  and I wish you wouldn't do that  Want to tell us a little more   Is there any specific reason they wont hire you  Wanna talk about it  Snow problem  D Life rarely works out the way anyone planned it to  There is an old joke that says if you want to make God laugh  tell him your plans  Disillusioned is one thing  suicidal is a whole other ballpark  Meeting people can be hard  finding one you really like can be trickier still  Want to talk about it   I'll second that notion  I never harmed while on vacation  but the time I decided not to pack any blades I just about freaked out because the option wasn't there   I don't care about what I 'might' miss  does that even make sense when you're dead  To survive you need energy and strength  My supply of that is below low  it's reaching zero  Where's the energy and motivation to fight a whole education when you don't even have enough to keep on living  Or am I supposed to work a job I won't even like  just to survive in a worthless life  Always hated school and the teachers who never care  I don't want an underpaid job which will tear me even more apart with stress    Thanks for your response  It's appreciated   Advice is all I ask for homie In my experience  here in the Midwest  that's the case  This so much  I don't die because all I feel is raw hate and resentment towards the world  I am driven by my hatred and I hate everybody and everything  and as a result  dying would be capitulating  Wow  what a read   My therapist prescribed me Xanax  so that whenever I feel afraid or depressed about doing something constructive  I can take one and power through it  Maybe you should give it a try  I understand about the supplies getting low  been there done that  Tired as hell  but still here  Education isn't something you fight  its a tool  Something you use to make yourself better  more able to achieve what you set out to  Whether that's a particular job or being a painter  that's up to you  Why is life worthless to begin with  Talk to me   Thanks for your comment  i appreciate that someone else can relate     Hey im only 17 and unfortunately im ready to die is well  I have nothing to live for but something is still keeping me back I dont know what but something is  I just want to let u know that your not alone and we just have  to keep fighting this together because from my opinion there is tons of people out there who doesnt know what the fuck are we going through but there are a few people who knows and cares of what others are feeling   I dont know if u heard of an application called LINE  I think its a pretty cool app if u want me to talk to more so u might not feel so alone im here to talk to My ID is niki15sassy all I can do at the moment is to be here and listen to u  Why are you quitting your job  if you don't mind me asking  No  this helped a lot  When I posted this I was really upset and not thinking clearly  I wasn't thinking the crisis text line was going to be like that but maybe I just got a bad volunteer  I am definitely going to contact them about it because I felt that I was a real danger to myself and in a way she was almost encouraging me to harm myself    I know it's not my fault that these are just not nice people but it still hurts to an extent  Everything just piled up on me at once and I couldn't cope as well as I usually do  I really appreciate your comment so much  It did calm me down a good bit when I read it last night  thank you so much   No  you don't  Have you talked to anyone at the University health facility  Depression isn't like severe bleeding  Any idiot can see someone is bleeding  it takes a bit more to perceive depression  Sometimes you have to ask for help  Maybe you have  Please  please  don't fall into the trap of " they'll be sorry when I'm gone"  That's spite  and it may or may not be true  Depends on who you are talking about  I don't know about this case  bit sometimes they just shrug and say oh well  This is about getting you the help you need  not making some other person regret something   Hey your not alone and even if ur family is there to listen or not it is never easy to go up to them and tell them how u feel specially if its mental  health problems  Sometimes I find that it is easier to talk to strangers online then someone that I know  So I dont know if u know an application called LINE but my ID on it is niki15sassy so if u want to text me and just to talk to someone im here to listen   Ay thanks for reading  We tried anxiety meds before but it doesn't mix well with some of my other medical meds  They don't think I have anxiety and I don't either  It's a legit fear  You should talk to your family  tell them how you feel man  you dont have to go through with this you know Why do you feel that way   I'm here if you feel like talking  Wanna talk more about it   Why do you think you might feel relief   I'm here to listen if you feel like talking   i don't do it for the scars themselves  but i almost always cut to the point of needing stitches leaving a huge scar  it makes me feel like the emotional pain is more real valid since i have a permanent mark to show for it Dont live in the past  try your best to block it out  look for a new life move away  get away from the people that put you down and make life a missery  Ending it would mean no more pain  I feel like ive been suffering all my life  Its not going to get better  edit need to sleep Education feels like fighting though  It would be a tool if I didn't have to do all the work without proper teachers or with such low energy  I probably can't even finish my current term  My neck's so stiff from stress I take painkillers and drink tea to be able to sleep  I don't know if that actually helps with anything  but I think it might  You'd imagine the school counsellor could help with that but he didn't even give a suggestion     All the memories I have to remember and all issues I have  I hate being emotionally depleted and volatile  I hate being angry and sad about everything  but I am  How to deal with so many conflicting emotions  At the same time  a psychiatrist could help me  I want help  unfortunately healthcare in this country is broken and I don't want to end up with my old sexist psychiatrist   thanks for the support  it's just been overwhelming lately I understand that part  We all get that way sometimes  life has a way of piling it on  All I can say is take it one step at a time and try not to let it get you down  Best wishes   I don't  I'm sorry you do  I doubt you do it for attention  Hell  even if you did that's a desperate call for attention that needs help  I'd just ignore her  I'm sure your dad does the same  Maybe it's just reassurance from her behalf to that it isn't something worse  Have you tried therapy medication   I started therapy this year because my husband left me  It was the best decision I ever made  It helped changed my perspective and outlook on life  Just something to consider  I hope you sleep well and I'm still here if you want to talk when you wake up  I am sorry you had a psychiatrist that didn't work out for you  I don't know much about that sort of thing  I can understand that education is a battle without proper guidance  Stress can do so many things to us       How to deal with conflicting emotions is a harder topic than I can answer  I am no doctor  or anything like that  All I can advise you to do is keep trying and all I can do is offer you support  I hope you can find someone to help you that can do some good
