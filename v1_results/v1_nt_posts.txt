It sounds quite a lot like a stationary bowler that does less damage and can't counterattack  I like where your head is at  but I can't see why someone would run this when the bowler is only one elixir more  
No  the new german dds are so fast and torp range so far that you're dead   Your guns are worthless  Torp range short

There is a "true" for NegaReddit also  but it's made by the same people I think   They probably preemptively made it  as I don't see any other reason to make a true for your sub with less than 10000 subs

Not officially  Saban did send player to the locker room though  But if the ref meant 93 instead of 98  it would have been allens 2nd unsportsman like  i believe  So there is some serious consequences that could come from it 
You should always use a condom with a ONS  even if she says she is on the pill  First  she could be lying and trying to get pregnant  it happens   and secondly and most likely  she could have a STD  It definitely feels better without a condom  and I've had plenty of one night stands without one  but that wasn't exactly smart  Just please do yourself a favor and wear one  Don't be reckless

I have this one female friend that's always unreliable about hanging out   so her plans for NYE looked like they were falling short  so I invited her out   few hours go by  figure she wasn't up to coming out  I'm like an hour away  in a city   she lives in the suburbs    she then tells me she's not coming up  but invites me over    I tell her no because I had plans  then she gets mad at me for not telling her about those plans when I invited her up    when we both know she wasn't going to come up     in conclusion   I know nothing

I'm new to the game and loving it  thus far  but what are some of the other issues   Balancing issues for classes or game modes   
I'm currently leveling a new character from 4 to 30 solely in Survival  currently level 25  I'm having a lot of fun doing it but I'm not sure I would recommend it    You can't use the gear you get as a reward because it is all high end  ie you have to be level 30 to equip it   Also  once you do hit 30 the gear that you do get will mostly only be gear score 163 and will be useless very quickly    Also  it's pretty slow as you need three to four successful extractions per level to level up and that is 2 hours each session  assuming you extract    However  if you just love the mode as I do then it is worth it  Also you could just alternate and run a couple Survival runs then do some story missions or events to mix it up

It didn't necessarily 'work out' it's just the reality of the atmosphere composition currently  Populations of animals that couldn't survive with today's atmosphere haven't  and species that can  do  The atmosphere has changed quite a bit over the history of the earth  abundant to non existant Oxygen C02 at various times   Living things that can take advantage of what's in the air and use it to survive are the ones that succeed   One common example of this is the dinosaurs  They were able to be gigantic   and thereby consume more food  because there was MUCH more oxygen in the air during that time  An animal that large couldn't be successful in today's atmosphere  and that's why there aren't any anymore   So  in summary  the organisms that have survived in the world are the ones able to take advantage of the air in their environment and use it to be successful

i think that only works well if you're a real super pro dribbler   in my experience the biggest sidden boost I got in 2v2 was learning to maintain good space from your teammate so you're always ready to go offence or defense depending on what happens   And never go for the risky aerial shots   Most other players WILL go for dumb risky shots  and it's amazing how much you can rank up just waiting around to take advantage of your opponents' mistakes

Stop abusing kratom  and only take enough to get you through the day  The last thing you want is a tolerance that mitigates plain leaf from working  Then you get hooked on extracts UEI and it's a massive downhill plunge from there  You got this   and your better than that  At least you realize this and can nip it in the butt before things really get out of control  I have read about people on Reddit taking several 25 gram doses throughout the day  That's absurd  Smoke weed  it really synergies well w kratom  and really lessens the amount of Kratom needed to be effective  A little Kava every now and then is wonderful too  That  however  can also can be a slippery slope  Make sure you're exercising a lot enough too  Kratom isn't the cure to addiction  but it's IMO the best harm reduction tool there is  Use it wisely  Also  keep yourself occupied  Immerse yourself into a hobby or profession  Vaping E Cigs are a PHENOMENAL tool  I own a shop and liquid company and can help you out if u need it  Just shoot me a DM  Anyways  That's my two cents  Have a great new year  may the force be with you  my friend

I Would Like to Fuck you Again 
I used to be in the same boat as you  Having the holy paladin shoulders  I figured that damaging myself would actually increase healing on my beacon targets as other healers healing me redirects to them  But looking at my logs from the past and now  I can definitely say it is more mana efficient to HS on CD  which you should be doing anyway  and trying to get 100  efficiency on your IoL  Yes  IoL increases healing of FoL  but if you don't need that massive heal HL heals pleanty  especially if it crits  The only time I find myself using LotM is when I'm having to move to a mechanic and people are taking damage AND my HS is on CD  If you want I can link you some logs and take a look at yours to compare LotM usage vs other abilities  
Yes  logically  but would you let 1 player camp the enemy goal to disturb goal keeping  That's just weak  it turns the game in a 2v2  Would you demo the goalie every single time you get a chance on goal  Random demo anyone who wants to hit the ball    No  or if you would  you have some serious lack of skill in the game   EDIT  about not being aware of surroundings  it's bullshit if you claim that you can dodge every bump or demo with good surroundings   You can't turn your camera quickly enough  there is too much to watch etc  it's just not possible

The only thing that throws me is why they are playing singleplayer when they could be doing an old school LAN party with something classic 
 The only reason you are able to watch a movie at the theatre is  because  they play ads   They don't make much money from the movie tickets  and they have a ton of overhead with building expenses  staff  projectors media server sound system chairs etc   Many theatres lose money on ticket sales alone and depend on concession   advertising   special event revenue to stay profitable  So Cineplex doesn't exist without these things  If you like watching movies in the theatre  deal with it 
I hope this game cheers me up  cause so far this is my worst new year's day  it's already 2017 in Greece 
There's plenty video out there  We are aware of how it works 
Thanks for reminding me TWD is on

A lot of people are giving rules of thumb based on CP  but the real rule is ring color  If the ring is deep red  just use a berry and Ultra Ball  and don't be shocked if it still breaks out  The species and CP don't matter  really  You don't need to remember the CP scale and catch rate of each species  just look at the ring color   Pikachu is a lot easier than the starters  You'll notice the ring color is more orange than red  compared to the starters   I had 300  Ultra Balls a couple weeks ago  I'm down to 150 now  I expect to be out by the end of next week  And that's fine with me  this is why I saved them up in the first place

I heard the same thing about power of 10 puzzles  I don't know if that one was ever awarded  They were pretty hard and I'm pretty sure everyone just googled someone else solving the answer  So maybe they canned it because of that  But why  it just means people want your product  Maybe because its not fair to the solvers  I don't know   I have met the NVidia guys at quakecon and they are pretty good guys  Nvidia and EVGA give out tons of stuff  I suspect some BYOC sales go to cover that  but not nearly all of it  Nvidia maybe have just not announced the winners but still given out prizes  Maybe they have a reason for it  I really doubt its purely to Fuck with people   I would "Nicely" ask Tom if he has any info about the winners  Although they have CES in like 4 days so I would expect a response in maybe 2 weeks  https   blogs nvidia com blog author tom petersen  Clay Causin is another super cool guy 
That was me and the bible   I was watching Mississippi Burning with my boyfriend and there's something in it about the bible condoning slavery   He had a Catholic Easy Reading Bible and a huge King James   I had my sisters BOM Bible combo   I read it from front to back as to not take anything out of context and used a highlighter and pen to make notes   The inconsistencies were incredible and all the misogyny absolutely disgusting   I got to the New Testament that is known for being so much better and it wasn't  in fact that's where the instructions about beating slaves is   And Jesus was a racist and bigot  And then it just dawned on me that all religion is shit and I became a an Atheist Humanist

I'd never put any amount of oil on my brushes or sponges personally  One it's a breading ground for bacteria and two just oils from your face can cause 'hard pan' where the top layer becomes hard and unusable  The only way to fix it is scrape the layer off  which is a huge waste  This sounds like its just asking for a bunch of hard pan    I'm sure they will be fine they will probably just need a few good washes  Use warm water too  not too hot   Oil won't budge as much in cold water  Good luck

I had a number of friends look over this before submitting it here  and none caught the lack of Iceborn Gauntlet  Well that's unfortunate  I'd do something like this      Iceborn Gauntlet     Wondrous item  very rare  requires attunement    While wearing this gauntlet  unarmed strikes with the gauntleted hand deal 1d6 bludgeoning and 1d6 cold damage    After casting a spell of 1st level or higher  your next successful melee attack with the gauntlet causes magical ice to radiate outward from your target in a 15 foot radius  This ice creates difficult terrain for all hostile creatures  but does not affect creatures that you consider allies  The ice lasts until the end of your next turn   Additionally  while wearing the gauntlet  you have resistance to fire damage

I remember a few years ago seeing my first commercial before a movie  and it was just one  Then some previews  then the movie proper  But it was weird because up until that point  commercials before a movie just weren't a thing  Now it's a whole schwack of commercials  plus previews before the movie   I could see movie theatres phasing out in my life time  much like drive in movies  Most people have good movie watching set ups at home now  and dealing with expensive snacks and drinks  and the risk of screaming kids  movie talkers  or butt helmets on cell phones ruining the experience  many of us would prefer to watch movies at home

but that would be unfair  A level 12 player at arena 8  would be stuck there forever only for lack of skill  If someone has the same amount of trophies as you should YES win and lose the same ammount of trophies as you  no matter the level  This "matchmaking is broken" thing is no more than an excuse  If the guy is at the same trophy range as you  it means that he loses and wins to about the same opponents as you  which means it is COMPLETELY right for you to face him  And if he has more trophies than you  you already lose less than 30

Nope  I'm just tired of the overall whining in the community about game balance issues  Seems like someone is always complaining about how his or that needs a nerf or how they wish something was needed and they don't like it  I've been a gamer since games were born  I just wish gamers in general would grow up a little  Also  as I've said numerous times    Nobody ever stops to REALLY think about how massive an undertaking something like Destiny is  The human factors such as staffing  how many moving parts there are  what that entails in terms of running a business  and what headaches come with trying to keep everyone happy and having  wait for it  FUN    It's a living thing and it's on a truly monstrous scale  It's not easy  Everyone should lighten up a bit and cut Bungie some slack

"Deserving" is a highly subjective thing also to the point of being bloody useless  if you're throwing out the populist vote   it just devolves into a nostalgia goggle war   I mean you could legitimately argue AoE2 for a strong test of time game  but objectively as possible I'd have to say that Tetris is probably the undisputed winner in that category   Though if you had to limit it to a single incarnation of a game  for me it would be UFO  Enemy Unknown   x com   I've been playing that game every other year  at least  for 22 years now

People focus so much on the technology that defined your childhood when discussing which generation you belong too    In Australia   we have a Generation Y which overlaps Gen X and millennials   I happily identify with Gen Y   I don't identify with X or millennials     My boyfriend is only 2 years younger than me   so we're from the same generation  But his family is several social classes above me and grew up in urban UK while I grew up in rural Australia   We compared how old we were when certain technology came into the house    He was born with a PC in the house   I was in my third year of school when dad bought one   He was 6 when they got the Internet at home  dial up   and 8 when they got broadband  I was 10 when we got dial up   and we never for broadband until I moved out at 19 into an area that had broadband   First mobile phone was at 12 for him and 19 for me   I was 22 when I got my first smart phone  he was 17  From day dot he would use digital encyclopedias to complement assignments   I was at the library checking out books until I was 14  and our library got personal use computers with Internet   But the city library had computers for a decade    I'm 2 years older   but I was 4  years behind on tech because of accessibility and affordability    Long story short  I don't feel like I belong to any generation because people are always talking about technology and how it defines you   But it's not just when you were born that shapes your relationship with tech  What other measures are there to define a generation

Dont count male Hakuno out yet  If the rewrites of extra for extella's canon are anything to go by  we may see him AS WELL AS fem hakuno  In fact its still possible that fem hakuno isnt Saber's master at all  The only scene we saw her in was her half disappearing  disconnected from Nero  I rly hope NeroXfem MC is a thing  and i dont think theyd completely bait and switch  but male hakuno actually has a high chance of appearing after extella's lore and the backstories of their characters  Nasu has even mentioned feeling limited in writing the original extra 
That would be great  looking forward to the progression of your game and when you have time if possible can you add  a script for when the user talks into the HMD mic at certain times of day like mornings due to the change in temperature the users can see there own breath  that's if you are planning on having a day and night cycle  summer  winter plateau to mountain tops this could be a great little feature to give the user a sense of temperature change  Keep up the good work  to all your team

Maybe the core could instead be a sort of short range AoE DoT attack where Backblast throws his engine into overdrive  hits the afterburners and releases an initial blast that does high damage  based on proximity  maybe up to 5k at point blank  and proceeds to to damage over time for several seconds  This would also push Backblast back and help it gain space from enemy titans    Edit  When you say "rocket" do you mean it shoots one out or it has a rocket attached to it

Gelukkig nieuwjaar  It was a wonderful night  Enjoy yours  
You mean like Age of Empires 2   Holy fuck  this is annoying  Unless you people would've disqualified TF2 had it been updated to Source 2  trying to make the argument "It got a visual HD re release which means it doesn't stand the test of time " feels silly 
I have an alt  I have played him very little at max level  but have done normal raids with him   Basically  I got to max level and started artifact knowledge  then waited for it to get high before trying to fill in the artifact   You end up spending 1 10 of the time you would on your main

  CONGRATS ON YOUR REWARD     Oh     wait    
I've decided to just use regular balls on the first stage  Great balls on the second stage  and Ultra Balls on the third stage starters  got a Charizard and a Venusaur today  so I got to use 'em    I've lost a couple of them  but it's far less stressful to use up a handful of Pokeballs than to use up as many Ultra Balls  And you can save the Ultras for things you  really  want

Wow that is just terrible 
Mine just started doing this last week  Didn't play for a few days  Started opening in Windowed mode  After doing all the known fixes it's stuck in Windowed Fullscreen  Never had this problem until 1 5 and no fix for it yet  Tried editing all the state cfg and GFX settings files  Set them to read only and tried without  Changed them countless times  Alt Enter doesn't work either  Nor does running it as Admin or compatibility mode  
As someone else said  turn off your auto reload on the rep    I think you got very lucky in this fight  If you try to brawl destroyers you want to orbit as close as possible  either through the orbit command at 500m  or preferably manually even closer  I'm surprised you didn't die  actually  it would be interesting to see the fit of the coercer you killed  
No  And I say no for various reasons    Smite is a MOBA who's main selling point besides mythology incorporated and the third person POV is multiple gamemodes  You aren't forced to play a 5v5 game mode if you are interested in the game but want to play it casually  Duel serves it's niche as a gamemode that you can actually outplay your opponent and be rewarded because of it instead of losing because the opposing team has a better team comp or several better players     There are high tier gods for every gamemode and ridiculing Duel because of it is absurd  Those high tier gods are countered by gods in similar tiers and even lower tiers     Duel also exists as an alternate method of obtaining the end of season ranked rewards if players cannot commit fully to playing Ranked Conquest or finding consist players to party with in Ranked Joust     Lastly  who is affected by Duel's existence  No one is being impacted negatively by it and if players dislike the mode  they can simply not play it  Removing the mode however would negatively impact the players who play it and enjoy it

no way to know for sure  but it is not that far below the 1080 in terms of performance  I would not recommend the 1080 unless you just have money to spare because the increase in performance over the 1070 is not really worth double the price

 i should accept their insurance company  and whatever is left  sue them      NO     That's exactly what you DON'T do     Normally  you sue the driver  You have no relationship whatsoever to their insurance company  They have insurance so that the insurance company will  I presume  pay for their defense  and  if you win  will pay you whatever you win  up to the limit of the policy  If the policy doesn't cover the full amount  then you will have already sued and won for the balance  and can take whatever legal remedy is appropriate  garnishment  seizure  whatever    The insurance company will likely offer to settle  If you think their offer is fair  accept it  and that's all there is to the matter  Otherwise  reject the offer or make a counteroffer 
I'm pretty sure it's usually either a case of just not understanding that people  can  have different preferences  I had it out with a friend of mine once  that no  I really  don't  like spicy foods  And if people can have such a hard time grasping  that  concept  it's no wonder that they don't understand bigger differences   or it's part of a cycle of peer pressure    them having kids for whatever reason    them not being happy with it    convincing themselves they are  as a means of coping    passing that pressure on because they need the reinforcement to help them stay convinced and live in denial   Heaven forbid anyone should break that paper thin illusion for them by being happily without kids and thus provide evidence that making more babies is not the only way to go  Then they'd have to confront the reality of their own regrets and unhappiness  I'm not even being sarcastic  it must really suck to be stuck with kids and in denial that they're okay with it because society holds baby production up on a sacred pedestal

Even as a sidegrade there is no reason to use this gun  The knockback is the only redeeming quality right now  even then it is incredibly inconsistent and can not be relied on  Otherwise there is almost no reason to use this weapon  Double donking is rarely worth it  the amount of time you spend timing the fuse you could easily do 200 damage with stock  as opposed to a chance to do 106 131 damage  assuming it actually does double donk since the projectile moves incredibly slow  otherwise it's less than 100 damage

Your state of residence is still important   Different SOLs for different places   If it's four years for the SOL  and some places are   and you're correct about the date of first default of 9 12  then finding a payment record could be vitally important  as the suit may be beyond the SOL for filing   Being outside the SOL is not a protection  it's an affirmative defense   you still need to file an answer with the court  or it'll default against you   Now  just to be clear  the court date has not happened yet  right

My rule of thumb for static holds is that if I can hold it for 60 seconds  it is time to make it more difficult by adding weight   This is a pain to do with normal planks unless you have plates   Side planks are pretty easy to add weight to   Just rest a dumbbell on your side    it gives you additional incentive to hold still   I also strongly recommend you look into the  hollow hold  https   www youtube com watch v LlDNef Ztsc    It probably wins the award for simplest looking hard exercise ever   I have actually found it to be more beneficial than planks

She's still alive  I've moved to the other side of the country and we rarely speak  An occasional text at most  It was actually incredibly easy to pretty much cut her out  because she doesn't make any real effort to contact me either    My husband's family live in the same town as her and when we visited I would try and reach out to see her  but even if we're there for a week or two I would only see her once  for about an hour at most  She doesn't seem too interested in seeing me  or her grandchildren so I gave up trying  I'll tell her I'm in town  just in case we run into each other  but that's it    What kills me tho  is that my children won't have a real grandmother  Growing up I never met my Dad's parents  because they live in another country  and my mom's mom was always very mean  distant  and generally treated me and my sisters as though we were something to be tolerated   I learned later it's because she's racist against my dad  For a long time I thought the kinds of grandma's you see on tv  the loving happy to see you hugging kind of grandma wasn't real  But then I met my husband's mom and grandmother  They're the kind of mom and grandma I'd always wanted  I was so happy that my kids would have them  But then 2 years ago his mom died from a long illness  We were crushed and now my kids won't have a real grandma either  So I've sworn to be the mom I always wanted  and to be the grandma I always wanted when they have their own kids  I've got a long way to go  as the oldest is only 8  so I'm jumping ahead a bit   Sorry for the long reply  and for practically telling you my life story  I just needed to get this off my chest

Typically when starting a new class it will tell you on the creation screen  unless I'm misremembering  what their primary stats are   Even so  why I don't necessarily disagree that perhaps there should instead be a 'you should pick this' kinda indicator or some such  I still don't see why NOW after 12  years they decided to gut the quest rewards  Plus  whilst leveling you can use pretty much anything and still succeed to level  by the time stats and gear start to really matter it's all you CAN pick  MoP onwards  anyway   Forgot to add  the character stats panel also tells you what your ideal primary stats should be  It will outright say what each stat does for your class  And these days it won't even list those that do nothing for you  my rogue is using an int belt right now for RP and int isn't even listed on my attributes

 I see your point though  If I'm getting paid 8 hours to let's say put stock on the shelf and I get it done in 6 hours how come I can't get full 8 hours pay   I guess that's the difference between getting paid by the hour and getting paid by the job     Same reason places rush to spend their budget at the end of the year  The guy in charge will see you didn't use it all so obviously you don't need that much and it gets cut  For work they see you do it in 6 and assume all the other times it took 8 were you "not working " I fucking hate that mentality because the amount of time it takes to do something could change for an infinite amount of reasons

I think they are a brilliant idea for children with ADHD  or for parents who themselves are bad at paying attention  In the latter cases  I  know the argument can and will be made that the parents themselves should do better at watching their kids  But this isn't always possible  such as the parent also having ADD ADHD  and in the end I'd rather have the kids be safe

I'm learning siege in tournaments as of now  Is there any good tips with siege decks like must require this card  etc    Also I like playing Mortar and Xbox very much but I have trouble deciding which of these are viable ATM

It would be nice if MS bought gave the IP to someone else who would be up to making Ryse 2 
Might be because of my deck  even if she hits the nuts  I still board wipe her very easily  Of course  there are times when I don't have the right cards and I get wreck    Things happen  I understand  But from the many games I've played against her on ranked  I've almost always come out on top  Thanks to her  not many D Shifts are left  so less to worry about 
So contact the seller

Hello  I'm running my Vive on my ROG G751  980m gtx  and a 24GB of ram  Before you make up your mind about a laptop there is few things I would like to share  First you need to keep an eye of what kind of display output does a laptop provide  since all laptops have their own display you want to make sure the laptop you buy is capable of 4K output  My Vive didn't work on HDMI out  it worked on the mini display port    Second thing you need to watch is USB ports and how they are internal connected to the laptop motherboard  USB 3 have a very limited number of devices to be attached or you will end up getting the following error "Intel USB 3 0 eXtensible Host Controller   Exceeded Number of Supported Devices" Laptop internally connect a lot of devices on same USB hub  web cam  sounds card    etc   This limited the amount of devices you connect to your laptop  specially if your willing to connect external devices like printer or external mouse

When I was little I used to watch my dad playing the Resident Evil  Apparently  in RE2 when  RE2 Spoiler   s "Ada falls over the balcony"  I was absolutely hysterical  I was inconsolable for days   Most recently though  the only game that has made me properly cry is Beyond  Two Souls  The end that game set me off three separate times  I shed a little tear at Red Dead Redemption  Life is Strange and my second play through of frickin Journey  I have little hope for myself when I finally get around to The Walking Dead and TLOU

He cant fire you for your atheism  If you are a real employee   not just taking cash on the side  and he still fires you you can easily sue him   I know the concept of suing family seems shitty but kicking you out and firing you is way shittier   That all being said it is still best to wait till you have a solid plan in place

Well  you nailed the plan for the Oakland Athletics from 2012 15  Those great Major League players  like Vogt  Donaldson  Moss and Reddick  came outta no where  With the exception of Russell those teams   had no farm system    and we were worse off than the Angels and Mariners   Then Beane tried to go for it in 2015  and by midseason Forst and co  Realized a partial rebuild  as full as we could get without going bankrupt  was manditory  Which explains the Rich Hill Reddick deal  the Zobrist deal  etc

Old FWD designs like the original MK1 VWs have it in spades  and it's not so much the power as it things like unequal length driveshafts  weight distribution  the differential  the lack of active controls like ESC  and what not   My 84 GTI had a straight up full analog differential and would spin the left wheel like mad  do wheel hop under full acceleration  and would turn harder to the right because the left front wheel had more power   The right driveshaft on a MK1 VW is almost twice the length of the left   In theory it would have been easy to correct by having equal length driveshafts and a centered transaxle  like Subaru  but in an economy car with an offset transaxle like the Rabbit Golf that wasn't going to happen   This wouldn't have fixed the understeer but would have gotten rid of the squirelliness of the platform   In spite of this I still loved that car though  it was so much fun to drive   Everything was analog and directly connected to the driver and you could feel everything going on with the steering input and throttle

I have a favorite video that shows how evolutionary theory world and I think  u UltimateA aron would like it    It addresses how evolution works by showing what evolutionary theory predicts and what evidence we find when we go out and look for it  It doesn't however try to neccesarily debunk creationist claims  Edit  this deals with whale evolution  which is interesting because of how many different scientific disciplines are needed to fully understand the evolution of whales  Whales also have LOTS of fossils and vistegial organs which means lots of evidence for past evolution have been left behind    https   m youtube com watch v nBpdHVM1Sb8

West   North equals the time offset     The line the Sun set creates on the surface of the Earth is one big triangle going from the Equator to the North Pole and an another triangle going from the Equator to the South Pole   Cities the lie along the hypotenuse of this triangle will be separated by a distance north south and east west but still have the same sunset time   We could actually use these numbers to calculate the tilt of the Earth on it's axis  Take these two cities and find how far the distance is between them along each side of the triangle  a little bit of trigonometry and you have the angle

Yeah get a DNA test for the simple reason that many jews are barely jewish to begin with and are simply extreme shabbos goys from a racial perspective  but believe themselves to be jewish  Your mother may have been less than half jewish but still thought she was fully jewish  Many jews are like that  And it is enough to make them jews in our eyes because they support jewry  If you are under 1 4 jewish genetically and oppose jewry and support white nationalism  then you are one of us  Get a DNA test  I don't like to refer to NatSoc germany because it can come across as LARPy  but even there 1 4 jews  genetically  who were not jewish in practice or allegiance were allowed citizenship and were left alone  They werent considered aryans racially  but they werent considered enemies either

Im playing a paladin that pays homage to pelor  the sun God  He's very similar to solaire from dark souls  I followed the nature path  The other characters work well with me since I'm kinda the leader  But we've had some problems with killing werewolves but that's it  I've had to kinda work with my other players that became a demon but we were friends before hand so I was able to overcome that  It's a fun character to play  a lot of spell and healing abilities  Would definitely recommend

You realize that there's a  lot  of for women erotica  It's not all sappy and flowery  that's a massive generalization  Sounds like you were reading the romance heavy stuff only  which focuses on the romance more than anything erotic    Also  just because you don't like something doesn't mean it's lame

Thanks for the reply The7ruth    I was in front of him when he digitally purchased the new Final Fantasy  gears of war  and Borderlands  Handsome Jack collection   As I said earlier both the Microsoft store employees and a customer service rep confirmed it was set up correctly  Game sharing is very straightforward process with little room for error  
ghost really doesn't do it for me  it's catchy  sure but it seems to me that they don't really "live up" to their aesthetic  hoped they sounded a bit more like Behemoth or something    also  labeling them as metal seems a bit generous  hard rock  maybe

Disagree with the ost argument  it's incredible   I listen to it multiple times a day     My biggest nitpick is the loading times when fast traveling and such  and I'm not spending  100s for an ssd to reduce them   I would've liked fewer  more meaningful side quests   Fuck Dave  Sania  Vyv  etc   Wiz is cool though  since the stuff you do for him deals with chocobos  something people actually care about in a FF game   Others are pretty cool like the end game legendary weapons hunts   I'm ok with the hunts in general just because the combat is fun as hell   I enjoyed the dungeons  but the sealed doors were definitely a let down   Was hoping for more stuff to explore instead of a 50  room horde mode   I think they could've benefited from putting a scroll menu during battle for techs  magic flasks and weapons   I was def salty about ng    Pretty much no incentive to do it for me personally  as like you said the game is too easy as it is   Very nice post  it's a solid 9 10 for me too and I'm excited to see how they tweak it and how the dlc turns out   Also Happy New Year  D

Not necessarily  Different groups use different years to define "millennials"  It generally ranges from beginning in early to mid 80s to ending in late 90s to early 2000s  It's an arbitrary demarcation at this point

I think attraction is just a more situational thing in general  Like  I find some black chicks attractive and many unattractive  I find some white chicks attractive and many unattractive  I find some Asian chicks attractive and many unattractive  And so on and so on for as specifically as you want to classify people  Having those high rise 90's fitness hip hop video hips  the ability to do that cute scrunchy nose thing  and having a more expressive face in general matter a lot more to me than a woman's skin tone  Visual attractiveness is more about how a bunch of randomly assigned features come together and whether or not that "works" for you   That being said  and not to get to eugenic  but as someone who grew up as a red headed roofer in a never ending war with the angry daystar I'd be lying if I said the idea of my future kids having a shit ton of melanin isn't something that I dream about from time to time  
A way to really know how good players are would be   If supercell add "average number of wins" in challenges in "last 3 months" for example  people improve their gameplay over time   Then we could do a survey on that number ONLY for people who have at least tournament standard level cards for more than 3 months   Some people  like me  try wierd decks in tourneys  Challenges are more reliable since people have to spend gems

  Dragon's Dogma did such a phenomenal job in terms of combat  Did it really  It had some other good ideas  and atleast  trying  a real time action combat system is commendable for a Japanese game  but the implementation was godawful  Even games like dmc 3 4 could use  25  less hp on enemies to be more fluid  more perfect  but DD felt so incredibly grindy that it seemed like it needed 90  less hp on enemies  The grindiest korean mmos are paragons of pacing compared to dragons dogma

Exactly  At the core  you could go down to using nuclear decay for measuring time  and at the surface  you could say that nuclear force driven decay isn't dependent on space in any meaningful way   But for pendants of course  you'd then be talking about whether the organization of nuclear forces deep inside is also dependant on space  but that we just dont know at that level    I mean  at some level space and time are inextricably linked together in our 4d space time universe  and we dont really know how that linkage works beyond the planck scale  So we can only really talk meaningful about that at macroscopic scales  and there  I think one could safely say nuclear decay gives a measure of time independent of space 
that's nice

There are two separate accounts  One for Square Enix  and one for FFXIV itself  They are unrelated and you probably only made a square enix account unless you used the Mog Station   After you buy the game  you have to connect it to an account  Only then does your game time start  I'm fairly sure you could buy the game without activating it  play the free trial first  and then activate the game when the free trial is done  If you do that  just make sure you get the trial and game both from Steam  Steam and non steam versions are not compatible  and you'd have to make a new account

Honestly it is probably best to wait until the spoilers and see if the archetype is going to stick around  I imagine it will but a card like yahennis expertise can throw a wrench in the whole aggro strategy  Though I would consider R B more resilient than other aggro variants since it's also  has some control burn aspects  as it is the deck is solid and AER may even give us something else exciting to throw in the deck but it's probably best to wait

People don't seem to understand that capitalism is a civil war   It's consumers versus businesses  They will do whatever they can to separate you from your money  and they will put as little effort into it as they possibly can  They want the most buck for their bang  so they give you the bare minimum for what you're willing to pay  and then charge a little more somehow   As consumers  we want the most bang for our buck  That puts us at odds with businesses looking to sell us things  They aren't our friends  They aren't looking to help us out  They only want our money   Never  ever  ever take the side of businesses  Don't do it  They aren't going to take your side  They don't want to help you out  So don't help them out   Seriously  Bethesda does not care about you  They don't make decisions based on your happiness or well being  Everything they do is cold and calculated  and serves only to help them turn a profit   It's amazing that people are actually saying Bethesda supports modders  That they give us the ability to mod because they're such great developers   No  They don't support modders  They tolerate modders and use modding to help sell their games  That's it

i don't think someone who avoids getting into bar fights    even if provoked    is "afraid to fight" or a coward or anything like that  i think they're a smart person who realizes that fights  especially bar fights  are pointless and dangerous and generally a lose lose situation even if you "win "   that said  my SO could probably be provoked into a fight  he's much more level headed now than he was in his youth  and i think he'd do what he could to avoid it  but he's not afraid of it  well  we all have our weaknesses  luckily we are rarely in situations where he might be provoked

Thanks for the suggestion  I went to Staples and asked them to do that  The Manager said if they respond with a date before I purchased it he will take it back  He apologized for not just taking it back today since "I look trust worthy" however he can't just hand out refunds for every single use key game program they sell or their store would be repeatedly taken advantage of  So I might be making headway now

  In the significance testing approach of Ronald Fisher  a null hypothesis is rejected if the observed data is significantly unlikely if the null hypothesis were true  In this case the null hypothesis is rejected and an alternative hypothesis is accepted in its place  If the data are consistent with the null hypothesis  then the null hypothesis is not rejected  i e   accepted   In neither case is the null hypothesis or its alternative proven  the null hypothesis is tested with data and a decision is made based on how likely or unlikely the data is   Since biomes and nests exist  I wouldn't say it's significantly unlikely to have spawn points operate this way  It'd be nice to have "I watched x Pokestops for y hours and these are my results" or even "it can can't be possible because z" which helps either prove or disprove OP's findings rather than an outright "nope  it's RNG"   If I'm going about this the wrong way  feel free to correct me  but research should be more than just a "yes" or "no"

You will be tried and sentenced in the country where the crime was committed  Once your prison sentence is completed  if you are still alive  you will probably be deported   Some countries have treaties with each other to allow convicts to serve their sentences in their home country's prisons instead of the country where the crime was committed 
what i mean by good short range is if you had to actually use it for short range  you could  something like a shotgun has much better short range but little to no long range  assuming you are not using a slug or other longer range ammunition   what i am trying to say is that it is effective at all ranges within 500 yards ish

MGTOW and a lot of the manosphere  plus childfree  leads to anti white behavior by promoting miscegenation with Asian women  Because telling white men that all white women are bad and having white children is a bad decision just wasn't enough for them   They're not our allies  The white male Asian female problem is so bad here in California that we might as well let Calexit happen and give this place back to Mexico

1  There should be something in the hotbar section of the settings called the WXHB  That's another hotbar accessed by tapping L2 or R2 twice  You should turn that on  it'll be visible right above the regular cross hotbar so you can see your cooldowns  Alternatively  you can just plop a regular hotbar somewhere and put your cooldowns on that   2  You can change classes  but you won't be able to accept the duty until you change back   3  Just do it  The best way to learn how to tank is by trying it  and  you know  doing hall of the novice   4  Targeting system on PS4 is shit  And you should really move that back to the dpad instead of L2 and R2   5  What I do is start AoEing if there's at least 4 mobs around  Keeping your dots active on all the enemies is pretty decent for groups of three or less  but some people would just prefer if you focused down one target first

As was pointed out elsewhere in the thread  I'd expect the roster is signing with a larger organization  Though I'm just a speculating onlooker  I'd doubt AA would just drop a top 4 in the region roster unless something with more resources are stepping in

I've actually found Leo to counter Diablo pretty well  It's really easy to land your W on his fat ass and with a little practice Entomb can be pretty good at blocking the rest of the team from following up on a charge Apoc engage  To be fair my sample size is one QM where I was Diablo 
It looks super pink on me    kinda a shame because it looks so good on everyone else
One of the main reasons I came to PoE  From Torchlight 2  was the lack of traps and other stupid mechanics  I always thought they were a bad mechanic that was never interesting to play around  I know they're never going to remove lab but it absolutely makes me hesitate quite a bit when considering a new build  Granted 3 difficulties doesn't help much either but the lab is by far my least favorite part of PoE

Totally understand  I served six years in my country  Colombia by the way  and as some people know  we have a 52 years irregular war here with several guerrillas and paramilitary groups as other kind of terrorist groups  I used to be part of a combat and spec ops unit  the game is intense and is an stress relief  the last 28 november was my eight year of retirement and totally understand this post and feel related to it  sorry for my english  not my native tongue 
Just an assumption as an electronic module would not fail in thin air  lower pressure  
Not very beginner friendly though  The game runs on competition and has no campaign mode 
Exactly what I was thinking 
Maybe I'm just not cultured or something  but I was put off by the first sentence  I genuinely have no idea what you are talking about  That probably isn't helping you   Don't get me wrong  I like high brow writing as much as anyone else with a lick of intellect  but the beginning of your summary is not the place to try out poetry  especially when for most people it won't make sense  Stick with an easy to understand fact for fact format  and less of philosopher  Maybe save that for a section like "I spend a lot of time thinking about"   And finally  PUNCTUATION  As some other's have mentioned  grammar is hella important  There isn't much of an excuse for not taking the time or effort to not capitalize other than laziness  which isn't flattering in it's own right  It's not that hard  and it makes a better statement than not doing it

I've used a couple hundred incense in my time playing pogo  sucks to be rural  and since the event started I've used about 20  Starter spawns are increased from incense but across the board the starter spawn rates aren't dramatically increased  So if you're sitting on the couch just catching the 6 that spawn when stationary you have a decent chance of getting no starters  Currently I'm getting about 1 in 5 or 6 spawns are starters from incense  lures  and in the wild 
I started playing the entire Uncharted series when a bought a PS4 bundled with Uncharted 4 last October  I had a lot of fun playing the first three as each one gets progressively better  The plot seems kind of repetitive in each of the games  They look for treasure then they found out that said treasure could destroy the world   spoiler  but gameplay wise  it was one hell of a thrill ride    After beating the first three Uncharted games  I've started Uncharted 4  I was blown away by this game  The visuals are amazing  the gameplay is intense  and the story perfectly concludes the entire series  I have never enjoyed a more satisfying ending to a game since Ocarina of Time  I was pretty emotional once the credits roll  I know this a bigger impact to players who played this series since Uncharted 1  I also played this on HDR mode and this game keeps getting prettier and prettier   My time playing the Uncharted games was definitely worth it and I'm so happy that I had a chance to play it  As for Uncharted 4  it's a solid game from start to finish and it's why it is my game of the year

Actually  star  with his own chems gets 95 block shed  97 tackle  95 strength   He has higher ratings than Marcel almost across the board   When you put him in your lineup  he goes up to 95 base   Freaking beast  and currently the best DT in the game IMO

Manufacturing jobs now are standing 9 12 hours a day  often with a single 30min lunch break  You're doing boring  tedious  soul crushing labor all day and you can't help but think "in the next 10 years this job won't exist  A machine will be where I am  doing the work I'm doing"  You're paid barely above minimum wage and told "you should be happy that you're so lucky to have this job  You couldn't find anything that pays like that around here starting out " You have to sit through meetings where your manager tells you that unions are bad and useless  and that if the minimum wage goes up many of you will lose your jobs

This is all great advice  I'll add a few things here       Try to build the National College  in the Philosophy tech  as soon as you can  You need a Library in all of your cities in order to build it  Consider purchasing Libraries for your low production cities to get the NC faster      If you're playing BNW  make sure you establish a trade route with your capital to get a food bonus  If your capital is on the coast  use a cargo ship since that will yield a higher food bonus  side note  always use cargo ships if it's an option because they always have higher yields   If you build the cargo ship caravan in your capital  you'll have to move it to another city to do this      Once they're available  I forget the era   use spies to steal techs from your rivals    It's almost always a good idea to accept a research agreement when offered  unless you have to pay a hefty premium  which usually means you're ahead of the other civ in tech     If you build a city directly next to a mountain tile  then later on you'll be able to build an Observatory in that city  which grants  50  science in that city  Some mountain like natural wonders also enable you to build an Observatory    Don't improve banana tiles  If you do  you get a little more food and production  but you'll lose the eventual science bonus from jungle tiles  and maybe culture as well if you choose the  1 culture in jungle tiles pantheon

Oh I agree about the playing new builds and roles  It's one of the best things about this game and why I'm still playing    My point was that with them constantly increasing the gearscore it actively discourages that play style because you have to re farm gear for the builds every time they increase the cap

Some alternatives I've thought of based on your post   First variant  each player rolls their three  and then they bid for a target  highest bid  up to 24  wins  Players then roll their open fourth die  and make their keep give call  Like Bridge or 500 you need to try and make your target or lose your wager    Second variant  Like the first  except the bidding happens after the open fourth die but before the keep give call   Final variant  you roll a separate 4d6 and the total is the target number for the round 
Let's hope it does

Every single FPS game on PS4 starts easy  and becomes progressively harder as you play more  The real question is  do you like more tactical games where you'll have to think before you act  or do you like casual stuff where all you do is run around and shoot people while having no clue about what you're doing   If tactical  Rainbow Six Siege or Overwatch  I have played and loved these   If casual  Titanfall 2  Infinite Warfare  Black Ops 3  Battlefield 1 4 appear to be good choices

MTGO is the  most complete  digital Magic experience  since it has an impressively complete rules implementation  However  it's expensive  it has a fairly steep learning curve  and it can be    buggy  to say the least   Magic Duels is a stripped down free to play alternative to MTGO  It's simpler and more streamlined  but the cardpool is much smaller and the rules implementation isn't as complete   There are various unsupported  inofficial free alternatives floating around  such as xMage  Cockatrice and Untap in   Finally  there's  Shandalar  http   mtgsalvation gamepedia com Magic  the Gathering  MicroProse   a 1997 videogame adaptation that has a surprisingly fun campaign mode and some mild RPG elements  Because it's so old  the rules barely resemble modern Magic  but the game is a  ton  of fun  You'll probably have to do some digging to find a working version since it's abandonware

They do  Although dying from it would require you to chew the seeds to make the cyanide available  and if you don't  you'll just poop them out   I don't have the source available  but basically  the toxicity of amygdalin  which breaks down in sugars and some form of cyanide  is so that you'd need to eat chew  a cup of apple seeds for it to be dangerous

That isn't what she would do when she OUTRIGHT SAID "Not yet " As well as "Who says I'm done fighting " She just needs to take a break  but boom  life comes right back  and now she HAS to fight    Seriously  this isn't an issue  I've repeatedly explained why Blake is acting completely consistently  They've been incredibly hamfisted and anvilicious over her character  with almost no room for nuance or subtlety  and you're acting as if she has split personality   Again  "I want to rest  but I will fight because I have to fight" is not a contradiction  You're insisting that's her character when it's not  Even in Volume 2  she was the most proactive against White Fang  because she's trying to overcome her cowardice  That's the key thing  She thinks she's a coward  she's bitter about her Semblance  and she's trying to take on all of her issues at once because she doesn't want to be a coward   Sun had no right to eavesdrop  He wasn't like "Lemme knock on the door loudly and show her the White Fang mask " He wasn't like "Lemme wait for her to answer why she left her parents  which would give me the time outside to see the spy and go after the spy " No  he was like "I found her  lemme lean on the door to hear her  then break the door because it can't handle my body mass  and lie about what I was doing while trying to excuse my repeated invasion of her privacy " He's completely in the wrong in how he was trying to convey himself  and she's completely in the right for how she acted  beyond throwing the phone  but her anger even then was understandable

Your contrasting of Cook at Apple with Nadella at Microsoft is insightful  Cook is the immediate successor of Apple's visionary leader  Cook is a brilliant executive who concentrates on pragmatism  Microsoft also had such a CEO after Gates retired  Ballmer  Did anybody ever speak highly of Balmer  Likely not  Why  Because like Cook he was the executive successor of a visionary who lacked any vision of his own  Nadella is praised because he is also a visionary  Cool is reviled because he isn't  It's something of a curse  every visionary has a faithful executive behind them to make things happen  and when the visionary departs  the company or this world  the natural successor is the executive who shadowed them  The results are almost never desirable

If you're looking for something comparable to full power 300blk  7 62x39    A 300blk sub is pretty comparable to a 45  Super  comparable to 7 62    I guess if you were looking for something comparable across the board  I'd go with 7 62x39  Not sure about any factory sub being available  but handloaders could stick a 200  grain bullet in there  
The Red Bent was very nice   I stayed up til 1 30  not normal for me  but gotta watch the fights   Cody and Dom's fight was super   I love it when they bang it out    I watched World Series of Fighting this afternoon and the Justin Gaethje and Luis Firmino fight was INSANE  I can't believe either one of them didn't get knocked out  Hearing the hits they took I was sitting there with my mouth open   Crazy 
Good news     Thanks  Ur the best 
Alright  thanks man   Really enjoyed the story as Valk's my favorite card  Do make more

Divine casters in general have this issue  Cleric  Druid  Paladin    Ranger      They have access to their entire list  but they have to prepare a handful ahead of time   Honestly  the best thing is to let the players read through their list  read each spell  and decide which ones they would want to keep handy   You can't really hold their hands on this  unless you want to give away hints to the upcoming adventure by recommending spells you know they'll need  Or setting them up for failure by recommending spells they won't end up using  It's best to let them decide on their own

What I do is distance every argument from emotion  Your political stance for example  Many people are emotionally connected to their political view  It's important to note that someone disagreeing with them is not stupid  Nor are you incredible for having them    Unfortunately there is no definite answer to your question  It's something you learn to do after some time    Of course  there will be issues you can't help but become emotional  It's a shame but logically we humans are wired to have feelings   no matter how hard we act as if we don't

I believe that they have a 1 time return policy  You can return up to one mtx  no matter when you bought it    But if you were going to ask for the refund  I would definitely not say you want to do it just to buy it for cheaper 
Thanks  I have been thinking about doing that but I wasn't sure if it would just cause me to lose fat slower while gaining little no muscle  2000 would be theoretically 1lb  week as opposed to the current 1 5 2  so it would take about twice as long before bulking  or at least so I have been thinking  But I'm not an expert so I really don't know  Other people in the thread have said 160 is really low so I could maybe keep cutting to 200 and then recomp slow bulk from there 
Yeah  I'd much rather be here than working  They're talking about putting us up at another local hotel if they don't get it resolved pretty soon  I wanted to stay up there in the parking lot across the street  just to watch what goes down  but the SO said it's too cold outside  So we're hunkered down at her place  I'm still with good company  I can't complain

I think Watch Dogs 1 did it pretty well  the game wanted you do be careful around civilians  don't gun them down  hit them with your car which was difficult with the controls   or they're going to be afraid of you and call the cops on you more often  made the world feel pretty alive  Sleeping Dogs had a cool system too  where you earn Cop EXP and Triad EXP  you would lose Cop EXP if you killed any civilians or destroyed any city property on a mission 
I usually go Bumba's  sell for Deathbringer late game   Warrior Tabi  Shield of Regrowth  Jotunn's   Beatstick  Titan's I personally prefer pen on Ne Zha since he already has crit built into his kit and Shield of Regrowth really helps with ganks and catching up 
Outside of ranked no one cares if they leave in the middle of a match  I would say that's when most people leave games so it is very much a 5 more minutes game   5 Minutes turn in Civ 6 seems like BS too   A turn when you are at war can easily take longer than an entire CSGO match  And why would you continue to delay going to bed if you are in the down turns between wars

Neither Razer nor Corsair make very good boards  especially not for their price  The switch is probably the most important part  but there are a lot of other things  build quality in general  that Razer and Corsair don't really have  Older doesn't mean worse by the way  the tech in keyboards has basically been unchanged for years  and what was good even 30 years ago is good now   I don't know about availability or shipping prices in Brazil  but Ducky  Coolermaster  a Pok3r  Varmillo  Leopold  Filco all make good mechanical keyboards  A magicforce is a good option too for much cheaper  if you need to go cheaper for shipping costs  If you're able to get any of them instead of those three  it'd be better

thanks for the response  so basically when I went to school first when I was 18  i was a dumbass and didnt go to classes and didnt know what i wanted out of life or what i wanted to major in and ended up dropping out basically but i had a couple classes that had over a 2 0 in and the rest i ended up dropping from my schedule so i didnt have the bad grades on my transcript dont think   So i will have to turn in that first year of transcripts anyway and depending on what they look like i may not qualify for financial aid this semester  As for my tax returns i made less than 6000 dollars and  I have been a 1099 independent contractor so i never had to pay taxes because i made such a small amount

 The brain differences thing is mostly a myth or exaggerated  https   www scientificamerican com article how mens brains are wired differently than women   and the parts that aren't just made up sexist bullshit actually favor women as troubleshooters  men as spatial and coordination pros  Construction will favor coordination and strength  which are clearly more abundantly found in men  "Troubleshooting"  IT  is not a field built on some natural prowess of male logic    As for the rest  success depends where you place the bar  Is success having a job  Then yes  Id agree almost everyone can have success  Is success being financially stable  I'm less certain many people could attain that  regardless of work ethic  I've done just about every job from metal finishing to biology  and I've seen tons of hardworking people getting shafted on raises and promotions  from reasons ranging from racism to  most commonly  plain corporate greed and office politics

I'd say trucking is the best blue collar jobs to get  overtime 18 wheeler truckers can easily make more than enough money to feed the family   The jobs are not competitive  all you need is an A class driver's license   There are over a million trucking positions open    per month    http   advice careerbuilder com posts these are the most indemand jobs for 2016    Trucking is by far the most wanted job among the jobs with or without college degree   However  the job is tough  especially with during night time or having bad weathers  so not everyone are physically fit for the job

We have around 2 million active players  If everyone one of those players got 1m prayer xp  I think that's the amount of experience for 70   you'd need 8 000 000 000 bones  assuming they use altars   You also have people going for 99 or 200m xp thus the massive demand for dragon bones  The bones will always be at that price and will never dip under 2k because of their massive demand and very little supply

Not a full game  but W3  Blood and Wine made me very happy over the summer   There's a certain high that finishing Blood and Wine gave me that I'm  not sure any other game will reach   I came to the base game really late  Then  I spent months on playing it before I even tried the DLC   Blood and Stone was a blast  and Blood and Wine was a great cap to the game   It may have ruined me for other DLCs    TLDR  CDPR ruined me for other games   
It took me a few hours to determine that the Ishizuchi was not a real boat  but was the prototype for the Kongo class BBs   So what you said might not be far off

In single player games  when there's civilians that may be spared through my actions  I reload multiple times trying to save as many people as possible if I can   Unfortunately this had lead me to find when deaths are scripted and impossible to prevent   In those cases if the game is single player I alter the game so they can be prevented    The only exception so far has been the Saints Row series  While I try to keep my homies alive  I pay not much regard to people without the colors of my gang   In Gat out of Hell  since they are souls in hell  well  it's all fine and dandy  the more they suffer the sooner their punishment ends  Oh  and if I see someone smoking I shot them point blank on their face  No smoking in my turf        If they ever added civilians to online games like Counter Strike  I'd make it so there's penalties for both sides for getting them in the crossfire  such as cash penalties if you have to earn cash to get differentr weapons

IMHO Tim Cook was and still is more a COO than a CEO  A person who runs the company daily  makes strategic decisions about the operations etc   that's what he is great at   However he is not a visionary  a leader in a way we've been used to with Steve Jobs  He is too ordinary   boring  Is that a bad thing  That's a good question  Shareholders are certainly very happy even with less "wow" moments  depends how long it will last   Also I think many people  including myself find his presentation style boring and a bit forced  Since he became a CEO  I've actually turned a few keynotes off because how he presents  I agree though  that's a personal view

Green maylay usually lasts for a very long time  I do some Malay during the day  green bali in the afternoon and red Bali  Thai or Hulu at night  Smoke weed if that's your thing  Kava is wonderful  Be careful  It's a slippery slope  The longer you stay off subs the better kratom works  Actually if you'vebeen on subs for a while  it compounds and builds in your bloodstream and stays for months  Literally  One 16g dose of bupe has a 72 hour half life  When you take subs every day  you still have 48 hours worth of bupe in your bloodstream and it builds up  I didn't feel right for 4 months after subs  But it was pretty rad to feel the kratom work better and better  over that stretch of time  Be good  Happy New Years

That was a pretty sexist question dude  Don't just assume that because we're women that we're more emotional since society thinks we're all dainty little flowers  I've dealt with more emotionally unstable guys than women  being a woman myself  Guys seem to bottle things up and become somewhat explosive  if we want to go that stereotype route  They also tend to latch on hard and don't take rejection well  I've been called heartless because I don't express emotion all the time like I'm expected to  but I prefer having a logical view of the world over a purely emotional one  It might not get all the guys to call me cute since I don't put on an act  but it did help me find my SO who has very similar views to mine

Value of a degree is defined by the ability to get a job in that field  not whether the job itself is ethical altruistic    There's lots of degree that are morally valuable  but if all the job positions are filled  and the market is moving away from that field  it's not smart to go into it  no matter how just the job is  Degrees serve two purposes  finding a job  and learning interesting things  If you enter a field that only serves to teach you interesting things  but not get a job afterwards  you need to seriously think about your future before continuing

Not going to jail is good  but having a criminal record  a misdemeanor  will still effect you for the rest of your life  Even starting now  you will have difficulty getting financial aid  You will need to report that you have a criminal record to everyone who asks on a job application  or for a security clearance  or a housing application  or loan application  etc    You want to avoid this   Get an attorney representing you to hopefully prevent this from occurring  Often they can work out some sort of diversion plea for you  This is not something you could DIY  A lawyer needs to do this for you  You should   NOT   speak to anyone about this  especially the prosecuting attorney  Are you or are you not going to tell your parents that you need a lawyer   BTW     a Class A misdemeanor is a pretty serious charge  Not as serious as a felony  but almost   Also  don't listen to anything the cops told you  They were just shining you on to make the interaction go smoothly  They have very little to no input on what happens now  The prosecutor does

One of my jobs is a delivery driver  I get paid the same wage if it takes 4 hours as I do if it takes 8  For the same boss  I also work as a donut cook  If I finish in 4 hours  I get paid less than if I finished in 8  unless I stick around and deep clean the kitchen   It's all about the tasks you're given and the man who handles the paychecks  Some tasks have an innate time schedule attached to them  meaning task A WILL take about 8 hours  Many bosses will pay you the full 8 hours regardless of how long you actually spent  be it 6 or 10   so you have the incentive to work quickly

Omg I would pay up the ass for blinds and a welcome mat styled after this game  And a front door styled after a castle barricade 
Fellow attorney here  Keep fighting the good fight    Here's my embarrassing story  As a newish associate I had to run to court for an emergency presentation hearing  I didn't think to bring a tie or jacket to work that day  note  ALWAYS keep a spare suit in the office  so I got a scarf and tied it like a tie with my rain coat over it     The judge looked at me and said slightly puzzled "counselor   do you even own a tie  What's going on here   Gesturing at me suit    I about died embarrassment  I also made the mistake of telling my boss about it and that story still gets told around the office with many laughs  I'm the cautionary tale told to every new associate on why you need a spare suit hanging behind your door  
That's awesome  So I don't care about washers  but I can't help to be happy for people that are passionate about something anything  Good for them

that's cool  all words are made up  the concept is still "real" in the sense that there are people who believe in racial differences to varying degrees   do you consider people of other races to be inherently inferior to yours or no  doesn't matter who made the word up  or how the word is used now  or how nefarious the person who first thought of it is  or even how much it matters whether or not someone is a racist  if you had read my post more carefully you'd have recognized this  I don't care how little you think of the significance of racism

Well since you just deny what you can't refute  including the idea that human nature would have anything to do with this  I guess my arguments are null and I am wrong  
Maybe mechanic wise  but they M L games do not have the charm or the silliness of Mario RPG  The  Music  the art  the animations  all of it is amazing  The only part that's aged poorly is the simplistic combat which got worse in the Paper games    And the Paper games are trash  from combat  to world  to pacing  Fuck all those games

  if a few minutes of commercials are enough to keep you away altogether then you can't have enjoyed it that much in the first place    I'm old enough to remember when going to a movie was a real event  The theaters themselves were architectural works of art  and there was a 'respect' for the art of the film  Alas  now they are junk food selling operations with arcade games and commercials on the side  The movie itself is little more than an excuse to sell Coke and popcorn  and sell commercials    The irony is that the technology of big theatres is better than ever with digital projectors and Dolby sound systems  Nonetheless  to actually get to the movie requires running a gauntlet of the worst of junk product marketing  Movies  in my view  deserve better than the Cineplex experience   Thankfully  in some smaller towns  mine included  there are indepedent rep theatres that are worth going to for a quality movie experience  
I'm highly doubtful the Switch would be able to run   emulated   Wii VC games up to Nintendo's rigerous standards  As the Wii is a Power architecture based system and the Switch is an Arm based one  either the games would need to be emulated or recompiled  While most Wii games can be emulated on decently powerful PCs nowadays  the Switch is not this  The Switch will simply not be powerful enough  The Wii games on the Wii U were not emulated  they ran directly on the Wii U's hardware  as the Wii U's architecture was a Power based one that was very similar to the Wii's  I however can see Nintendo recompiling the games for the Switch's architecture and running them like that  Just like what Sony and MS do for PS3 games on PSN and select Xbox 360 games on the XBone

Your only option is to start at a community college and support yourself while you work your way through school   You'd need to earn enough to cover your living expenses and take out federal loans to cover whatever tuition costs you can't afford by yourself    A gap year won't help anything   You likely wouldn't  be able to support yourself and save more than a few thousand   You won't independent for FAFSA purposes until you're 24

It doesn't have a 1 shot kill range  thankfully   Even with headshot damage boosting attachments  the highest the multiplier can get in TTDM is 1 6  or 1 65  up from a base 1 3 or 1 35  I forget which  which results in 56 damage at close range with a headshot  Still a lot of damage  but because it's already a 2 burst at all ranges with one headshot without the attachment  it's redundant

I dunno why people say the game isn't "worth" full price   The game looks better than anything out at the time and even today on the PS4  That takes time  skill  effort  and a lot of money to do  Many games look half as good but play twice as long  so it really evens out for those who like really good looking games   For 1886 to be double the length would have cost more to make and not feasible to change for 60 dollars    I'm not saying the game is flawless but just pointing out the length being tied to the graphics

What kind of things will I need to work on that aren't obvious  In other words  what sort of things caught you off guard  or needed to be worked in more detail that you didn't initially realize   I haven't decided if I want to run this world chronologically or not  I could start out in part of the world that is already somewhat civilized and start in another for another campaign for those who want to do the civilization building part   I'll probably start 3 4 generations in  where local areas have been civilized and 2 4 races have already met and maybe intermingled  It makes it a little easier to get right into  especially for new players

Because there are many  many things that will screw up a cell's DNA  Cancer requires that a cell be suitably damaged in such a way that it divides endlessly  and it turns out many substances can inflict the sort of cellular harm that can lead to cancer behavior  Remember  it just takes one fluke  and you have a whole lot of cells that are constantly fighting to stay alive  Even the sun causes damage  Even oxygen does   If you look at how many people die from cancer  especially in old age  it becomes obvious that cancer is often a numbers game  The longer you live  the more chemical reactions have gone on in your body  including basic ones like sunburn  This means more chances for a few cells to go rogue  In the end  everyone fails that die roll someday if something else doesn't kill you first   Plenty of things cause good results to encounter  The trick is moderation  Sunlight causes our cells to make vitamin D  Omega 3 fatty acids promote healthy skin and hair  Many compounds found in plants are helpful  like resveratrol in grapes or natural aspirin in willow bark  Caffeine helps us focus and wake up  Red meat is a good source of easily used iron  You notice the things that give you cancer because they're scary

Basically  once you craft a certain Warframe  you can gain access to a new room in your Orbiter which infects the Warframe with a cyst that can be spread to other players' Warframes through contact  The only way to get rid of the cyst at the moment is to turn it into a pet  which requires a stasis slot and Kubrow egg and can only be done a week after contracting it  Furthermore  draining the cyst doesn't seem to give your Warframes immunity  so you can potentially get reinfected infinitely  Since the cyst is bright pink  it tends to clash with most people's color schemes

Do you mean you have no idea how to lane   Comments are right though  If you jungle you should know how to watch camp timers and ensure you're there when they come up  Laning isn't much diff  To get the max amount of farm you clear a full wave and then rotate into the jungle to clear a camp and then go back for the next creep wave    I'll give the advice I give everyone   watch pro streamers on twitch  Most pros play their role almost exclusively in ranked so if you watch enough games you can get a good understanding of how to play each role and also the meta builds if you pay attn to the items they buy  It helped me improve 10 fold in every single role

There are similar games but nothing that is AAA quality except for MAYBE Lords of the Fallen but that game had other issues  Nothing that's really gotten popular or broken out outside of PC     And Dark Souls is such an intricate game they can change seemingly minor aspects of gameplay but those changes still have a big impact on gameplay  Fans usually recognize the changes  Plus I don't think fans really want any big changes right now  we're happy with more of the same as long as the designs stay good
As a safety feature    The very first automatic transmission  GM's Hydra Matic  1939   used a shift quadrant that went N Hi Lo R  The selector range was changed to N D L R sometime in the early to mid 1940s   It didn't have 'Park' until later   The problem with this arrangement was that if you were in Drive and wanted to switch to Low but went just a little too far you'd end up in Reverse  which could destroy the transmission  In 1950 Ford released their Ford O Matic transmission  which was  as far as I know  the first automatic transmission to use P R N D L  or rather P R N Dr Lo   The idea is that it's safer if you've got Reverse and Drive separated by Neutral   This has been a Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard  FMVSS 102  since the mid 1960s

  I think you're misinterpreting a pocket audience's opinions to the entire audience for anime  Outside of its existence on Crunchyroll  and 2 3 posts on Reddit I wouldn't even know that it existed  meanwhile Re Zero is constantly everywhere in anime  gaming  etc   Possibly  But while it didn't get a lot of coverage on Reddit  and coverage in some of the more mainstream anime forums may not have been high  it was certainly huge in other areas  In the Crunchyroll awards  Re Zero has two nominations  but YoI has five  It topped the annual poll on Anime News Network  and was picked in the five top anime by 9 out of the 13 reviewers and topped their rankings  with Re Zero fourth  And it was certainly much bigger on Twitter and Tumblr that Re Zero   It may be that Re Zero was the most popular   which certainly wouldn't upset me  But it might be the case that YoI's popularity was with a different audience than those on Reddit  and it isn't clear if that different audience is bigger or smaller     I wish we had access to viewing figures for all the episodes   Perhaps the issue is that internationally the numbers of dedicated anime fans are still small enough that a popular "niche" show that grabs an audience outside of that group can gain greater popularity overall

My first save is at like 103 hours and the only things I have left to do are some hunts and the secret dungeon of hell  I've finished everything else and platinumed the game  My NG  has like 110 hours on it because I blasted through just the story as fast as humanly possible to show my girlfriend the storyline  she had watched a lot of the sidequest stuff on my first play  
I thought they recently said the Lancer would not fit through the small jump points    I mean  I would be beyond happy if it can still  since I own a DUR instead of an Aquila or Carrack  trying to force myself to certain manufacturers

Hey thanks man  Does doom 3 bfg have it  
A lien is for when you loan somebody money and get an interest in the property they buy with the money which isn't the case here  You are simply allowing him to pay in installments  The risk averse thing to do is give him the car so it's not in your name anymore then you would have to sue him if he stops paying  If it's still in your name  and he only has 100k insurance coverage and causes 300k in damages or kills somebody you could absolutely be sued for that

I live in a small town  15 000 people  and I throw away Pokeballs regularly   It is potions that I can never get enough of   Nearly every stop gives you 3 4 Pokeballs and you only seem to get a potion every 3 or 4 stops   My kids and I do a gym battle run every day and we have to cruise the small downtown back and forth for the stops to stock up on enough potions just for one day's worth of battles   So of course we get overloaded with Pokeballs each time   We have been throwing away great balls recently too 
I would go with SGT  CoS is very endurance based with no shops so what you find is what you find  However  that is also pretty cool from an RP perspective    If you have some Clerics and paladins it will be more than manageable  otherwise I think your players might get sick of constantly being out of potions

I have never actually played XBow  only mortar  but from what I can tell Xbow is more like beatdown on you side of the field  while Mortar is like hog rider    With mortar  you have to learn when to let go especially  as it is only 4 elixir and 2 hits makes it already worthwhile  If you opponent uses hog rider  a mortar in the center at the river hits the tower and counters the hog for an even trade    I actually only started using Mortar about a month ago because I thought it looked super different and underused  but because I've used it in every one of my decks during that time  I have grown to be quite good at using it  and even beat over leveled RGs on ladder  There are a lot of guides on mortar already  so if you search on this sub I'm sure you'll find what you're looking for  Good luck

i'm not gettin' the joke   
no  its a Dodixie annual tradition 
Just beat the game  so I'll chime in too   I really liked the game  and went in expecting the worst  I played FFXIII all the way through while drinking and having me and my roomates riff the entire time  I should've expected this would've been better  since FFXIV is transcendental  Better to be pleasantly surprised though    The biggest issue I have with this game is its lack of musical identity  Different strokes I suppose  I liked the soundtrack  though it was far more sparse and subtle than any other FF to date  There are very few tracks that switch between styles depending on the situation  which requires a different approach to scoring  I think with the game's open world nature  if they went to the usual "one basic track on repeat ad nauseum" the repetition would become quickly apparent  Normally SE scores per scene  but in an open world RPG  aside from the scenes that make up the final third of the game  you will experience repeated music more often  I agree the Chocobo track got really annoying really quickly  It could've done with more improvisation and alternate takes  I think there's only the one violin solo mid way through  they could've had four or five solo's and randomly threaded them into the song after a certain point    Fishing feels unfinished  and It's just not fun  Fishing blows  I never really got the hang of it  and I didn't pre order the game until a few weeks before release so I never got all the game breaking extras that makes fishing pointless  I could see where they were going with it  but it's so pointless  unfun and missing pieces  It would've been better if Noctis' hobby was a card game like in previous FF titles  That would've been easier to produce and stayed closer to FF games of the past imo    Photography could have been amazing    how about letting Noctis point and shoot with a reticle   Actually  I really liked photography  I didn't need to  nor did I want to  move the camera myself  And after around level 5 6 Prompto's photography gets a lot better  I was seeing more and more shots that actually looked good and were funny  On top of that  I never headed out of a town at dusk  I was usually pulling in  So I was always asked in the early morning to pull over for a shot  never ever at night  Maybe you just had a bad run of it  I think the focus on photography added to the game for me  and I was expecting it to be pointless  It's not as if Prompto or Gladiolus' secondary abilities mattered too much more either    Most of the tech abilities will never be used  Ignis has the most useable  and Gladio deals the most power   but Prompto even as a support character is awful  and underused   I didn't put too many points into the Tech abilities  but Prompto's Starshell helps out considerably in the end game when there are daemons every god damn were  Starshell then attack daemons from behind for extra damage  Or Starshell plus the ring ability that voips enemies away    I found one of the most frustrating things about this game was the inability to swap between magic tech abilities while in battle   Honestly  magic should've been taken out entirely or re imagined  In essence they're elemental grenades that you need to use as openers or closers  I really wish when you used a grenade the AI didn't make Prompto run headlong into a raging fire  Manually aiming would be better  but the game didn't help when enemies will just run you down at the speed of light anyway  As for quick changing  why wasn't magic selection handled through the tactical menu  Maybe making down on the d pad the magic only option  and being able to swap out spells in L2  Easy fix    Travel in this game is pretty sloggy  and the cars handling mechanics are like being on slippery magnets  The car felt really slow getting out of Lestallum for some reason  but other than that I found it to be ok  I wished there was more banter  dialogue or options when driving than there was  Honestly  I fast traveled each and every time I could  only letting the auto drive ride if there was something worth stopping to do between my location and the final destination  My bet is that originally you could never manually drive  but the option was added in later to make the game feel more like an open world    Lets not even go into the loading screens  NG  is absolutely pointless  as it doesn't scale the difficulty whatsoever   Yeah  you're better off with your end game save dreaming and completing the content  Though it feels sorta pointless  aside from getting all the things I guess  Anyway  face Adamantoise  It's a bitch    This game is too easy  It encourages you to sidequest  but unless you do every story mission at estimated level  you won't get a challenge   I guess that's what the Noxperience band is for  I didn't mind the lack of challenge  since it was never about how hard I was hitting the enemies and how generous questing was to giving me health restoratives  Which I appreciated because healing is sorta fiddly    The weapons have no enhanceable abilities  traits  or sockets   Vendors had shit for weapons  but I appreciated that over the usual FF way of each and every town for some reason has marginally stronger weapons that you are forced to buy  The wearpons I found questing were better  and I never had to get the end game weapons anyway  Didn't even know where to find them  Weapons are pointless compared to gear    THE BLATANT ANNOYING MMO FETCH QUESTS   I went ahead and did just about every quest I could and I think the questing sort of ends at the right spot  It was starting to get annoying right around the time when I was seeing less and less to do  Now all I have is adamantoise and powering up the weapons with Cid    This next point is a large one  They seriously need to reprogram how the AI spits their lines out  They are downright terrible in repetition and don't even make sense half the time   I could go with some code that puts a line on hold for a good hour or so before you hear it again  I also really wished there was a conversation continuation system in place  Too many times would one character start to say some plot important line  when someone else interrupts them because we walked too quickly and Prompto saw a pointless thing to talk about    Most of the "advanced" dungeons are all the same  minus the top tier ones which are a grindfest unlike any other  It seems like this game really doesn't present a challenge until the very last 1   and when it does   it's ridiculous  No spoilers  but if you make it there you will see   I don't know what hard end game dungeons there are other than the sewer dungeon by Insomnia and the one that only opens up at night  Guess there are more that are hidden  I dunno  due to how the game is laid out they were annoying more than challenging  Either having monsters constantly curb stomp me  or being a drain on my restoratives    Why can't I use Aranea or Iris in my party  They are coded and work during parts in the game  even in NG  you can't permanently get them  I have a feeling like this is Square waiting to release even more characters as DLC  which bothers me   Probably because that would require even more banter  time and money to produce  Imagine the low amount of repeated lines that are already in the game  and double it      If you've made it this far  tell me what some of the things that bothered you while playing this title  Bitching aside  I think the combat is the most well done part   it just needs tweaks   I'd say it needs a lot of tweaks  Eventually I "got it"  but everything felt too fiddly  First off  the camera is shit and needs to be scrapped and re programmed from the ground up  Enemies need a better system to telegraph attacks  and the block needs to be re worked too  since half the time the little Square warning sign came up with no follow up enemy attack  Warp points need to appear in each and every combat  no exception  and a cancel animation option would be greatly appreciated  I would also re work magic  either making it something only Ignis can do  or increase the number of spell styles there are  Maybe making straight up healing spells  debuffs  buffs  single target  multi target  etc   Also  I dunno about you but the MP3 player worked fine for me  I could use more variety in towns too  Oh yeah  and why does Chocobo racing suck  Also  explain the goddamn story better  I know there's a lot of shit going on  and it'd be great to see it  Also more outfits  And outfits for people who didn't buy the game five years before it released  Also  more scenes like that one time when Prompto opens up to Noctis on the roof of that one town and you really get to know him and his character  Why didn't I have that for Ignis or Gladio 
Ah that's good that it's fixed  or hopefully   I'm surprised they didn't fix that bug  I remember reading about it at launch  Oh well   I think you might have filled up for real though  Only 3 of my accounts were left though  so you should be okay for now   Good luck farming

In the 'Arena Commander' game modes that this guy is playing  when your ship explodes a prompt appears on screen to Press X to respawn     If you get catapulted out like this guy  you need to suicide self destruct first  I believe the key is something like RightAlt Backspace    Then the prompt to Press X appears     In the 'Persistent Universe' death and respawn controls are the same  but you get your ship by interacting with a monitor on the space station you spawn at    When ships explode in this game mode there is a timer before you can respawn your ship  It's the first Super basic implementation of the insurance system bringing a new ship to your location

5e  So we have an odd campaign  we rotate dm's  and we have ancestral weapons that make us a bit OP  Basically weapons that get bonuses as we level up  So my cousin is a warlock  and his arcane focus is a part of his sword  through time his sword has become  3  He keeps trying to argue that because his sword is  3  his spells sting rolls get  3 to them  The sword is  3  does that mean the arcane focus is  3 also  He could've picked a materials pouch instead  he wouldn't be able to argue the  3 for that   He says that dnd is about changing the game to your groups liking  but I feel like he's changing the game to benefit himself  So now I'm questioning our weapons  wondering if his is the most OP of all  which I think it is   But anyways  what are your thoughts on a sword that is  3 giving you  3 to weapon attacks and magic attacks  The sword does more  I forget what  but just that part seems way more op than my rapier that's  3 that I can switch with another weapon for a BA instead of just an action

As far as I know  only actual SAVES are permanently saved for you to go back to  Quick and auto saves overwrite each other after a while  in my experience it's 4 or 5 quick or auto saves before they overwrite    So I would say if you want to permanently save progress create an actual SAVE file    P S All caps on save progress to make sure there was no confusion during reading 
Gyarados is a really easy way to get a 3k pokémon  Get a Lv30 Magikarp with decent IVs  evolve and you're immediately in the 2 7 2 8 range  Power up a few times and boom  Even if Gya is double weak to electricity the idea now is to take the gym to Lv8  so it takes real time to take down  And in that system the higher you are the longer you'll survive  Not to mention it's so easy to prestige against Gya

The lightning port plug is reversible but the cable is not  it has an A side and a B side   The rest of your arguments are excuses using the "good enough argument" which is not what we are discussing   We are talking which port is superior and USB c is better than lightning in almost any metric you can measure

  1  Delivered content that the community been begging for   SRL and Icebreaker     2  Did not require silver to enjoy the full event   Looking at you Festival of the Lost this year      3  Surprised us with how fun Strike Scoring ended up being          1  I'm glad for people who like SRL  but I personally couldn't care less  Played the minimum required to grab the tags and rewards then bailed out  4 maps are not enough  physics are unpredictable and sparrows are all the same  except two    As for the exotics  they are horrible imo  More examples of rehashing of the existing weapon catalog  Nova Mortis and Abaddon are lazy copies that are worse than their arc sibling and will have a really hard time owning their exotic slot  The Icebreaker case is a sad one too  a once revered exotic that has been so good it was taken out of the game then brought back a year later as a shadow of its former self after countless nerfs and put behind a lazy rng wall      2  I agree completely     3  Strike scoring is a good addition no doubt  but I just don't think it changes much in the grand scheme  People are paying attention to the scoring in the nightfall only because they are looking for the IB  and as soon as they do  or lose interest   nightfalls will be speed run again or thrown aside  Scoring is probably even less impactful in regular heroic strikes as people usually run those for keys  chests and exotic engrams         All in all  I think the Dawning was    ok  not great but certainly not bad either  It's miles ahead of FotL and CD  but the bar set by those is too low to consider the Dawning an achievement  My personal wish  however improbable it may seem  would be to make live events target the size of the last April update which had significantly more meat on it imho

Cristiano has had a better career than Ronaldo  However  as a United supporter who loves him  Cristiano   and has followed his entire career  I can confidently say at his peak Ronaldo  the Brazilian  was the best player I've ever seen    I don't think I've ever seen a player as electrifying as he was in his time at Barca  and it's a testament to his ability that even after an injury that would have ended the career of many lesser players  Ronaldo went on to have a career that can only be classified as world class    All that said  history will judge Cristiano as the better player due to the longevity and quality of his career

Liberal spin at work  The federal government did in fact say it must be implemented      Mr  Trudeau essentially told premiers to adopt a carbon tax or cap and trade plan or Ottawa will impose its own levy  a minimum of  50 a tonne by 2022  and return the revenue the provinces   http   www theglobeandmail com news politics liberals to set carbon price at 10 a tonne in 2018 rising to 50 by 2022 article32206937    And  carbon pricing is not the actual cost  It's a cost made up by bureaucrats  a cost that is impossible to accurately measure and a drag on the efficiency of the economy  and it doesn't reduce emissions       But BC Ministry of Finance budget documents show  clearly  that total demand for the B C  carbon taxed products grew faster after the carbon tax was introduced than over almost every other similar timeframe between 1992 and 2008  before the carbon tax was introduced   Further  B C s official 2013 Fiscal Plan expressly forecasts that  in spite of the carbon tax  B C  demand for the carbon taxed goods will grow another 8 6  by April 2016  while the population is expected to grow only 1 2    http   business financialpost com fp comment carbon pricing doesnt work   The most we have ever reduced greenhouse gases is through the  Montreal Protocol  https   en wikipedia org wiki Montreal Protocol  in 1989  It reduced GHG by more than all the initiatives since combined  We need to keep working at behind the scenes solutions like this  like the October 2016 amendment for HFCs  to reduce GHG not feel good sunny ways carbon taxes that have little actual effect

Harkon's offer is the branching point of the Dawnguard DLC  If you accept  you join the Volkihar clan  If you decline  you end up with the Dawnguard  The rest of the DLC plays out pretty similarly    you hunt down the same plot trinkets  but the details of how and why are a bit different  The real difference is the sidequests and magic  The vampires sell some necromantic healing spells  while the Dawnguard has some special anti undead magic   You also get additional opportunities to become a vampire lord later on even if you turn Harkon down  but it will also make you persona non grata at the Dawnguard fortress until you cure yourself

You target what's in your graveyard not what you sacrifice  The creature on the board that you are going to sacrifice is not in the graveyard at the time when you're casting victimize    I'm actually confused about what you're asking to be honest  Because the loose wording that you're giving to "sacrifice target" which in itself is not actually a thing    I am assuming you have abyssal gatekeeper on battlefield  and creature A and creature B in the graveyard  Target both creature A and B in the graveyard with victimize  then victimize resolves  and you sacrifice abyssal gatekeeper  A and B will be on the battlefield and then abyssal gatekeeper's ability will be put on the stack  when that resolves you will be required to sacrifice a creature  A and B are creatures you control at that point and you can sacrifice either one of them

What would really go a long way is having each character have a personality    Look at TF2  no storyline  I mean a vague one in comics that's somewhat deciphered  but the characters have enough personality to build it's own story lore 
I'm being lazy and don't want to search to see if someone else mentioned it but your comment about running prey reminded me of it  Humans are hands down the best at endurance running  we can run longer than anything  we are just slow in comparison  But I guess you could argue that in our beginning it was better to have endurance than speed  since most predators can only keep top speed for a fraction of the time  Can't run faster than the thing that eats us  but if we can put enough distance then we lived to die another day 
Sherwood Park residents generally don't agree   They feel the rural country residents profit off the economic benefit their pretend hamlet provides   Which is ironic because  as shown below in example  Sherwood Park is also viewed as a leech on Edmonton

Be careful with these things is all I can say  I've put chews into every kratom order I've ever had  so have literally hundreds around at all times  They're so addictive  I ended up with a mouth full of cavities  It's been awful  They just stick to your teeth  and the rest is history  I've slowed down on my chews intake since  but regardless  yes  they do rock  
Yeah  I just don't    get the game  It plays awfully  
That feeling when you manually rev match so perfectly you have to look down to check if you didn't put it in neutral instead

If you're talking about the one where blocks lift and stuff  it wasn't necessarily a puzzle as to where to go because there's only one way to go each time you do it  You just had to do it 4 times

Destiny   I actually held off buying a PS4 and waited for the white PS4 bundle specifically for Destiny   Beat the story of the game  which was nothing special  over a weekend   And then at max level there was literally nothing to do except grind    got frustrated after a week and haven't touched it since   I know the game is much better now  but in order to jump back in I'd have to drop another  60 for it   I'm still bitter about the first time I bought it  so the thought of giving the folks at Bungie another  60  after they burned me the first time leaves a bad taste in my mouth

What's your level now vs when you were first chasing starters  
The best thing about Amagi on high tier matches is that everyone seems to underestimate it for some reason  It's actually really tanky when angled well and the guns are fantastic  Ships like Montana  Iowa and Yamato tend to ignore you because "you're only tier 8" and broadside you or angle against something they perceive as more dangerous  but Amagi's guns will easily citadel even a Yamato if they broadside  She fires enough of a broadside that even an AP salvo will give a lot of Destroyers second thoughts too  and her secondaries have fantastic firing arcs forward    I think really the only other BBs that give me pause in mine are Izumo and North Carolina  because both tend to favor a bow in strategy that can make it difficult to deal with them  I've also had a few issues sometimes with taking out Bismarcks and Tirpitzes that decide to angle away from you and retreat  but it's probably just that I tend to continue to fire AP when I should be loading HE sometimes 
God  I hate that sub

People want it to be true  It makes Jean Grey a much more interesting character if it is true  Which is why it's probably not  because Marvel can't write for shit   There's an edit of her fighting Karnak where they make her try to make him gay  only for him to flick her in the forehead saying "No Jean  you're gay"  Made me chuckle

What I've found is that eve lacks what other PvP games offered  a chance at fair equally matched fights  99  of fights in eve are about ganking or using a counter to win the fight before it's even started  Ganking and this playstyle is encouraged in eve  whereas most other MMOs fair fights were considered honorable   In other MMOs  the "character" was often equally matched which meant more skill intensive fights as the battle progressed  Not so much in eve with no skill cap and things like high end ship mods and boosters 
I heard the plot is loosely based on Marie Antoinette
They're enthusiasts enjoying their Eve how they want to in a perfectly harmless and reasonable way  leave them the fuck alone  Op is the real cringe for trying to put people down for how they spend their time

Of course  I get that point  The thing is  we must differentiate between trash heroes and situational heroes  though  as they're not the same  Devoting some time to a learning a situational hero can be a good investment once you have already a roster of more versatile picks  Maining situational heroes is a different story  though  and I am personally guilty of this with my most played Illidan  P

What makes a lot of languages difficult is a lack of accessible media people   Take for instance English   It's very easy to learn for a lot of people because there is a huge amount of resources available to practice with   It's easy to find and talk to a native English speaker compared to a less common one   Since you already have access to native speakers you're able to surpass one of the biggest barriers in learning a language  practicing it and actually using it with people who already speak it

    My  24 M  Girlfriend's F 21  Grandfather  M 82 may be in danger from his new spouse  We need advice    This is a long and convoluted story but i will do my best to explain          I will refer to the grandfather as Jim  Jim lost his wife to a stroke 5 years ago and remarried about 9 months ago  His new wife "Linda" is much younger  mid 60s  She seems very nice and is very charismatic  Jim on the other hand is very hard of hearing  pretty mentally sharp but otherwise what you would expect of someone in his 80s             Jim is also very wealthy  his late wife had a large life insurance policy and left Jim everything  with nothing going to his children or grandchildren  Jim has in turn wrote his entire will  including many family artifacts to Linda             Since their marriage  strange things have happened  Jim's grandson was living with him since he is still in college  Linda demanded he move out  a few months later  her 32 year old deadbeat son was able to move in rent free  Now that doesnt sound suspicious  shitty but whatever  Jim is on a a steady dose of medication vital to his health  Linda claims to be a natural health nut and tries to stop him from taking his medicine    A month after  they were in an accident  Linda was driving  She ran a redlight and rear ended a vehicle going 45  According to Jim  he was wearing his seatbelt but it mysteriously became unfastened right before the accident  Jim hit his head hard on the windshield and wanted to go to the hospital  Linda refused  Jims daughter  Jamie  had his power of attorney and when she got to the scene of the accident was enraged that Linda was trying to keep him from the hospital  Jaimie told Jim to go to the hospital and that was that  A week later  Linda tells Jamie and the whole family that Linda now has power of attorney                Jim has not said anything about abuse or anything like that but myself and my GF's famil feel this woman and her son are evil and trying to kill Jim  We feel powerless to stop her and powerless to prove anything          They are not concerned with the money or the artifacts  they just want him to be safe  He is oblivious of any wrong doing and thinks she has his best interest at heart          Is there anything we can should do             tl dr  GF's grandfathers Jim  new spouse Linda  made sure the will be put in her name  since then  bad things have been happening to Jim  Power of attorney got changed to Linda after a suspicious accident  We do not know how to help him  as he does not feel anything bad is going on  We are afraid for his life

I agree  but to be fair I've also lost games because people try and rush down the core and fail instead of just taking a second and maybe third keep  especially if we have all our keeps up  so taking 2 of theirs is a huge advantage  and 3 is an almost insurmountable one

Thanks  Clay   This is a very excellent list   Items 3 and 4 ring especially true for me     I too was a naive TBM who assumed everyone around me believed the same I did   I had no idea how much variance there is even among active Mormons  and neither do they   The church has a vested interest in not clarifying tough doctrinal or historical questions because people will be shocked to discover nobody has agreed on those questions for decades   In addition  a common thread I've noticed in almost everyone I've met who has left the church is that the fact that it is false overrides any community or fellowship that membership could provide   For me  and many exmos like me  it is more important to be honest and not pretend  lie  just to stay in the club   For many people who stay  however  staying in the club is so important they won't even let themselves acknowledge any possibility that it might all be made up   I don't think they're dishonest  it's just that their affinity for remaining  in  the group is so strong  they cannot even comprehend something that might challenge that

Clinique used to sell this powder foundation that came in a little box you twist to freshly shave the powder before each use  but they discontinued it    I'm still working through my stockpile of it   I very rarely use foundation though  maybe only a couple times a month   If I need some heavier coverage  I've discovered that I quite like the Covergirl Clean Matte BB Cream  in Medium Dark   I think it only comes in 2 shades though  so I'm very lucky that one of them actually matches me really well

As a new player you honestly probably don't need extra tabs at all   When you want to get in to more serious trading or mapping  pick up 3 or 4 plain tabs  or the bundle if you want more than enough   It'll give you room for 3 trade tabs  a tab for currency  a tab for cards essences  and a tab or two for maps   Currency tabs are nice but ultimately all they do is save you a few seconds of organisation after you're done running for the day  There's almost no reason to buy premium tabs when there are tools like Acquisition or Procurement that offer hassle free shop keeping

Nicely stated  Clay   I like the point you make about staying in the club being the goal of many people  that is so true  I think many BIC people are conflicted because it's their identity   I can understand that being a very difficult thing to shed or move away from   
Yeah  there's a grocery store in my area that's similar  That and the local coop are where highschool students dream of works  Good hours  cool staff and better pay than half the college students  It's a great deal  but there's nothing quite like watching a younger sibling with zero work experience snag a job that pays more than your "supervisor" position does    
He can have you now on his lvl in a short time but for a short time  or he can have you later and for a longer time   This is one of those things that needs to take time since the information and world can be pretty daunting from first perspective    You have gone into the game and said you liked it  He should take it from there and maybe try a different approach  If you go into the game feeling a critique hovering over your shoulder then that will soil it  If he can be your Gandalf Guide   it will be quite different   
Cineplex has so many things that rub me the wrong way  Remember when they raised ticket prices by blaming increased minimum wage the same year they had reported RECORD profits  They're now introducing VIP lanes and a bunch of other garbage  Corporate interests are at an all time toxic high    Speaking of commercials though  the worst is when they show you cut scenes of the very movie you're there to see  SPOILERS MUCH   Fucking ass hats  They all do it  Landmark Cinemas also  This needs to stop    I've been at some Cineplex cinemas where the audio was calibrated and setup so poorly that the explosions literally hurt my ears  I'm sorry but when the audio is distorting my inner ears you're ruining the experience    rant
It is THE argument  WAR is heavily skewed towards the pre war period  
I'm an inclusive hippy and even I think the Olympic Committee's rules are shit  By their standards Fox is perfectly eligible for competition  The real problem is that because trans women competing in professional sports is still very rare and heavily stigmatized we actually don't have a good set of data or even basic information that could be used to setup a framework for them to compete  Fox's T levels are going to be lower than most of her competitor  but there's obviously concerns about bone density and fast twitch muscle response  So rather than go "All trans women can compete against women " Or "Dudes can't just wear a skirt and fight women " We should be looking at establishing fact based rulings to determine how an increasing community of athletes can fairly compete

You have the fastest and tankiest ship on T7  ridiculous AA that every carrier wants to avoid  and torpedoes that can easily decide brawls for you  The firepower is the price you are paying  You need to aim well and stomach that even that won't always be rewarded   Gneisenau is a ship with a relatively low skill threshold  While better players of course do better with it  bad players can get decent results with it as well  which is why it has the best T7 average stats  bar Scharnhorst  but premiums usually tend to do a little better because of their player base   If you are looking for a T7 ship with a higher skill payoff however  you might want to look at the Nagato instead   The Gneisenau is a great ship to queue with carriers by the way  If you got a friend who has a Saipan or a regular T7 CV  you have  perfect grinding buddy

You know the interesting part of ignorance is that it encompasses the term ignore   While it is not directly part of the same etymology  I've always thought that the two words are pleasantly inter related   In your case  you are ignorant because you actively choose to ignore  In truth  of course  there's another phrase for that   wilfully ignorant  The etymology of ignorant is really just to not know   Know   gno and all that   So we should be clear when we use words  shouldn't we   You are not merely ignorant  you are  wilfully ignorant   http   rationalwiki org wiki Willful ignorance 
It's motivating to me to go to the gym when I've got per session  weekly  monthly  yearly  and multi year goals  YMMV    For me right now  I'm definitely not going to stop being super weak unless I go to the gym  There's a goal   Another  better goal would be I'd like to DL 4 plates and bench 2  I'm pretty close but if I don't go to the gym  I'll lose progress that I've fought to win  so there's no question about whether I'll go or not

Im 5'6"  When I graduated high school  I weighed 120ish lbs   i had been so busy doing everything and anything I could at school to earn scholarships  My girlfriend had even said I looked emaciated   I spent my freshman and sophomore year just putting on weight cause I hated being smaller than my girlfriend  When I got to 145  I finally felt human   I weighed around that until  four years ago    When I turned 30  I started lifting  I found a passion for it  And a connection achieving goals   My first goals were simply to add more weight again  I wanted to weight 165   Then I could focus on strength and get to my first goal of one day bench pressing 225lbs once  You see those guys in the combine repping it out like its nothing  I wanted to do it just once    This year  Ill be turning 34  my bench goal is 300  really 315 cause I want that third plate      What Im getting at here is that I too was in your shoes   I too was weak  skinny and down on my appearance   Finding that drive and passion and setting achievable goals has kept me pushing and growing    Stick with it and your inner strength grows  so too will your muscular strength

This song is what got me through my junior year  A lot of crying  fighting with parents and suicide of a friend led to this song on repeat on long drives up the canyon to clear my head   This and their song Dance Music  They came to town that summer and my brother and I stood outside for an hour trying to get tix to the sold out show in the cutest tiny venue  We got in and had a great time in the sweaty hot garage singing along to Hail Satan and other songs  but when this was performed I definitely had a good cry

Never listened to Tyga other than rack city but I was really feeling this song when I listened to it  Ye kinda goes in 
It's true   Christians were persecuted in Japan between the 16th and 17th century   some of whom were crucified  https   en wikipedia org wiki Martyrs of Japan    The wrathful  jealous  and angry Biblical God claimed that he would "visit the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and the fourth generation of those who hate me "  It is also made clear in these texts  that vengeance belongs to God  not to man   So your grandfather is wrong in terms of his reading of the Bible   More importantly  Christians believe that "God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world  but in order that the world might be saved through him "    Further  according to Christians  Jesus preached forgiveness for those who sinned against us   And yet  this goes back and forth  with many contradictions   As atheists  we can't make sense of it 
Good point because other teams' fanbases don't have that  
cassettes are by far the cheapest  and most fun   form of music collecting  yes they sound like shit but they're just fucking tight  new vinyl from an artist    20  new cd from an artist    12  new cassette from an artist  when applicable    usually around  7  thrift stores have massive boxes of tapes hidden away because literally nobody cares about them  you can find hifi decks for less than 20 at the same stores  it's the only way to get some flashy futuristic ass gear with crazy design and random sensors that you don't even understand without dropping hundreds of dollars  yesterday i picked up the miami vice soundtrack  a tape of sailing sounds  and a collection of "island party music" for less than a dollar   also your friends' parents will just give you their old collections once they find out you're into tapes  it's cheap as dirt   oh and i forgot about tape labels  they're fucking rad  last time i bought a new tape i got a handful of candy  four stickers  a business card with some cool art on it  and a handwritten thank you  you can't get that shit anywhere else

What repo do you use to get     tweaks 
  nothing more then repetitive actions over and over for all aspects of the games mechanics  You've just described every game ever   Including SC  because there is very little to do currently   Only epic games like EVE  GTA5  WoW  etc have soooo many different activities that repetition becomes less of an issue   SC may have publicly scoped that large  but it's many years away until it'll be on the same scale as those games   ED has player to player interaction too  when the instancing bugs don't mess up  thankfully fixed in the current beta   and will gain four role multicrew in 2 3 expected at the end of Winter  Group warfare is already active in game  with passionate PvP factions  not on the scale of EVE of course  which is the granddaddy of PvP

I've banned myself from using ultra balls for non final evolutions and from using greats on anything with less than outstanding cp for this event  outstanding being  anything higher than my current highest cp over 80  for that individual species   I encountered a high level CP Blastoise today which depleted my Ultra Balls  so I know I made the right decision there     I don't think the starters in the event are any worse than they normally are  but is that because my expectations are lower because I'm only using pokeballs   The Santachus seem harder to catch than the starters    I've stopped bothering with them now

It was a joke  as he said that people are playing PS3 PS4 
Makeup for TV is usually a bit different from every day makeup  I think they use cake makeup  at least we use cake make up on stage in theatre  You can recreate the look quite well   I use Ben Nye cake makeup for the stage  but for every day looks  I personally start with moisturizer  apply a silicone face primer for all day hold  a liquid foundation and a fluffy round brush to apply a setting powder  in nude  I use a brow kit and angled brush to do my brows  Then  I use the cake Navajo Sand by Ben Nye to put right where the natural shadow starts below my cheek bones and overlay a rose blush just above it   I take dark brown Ben Nye shadow to line the outside of my eyes only and finish with a  shimmer highlighting powder to go over my cheek bones  jawline forehead and nose  I make sure I follow the natural shadows and highlights of my face and then finish with mascara on the outside of my eyes  It looks pretty natural and the "hot girl disguise" stays on all day  
Doom for me   I love everything about the game  at least the single player   The gameplay  art direction  graphics  sound design  and music are sublime   Honorable mentions      Attack on Titan  which is fun despite being so simple  relatively monotonous  though the different playable characters keep it from getting stale too fast  and it's pretty easy before you unlock True Attack Mode   True Attack Mode makes the game much more difficult and while it still doesn't capture the overall grim tone of the manga and anime  it's much closer than anything in Attack Mode     DoAX3 for actually being an improvement in terms of the volleyball gameplay and the addition of Owner Mode and Excitement Level makes gifting suits from one girl's collection to another girl less of a timesink compared to XBV and especially X2  X2 would take at least a year to do everything if you devoted your entire spare time to just that game   though it is still held back by being a glorified tech demo like the other games in this series and is sorely lacking in terms of activities compared to XBV and especially X2  and while the soundtrack is surprisingly good for being in house stuff  it's just not the same without How Crazy Are You     Legend of Heroes  Trails of Cold Steel 2 for being a solid and fun RPG   It's basically more of the same gameplay wise as the first game but better in every way  especially since there are more than 2 Divine Knight battles  so if you liked the first game  you should like this one too     Senran Kagura  Estival Versus is an improvement in every way over the first game  and as a wise man once said  "Tits are life  ass is hometown "    Valkyrie Drive Bikkhuni is very similar to the Senran Kagura Versus series  and I like that series  so this was a no brainer for me     I'm also having some fun with Dead Rising 4  but they've changed a lot with the game and it's just not as fun as the previous games and the exo suits have too short a duration   Edits  Formatting  added a couple games

At first  I was really confused with the kuva siphon mechanics  I was a burden to my teammates  because I literally couldn't do shit  I couldn't stay in Operator mode for 5 seconds and my dash seemed to be 5 cm  it seems that I would aim for some sort of lip in the ground without noticing   I'm certain that people that came here and in the forums  complaining about leeches  I was possibly among said "leech"   Now that I know how to do it  it's very simple  I learned how to get in and out of Operator mode long enough to disarm the kuva guardians and not get rekt  while also keeping an eye out on the kuva clouds   Unfortunately  you took the words out of my mouth  the spawning of the siphon can be  very  painful  Sometimes  it spawns in such place where the guardians stay in another floor  usually occupied with the mission's factions  infested or corpus   while you can safely keep an eye out on kuva clouds  Most of the times  it's in such a tight spot  it's hard to look at anything else other than those fat fucks   Eris' maps are the greatest culprits of this  I forgot how many times I failed a kuva flood because the siphon spawned right on top of a hive and the clouds would appear  exactly  next to it  There was zero time to react and the guardians would murder our operators before we could do anything   I don't think it's a terrible farm  especially after you get used to it  I thought kuva farming for me was 100  done  but after a little practice and watching how people do it  I can do even the floods on solo perfectly  without losing a single cloud  However  these spawns really need to be checked out  Some are ridiculous

Of course racism being defined as "in group preference based on race" exists  That's what every race of people practice  It's only Whites who are expected conditioned gaslighted to not practice racism  Hence the "racist" slur  That is the entire objective of the term  to keep Whites from practicing in group preference

Of course  I will when the news breaks  I don't even know if his family knows yet  I've called his closest friends myself  but it's getting hard after only a few   I've only known for 6 hours  and I was probably one of the first  There's an ongoing investigation  and all that too 
Unless you have particularly complex and technical needs  e g   trusts or     estate planning   do not trust or work with anyone you meet in the financial industry who is looking to advise you or manage your money    Almost all investment products you hear about are a sham designed to confuse overwhelm retail investors with too many choices to create the false perception that you need a professional to help you navigate this purportedly complex web of products   In reality most of these products just go towards generating commissions  fees  and hidden fees   to compensate overpaid workers in the financial industry   In general all you need is one ultra low cost equity index fund  e g   SPY or Vanguard Total Market Return  and maybe a small allocation to a similarly low cost bond fund if you are more conservative  and the desire to save a little every month       Let your assets grow and compound and never sell a single share except to fund a purchase of real estate for you to live in  pay for kids college  or until after you retire and need the money to live on   If you are selling one investment to fund some other investment that someone recommended to you  that makes you the sucker   Every time

You need something with more of a pinky tone  I can tell from your skin tone on your neck  You don't really have a warm enough tone to need a warm foundation  Either try a neutral or pink tone  you could also mix foundations until you find your perfect match  And color match your neck too  that's the most accurate way of testing without having to do your whole face everytime

I have no affiliation with Cineplex  I'm just sick of people whining about movie ticket prices  which actually haven't gone up much in like 15 years which  I'm surprised people are still bitching about it  I remember the tickets went up to like 10 13 dollars in like 2000 when Silvercity was new on the scene  They havent even really gone up much since then  Is 13 dollars still a lot of money to people   I would honestly pay  20 to see Star Wars or Avatar and not even bat an eye  It's some epic entertainment experience that's worth every penny  I would pay like  40 to see Avatar in 3D IMAX  That shit was fucking insane 
Honestly I think you just need a good idea  Personall I'm an aspiring comic creator  and from what I've seen there are more than enough people looking for a good comic to read  Heck  I'm one of them  I'd love to read something that didn't occasionally stop to tell me I'm a bad person for not doing more to help trans lesbian orphans  
I   Know  I didn't say anything like that  White babies are in higher demand in Canada  where I live  I assume the U  S too  
In addition to damage scaling  also think about your loadout  If you are getting overrun with enemies in certain missions  trying using a fusion rifle and machine gun instead of say a sniper rifle and rocket launcher  Obviously you're limited by your weapon choices at this stage in the game  but try messing around with things  because there is no one loadout that works for ever scenario   Also  since you're a newer player  make sure you're capitalizing on your abilities  I've seen some new players treat the game like a pure shooter and never use their supers  but you don't need to save it the end of the mission strike etc  All of your abilities recharge pretty quickly  and will charge much faster when you get better gear   so get in the habit of using them a lot   And FWIW  some of the missions are just hard to play solo  By all means  play the way you want  but know that you will be essentially locked out of a fair amount of activities just from playing solo  For example  the Nightfall is the weekly strike challenge is definitely something you'll want to do to earn loot  but it's designed to be played with a fireteam of 3  Plenty of people do solo it  but it's not going to be easy  and some weeks nearly impossible

All I want to say is that no I'm not disappointed  besides wishing certain characters got a little more screen time but they're restricted on time so hey what're you gonna do  Also that tweet you pointed out really has no relevance  It's not like the person running their twitter account has any say in the creation of the show  it's just some social media person tweeting out random shit 
I know  It irks me a fair bit when this happens  because one loses a lot of precision when discussing things  especially when contrasting how racist politics were employed by the various different strains of fascism  and in this case it actually matters  though I'm starting to wonder whether even fascism is applicable here  There's so little detail about the administrative practices and political theory of the Galactic Empire that it's a bit muddled whether it is a fascist regime  or just a generic authoritarian dictatorship

So you just genuinely like re playing the same content for the same gear every patch  Cause if you're into that and you really love the mechanics world something about this game then I could see it being a dream having some flimsy reason to replay everything   I understand playing to attain the new levels  What I'm against is playing the exact same content you have been for the past 3 4 patches for the new levels  There's only so many times you can run Lexington before you really hate Lexington  Personally after this patch I was fairly sick of having to cobble all my pieces back together again  and if 1 6 was gonna set me back to having to grind out all my loot for a 4th time playing the same incursions and missions I did for all the previous loot  I was probably just gonna not play 
Just started doing the alternate accounts so  I'm pissed 
I heavily dislike using heavy caliber on dex sybaris due to the accuracy penalty  It still obtains 51k burst dps with shred instead of heavy caliber 
I know  She is 21  which was a red flag for me  wanting kids so early is never a good idea  I have family that did that  and it did not work out so well   When she said her mom had cancer since like the 90s it made a whole lot more sense
I find it hilarious that ignorant people  who are just bigoted against Latinos  rant about "illegals" taking their jobs when it is far more likely that it is the legal H1B workers being brought in that are actually taking Americans' jobs   That shit needs to be cracked down on

 abortion stuff  God I hate how feminists portray this as evil men vs poor women  Pro life vs pro choice is orthogonal to gender  Both sides are evenly split male female  It's almost as though there's some other issue totally separate from gender that's causing the controversy  Couldn't possibly fathom what that might be    even when women have control of their lives  men pop up  Who'd have expected so many interactions with a group that makes up 50  of the population 
Personally  I prefer it not because I dislike the visual but because it's tough to find visual porn which doesn't contain huge turn offs  The acting often seems absurd to me  and half the time I'm cringing going "annnd that would not be pleasurable " Not to mention the terrible sounds and camera angles  It's obvious that a lot of porn is made with male viewers in mind  eta  though a lot of guys probably hate those shrieks etc too   And it becomes even more difficult finding something hot to me when I start looking for kinks    Written porn is just so much easier  There's a lot written with women in mind  so it's easier to find something which suits your kink and your style  Whether you like hard and fast anonymous sex  or something softer and more romantic  there are options  And no awful acting  surprise weird camera angles  or shrill screaming to make me cringe    So  I prefer written porn over visual more for the ease of finding it and for the benefit of not dealing with surprise turn offs partway through a scene than any other reason

It's relevant if he could have a segue into his thought process  OP is talking about 2 smoldering stones in a task and then that guy comes in with a loaded topic he wants to discuss simply because of the location his picture is in   Yeah it's    relevant  but not really  Relevant in both topic's aesthetics  but not in substance  Literally all he had to do was preface it with "Jeez  packed in Neive's cave as always    I can see why people crash   " and then go into it  even then it might be a little rough   Just going for it is like being that guy that talks over someone else's story because they want to talk  It's like someone discussing a piece of art's history and painter only to butt in with "why does this museum have the layout of a hairy ass  why not put paintings near the front of the hall "  Relevant  but not really

  Sorry  I don't have time to type everything in to google and look for "facts" that aren't even accurate  Not liking facts doesn't make them inaccurate     Besides there is way more search engines than Google   And simple statistics would dictate that trends on Google would be similar to the trends on every other search engine

Oh 
Clear speed meta is a meme  Every game like this has always been based around clearing as fast and as efficiently as possible when it comes to the "best" way to play  Luckily  it's a largely single player game  so you can play whatever builds you want to   I like to play builds that kill bosses super fast and get to run around with movement skills  so that's what I do  If you don't like those types of builds  don't play them

I thought Rangers had a set spell list    And yeah  I try not to help with the choosing process  I guess what I'm looking for is some resource to give them so that they have easier access to the spells without poking through the handbook all the time 
It's not about that  imo  It's about job market saturation  If the market for sociologists  historians  teachers  etc is saturated  and there are no positions that need to be filled immediately or in the next 10 years  then perhaps that degree isn't a logical choice for expecting a job afterwards    It's not that people think those jobs aren't important  it's that there's no jobs to be had in that field  as there are no vacancies  This is the situation for a lot of STEM fields too  depending on where you live  and those aren't smart degrees either  It's not "anti arts"  at least not for me  it's "anti no jobs in that field"   No matter what degree you do  there will be challenges in your learning  It makes me sad to see people struggle through school and not find a job because their degree isn't in demand  and it sucks  but it's the way it is sometimes

  Divine casters in general have this issue  Cleric  Druid  Paladin  Ranger    They have access to their entire list  but they have to prepare a handful ahead of time   Rangers don't  actually  in 5e anyway   They have a small number of spells known  similar to Arcane Tricksters or Eldritch Knights

Okay  I thought I was a nerdy RPG player for playing those games the way you described  Glad I'm not alone on that  Really adds a lot to each play through for me  and like you said  extends the replayability   The only gripe with Skyrim I have is the immense power your player wields almost immediately  The mods aimed at immersion and realism have largely remedied that but the base game would have been better with a world that wasn't so ready to suck my metaphorical dick  
  what i am trying to say is that it is effective at all ranges    if you had to  These two things don't go together    You "could" use it at short range  but it's not effective at that range  It can do the job if forced to  but there are guns that are significantly better at that    Hence it's not "effective"  It's still "useful"  but not effective      but little to no long range  "Long" range is 700  yards    Shotguns aren't useful at 100  yards even with slugs  no  but many people have difficulty hitting moving targets beyond 200 yards with iron sights anyway  
Probably not

I do appreciate that it's 21  it really cements the connection between the dice game and blackjack  the concept of not going over busting  Easier to explain  Also people irl around me often say "let's play 21" instead of blackjack  so it would be easier to remember the bust number with that association  Although    we're such nerds    
I'd advise never hunting red chinchompas  Instead  capture red salamanders until you can hunt black salamanders  then trap those until black chinchompas   Rather than going to capturing red chinchompas during peak times  due to large numbers of PKers at blacks  as others would suggest  it's better to just train other skills and go to black chinchompas during quieter periods

Ehh  orally  or perhaps plugging  will be a better route   2C B burns very bad  2C's are literally the worse thing I have snorted  Indeed you do start coming up in 5 minutes and peak maybe 45 minutes to an hour in  The pleasant body buzz isn't as noticeable and it feels a bit shallower when snorted  Also i couldn't get past the intense burning of my nose and hard come up until peak  Finally once you settle in after the peak  it seems the the trip is just starting to wane and will be over in another hour  Not enough reward for snorting the material  I have only tried it with 2C B HCl  but have heard HBr is better on the nose

i do something similar that i learned on some cooking channel    turn the jar upside down and slam the lid flat against the counter  to be fair  it is a lot louder and more "violent" than some of the other methods  so i try not to do it in the middle of the night  but it is MUCH FASTER and much more effective than the other methods i've seen

For people commenting it's not traditional or authentic  I would like to share my opinion from little experience I have being an assistant in an Indian restaurant in the past  Chicken tikka masala  the dish itself has debatable origins  While the curried form is today attributed to originate in UK  if we look at the name  tikka is the meat or vegetables roasted cooked on skewers possibly came from the Mediterranean or middle East and then the masala though it is a misnomer  the type of gravy prepared for this dish possibly originated in the Mughal times  Whether it was in India or the UK where they invented this dish  it was basically a comfort food mixing those two concepts  Thus this dish doesn't have a traditional cooking method like some other mughalai  lucknowi or peshawari dishes  In fact  even in traditional Indian restaurants which commenters refer to  I've seen each one following a different method of how they marinate  when they add the meat to gravy etc  So in my opinion  this dish too is authentic  Looks yummy   Though I turned vegetarian after I left food industry lol

Wing Attack is flying  which is Super Effective against Exeggutor's grass type  Charizard's best moveset is not pure fire like Ninetales and Arcanine  Against ice  bug  and steel defenders  fire fire would be more effective than flying fire  Though to be honest there aren't any popular defenders that are those types   Lapras is ice water  which fire is neutral against since the fire is super effective against ice  but water resists fire  so those cancel out

"We thought it'd be nice to support Intel i7 owners because they're awesome" was the only obviously PR bull explanation I saw  They reversed it which is great but they've never provided a remotely provided a good explanation beyond reading between the lines   Intel gave them money to do it clearly   Of course  all that should have nothing to do with winning the award  GOTY shouldn't be based on public opinion of business decisions regardless of how justified consumer dislike for them may be

In the case of bar fights  I would only condone physical violence if it were absolutely necessary in the process of extricating himself  or anyone he knows  from the situation  As you said  they   and any fight   can cause serious physical injuries and constantly being in fights is not a badge of pride to wear  I'd much rather prefer trying to deescalate the situation and leaving the area if necessary 
Completely agree  I have pretty much exactly the same story here  yay for no starbucks coffee eating up my gaming money   I've spent around  500  mostly on the Black Friday deals  Pulling is much less worth the money than TM farming   However  I will add that having done those 10 1 pulls is what got me enough units to make it worth macroing my TM farming  For example  those 10 1 pulls got me my Miyuki  Zidane  Chizuru  Cecils  etc   in addition to my one great pull of Gilgamesh  and their sweet TMRs  Without those pulls  I was farming Ribbons  Ultima   30  Mag  and Black Cowl because those were my best TMRs  While decent  they are not game changers like blade mastery and dual wield

On the other end of the spectrum  I dislike bounty hunt and amped hardpoint the most   I often play solo queue  What drives me is good performance  just good competitive nature   adding to my MVP Top 3   It frustrates me in amped hardpoint when I'm competing for MVP with someone just staying in a hard point for the majority of the match  Bounty hunt is less frustrating  it just feels like most people don't understand how the scoring works  Sometimes luck is  a factor of who you run into and if you happen to beat them  Just my gripes with those game modes   However  the stat tracking being kept for personal view is fine for me  I don't care if the KD is shown on any game type other than PvP  I do like everyone having fun  because it's a blast

If a big part of it is computational cost  does that mean it's possible to naturally generate a synthetic voice  but not in real time  Like even though it only takes a couple seconds to say "Hello  nice to meet you " that you could generate a naturally sounding voice clip of that phrase in a few hours  Assuming of course that all the necessary context was understood as well

That's extremely dismissive  and I can do the same to NV    NV is a very hollow game  A majority of the NPCs are just clones of one another  and  they had about the same amount of lines as they did voice actors  https   www youtube com watch v SSUEE e8a0I   You talk about how FO4 was nothing but action  Well NV could have used some of that as you would run into maybe a rad scorpion and two raiders if you were lucky as you crossed large barren lands between point A and point B  Not to mention the combat was clunky with terrible AI  There was almost nothing to New Vegas itself as well  You had the outskirts that had a shop  a couple of greasers  must be those heavily story based characters you were talking about   and a makeshift hospital  The city was what  3 casinos  a mostly empty tower  and NCR base  The streets we empty save maybe 2 hookers  some NCR  and a random fodder NPC here and there  But sure  all of that is made up for some skill checks that instantly solved quest  Skills that were otherwise arbitrary aside from the hard points you needed for a perk  I could go on and on if I wanted to  which I don't   I love NV  but this is the only way I can make a point about this topic  I think you and a lot of vocal people on Reddit do this thing where you're hyper negative on the new releases while giving the old ones a huge pass  Yeah  I miss the skill checks and I think having a voiced protagonist limited dialog options  but game excels in just about every other category from mechanics to world building  It has weaker roleplay in some aspects  but stronger roleplay in others  Sneaking through the warzone that was the streets of Boston as a glass cannon scout was very immersive and really made me feel like my character  Same with the mechanic character I made with the focus on base building and the robo DLC    If you really didn't like FO4  that's fine  But I really hate this negative absolutes when it comes to discussing the game  like it's some universally held opinion  People like FO4  and it isn't because they are simple  new  or don't know any better

I'm comparing the entire Surface lineup  that is every Microsoft computer they brand and sell  to the Mac lineup or the iPad lineup  Whether they're buying it because they want to use macOS or because of its industrial design is completely irrelevant to my argument  More people want and are buying iPads and Macs  If Apple had launched a business that did as little as Surface in revenue  it just may be labeled as a "mainstream flop" 
Doesn't matter if you're earning it or not  Would you take a job making  3 hr  Probably not  because you know your time is worth more than that  My point is that if you have to stop what you're doing  whether it's socializing or reading a book or baking a cake  in order to move a coin to your coin jar  then you have essentially made the decision to work ten seconds at a rate somewhere south of  5 hr  You get no benefit from moving the coin except its monetary value   Kind of silly example  yes  but properly valuing your labor and time has to start on a micro level  Your time isn't worthless  and there is a cost to "saving" that coin

I've never taken kratom while sick  but I know opiates always helped when I had a cold    and I mean aside from the opiate euphoria just making me feel wonderful   They always both suppressed my cough  opium  codeine and or hydrocodone have long been in formulations prescribed for coughs  and cleared out my sinuses as good as any decongestant   If opiates do it  I would guess that kratom would do the same

  i should have gotten a written statement saying that she would not pursue claims against me and exchanged info  but i didn't   Even if you had thought of it  no person in their right mind would sign such a document on the side of the road immediately after getting hit  Not infrequently  injuries appear days weeks after a car accident   If they didn't ask for your information  you are probably fine  But if they did take down your license plate and you get a letter from them or their insurance company  tell your insurance company so that they can handle it  If the police come to ask you questions  refuse to answer except in the presence of your attorney  and then go get one

It would work in a controlled PVP ONLY environment where you could Matchmake and see what the other team agents are using before the match starts  Also you're refering to things that have been fixed months ago that makes no sense  Patch 1 4 was balanced and PVP was fun all we are missing are PVP only game modes  All those broken things you refered are all and only fault of Devs in Massive that don't know what they are doing  It was not hard to understand Reclaimer would be pure AIDS before they even introduced it in the game in 1 3 and so on  Problem is that the people that introduce this things to the game don't know their own game or have ever played something similiar  Was it that hard to predict that Uncomplicated talent   AB would be OP  I mean it's plenty obvious

I think it's better to knock it down as close to 0 prestige as you can get it  They don't know who did it  and yet teams can mop it up if they want  especially lower level than Trainers  The same team would also have to actually prestige it back up if they want to keep it  rather than being able to get it up to level 3 immediately without any work involved  They still dot know who might have done it  so the retaliation factor is still there  Much more frustrating IMO

That's a great thought  I kind of forget what the game is capable of now and I've looked at raids like  "massive boss sort of like KQ stat wise  imagine 20 blowpipes shredding through that " But as you pointed out  thoughts like that are likely worthless  
Nope  However  you could  if you wanted to  fire your guns in increments  adjusting between each shot if you're still zeroing in on your target  But really there's not an actual difference 
Do you mean that no indies released this year lived up to your standards for a top 10 or that no indie game ever could make your list because it's indie    If it's the latter  that seems like a strange and arbitrary restriction  Like what budget in dollars does a game need to have before its content is worthy to be placed on a top 10 list    It just seems weird to exclude "indie" as a category  as that term can be used to describe so many different kinds of games that it becomes pretty meaningless  
Apparently not haha  The reddit hivemind has decided otherwise

Microsoft is a low bar  They are sort of in the periphery of everyone's attention  and anytime they manage to do anything half competent  everyone is surprised  It's easy to speak positively of them when expectations are low or non existent   Apple is a high bar  Everyone expects the best from them  They are the standard that everything else is compared to and have a long history with devoted  critical users  They are more scrutinized than any other technology company  So there is a lot of criticism out there of Apple and their products   That doesn't mean people hate Tim Cook or Apple though  It would be wise to discern the sincere and thoughtful people that criticize Apple from the "woe is me" trolls that think Apple is doomed and that Tim Cook should be ousted because the latest MacBook Pro didn't have enough RAM for some subset of users or whatever

They are ok ish  but can be really wonky  I'd say the main problem with the bis' guns is that they're a bit too unreliable when it comes to accuracy at medium   longer ranges  They can still do stuff  but everything can do stuff up to their max range  It being effective  however  is something different altogether

My husband and I were laughing about the strike scoring since  when doing regular strikes  everyone has learned where you can just hop  skip  and sparrow past a room of creatures and where you need to fight before the next area becomes available   But now scoring per kill and bonuses for kill type is in the mix  every single area is cleared out before moving on and  once the area is cleared  it's a race to the next area to see if you can wipe out the room before your strikemates get there    P

Not really someone who's ok with changes when adapting something  but in the end it makes sense    So       I just hope they don't cut Kiyo and Liz from Orleans  and I'd also love if they give Jalter more screentime     Lev's "death" being more humiliating and painful    I wouldn't mind if they edited out Blackbeard     Some scenes depicting Mordred's method of investigation       And for them to not make the Indian Bros' fight too long

I had a major accident in Ontario in 2003  and decided to go car less for 10 years instead of paying high insurance premiums  When I got a car again in 2013  my driving and insurance history was perfect and my premiums were low 
Yes it would  The relevant rule is      117 7c  If a cost is reduced by an amount of colored mana that exceeds its mana component of that color  the cost's mana component of that color is reduced to nothing and the cost's generic mana component is reduced by the difference   This rule is very difficult to invoke  but it can happen    Khalni Hydra       sphere of resistance     9 or more green creatures   Sphere of resistance increases khalni hydra's cost to 1GGGGGGGG  that's 8 green and 1 generic  and then khalni hydra's ability sees the 9 green creatures and reduces the cost to 0

"I'd take a set of Continental DWS all seasons all day over some random unknown winter tire brand "  That is what you said and I replied to  Nothing there says to look at tire rack  You said because you don't know a brand you prefer an inferior tire that you do know  Chinese knock off's aren't real  All tires sold need to be DOT certified and meet a high set of standards    You get them because they are highly rated by a very well trusted testing company and the blizzaks are not in stock  Not rocket science here    No  your no seasons do not beat even mediocre real summer tires when they are on a properly equipped car  Don't forget they fitted your car with prius tires to intentionally let it slide around because it lacks the power to do so  So your car comes improperly equipped for what it is from the factory  Don't project that inadequacy on other cars  as virtually no other cars do something that silly  The DWS only are better then your factory tires because your factory tires are shit on purpose    Also how did this become about what you put on your car  This is someone else asking for what snow tires to get  your needs don't come into play here  I get that you like tires that are mediocre in all situations and aren't really good at anything  but geez man  calm down a bit  I don't like them  and if you can go on about your love for them  I can point out they are actually shit  It goes both ways    Also if you buy your tires at a place  they usually swap them out for free as needed  I have never once paid for it outside the first installation  Try using a good shop next time    All seasons are used because people are cheap and lazy and don't want to do things the proper way and instead want a simple  if worse  solution  They have let marketing teams tell them that something that is mediocre at everything is somehow better than having to go to the tire shop twice a year  Tires are a safety device and saving a little time and money should not be more important than having the best equipment you can  Some people see that  you don't

Dude I'm on PC and trust me  the day before they moved it it had 1000  searching them literally the next day it had less than 100  People are dumber than you think  For example out of 7000 people  0 are ever searching for CTF  the main competitive gamemode 
It's pretty good  most smgs are pretty good for range  they don't need to be able to hit insane cross map shots  just good medium range  There's a lot of times when you have a shotgun you'll find yourself wishing you had an smg  mainly if you're playing bomb   
That's beautiful

Maybe I was mistaken about that then   I'd thought it was 30 for some reason  Still  the bigger the discrepancy between tickrate and framerate  the more 'off' PvP is going to feel

ok then that 400k can for sure go other places because I am going to do the solos for those players   I think I will end up with the 92 favre as well   I know he doesnt have the mobility as McNabb but I couldnt stand the mcnabb card last year   Thanks for putting this together man   You have cards in that lineup I didnt even know existed lol     I loved the Fleener card last year   Do you think thats a viable option   He has better run block than Graham and Clark with kind of comparable recieving stats     But the chem masters from solos should open up enough coins that I can fit in a Sean Taylor OOP   I know using that many coins in one spot isnt ideal   But on a user  I really want to use that card as a user   Maybe to help me out or idk haha

  The Game and Services are only available to individuals aged 13 years or older   That part is the 'hard stop'  None of the rest amends it to allow anyone under 13 to play  It literally says that unless you are at least 13  the game and services are not available to you  Are you thick  Huff a lot of paint  Think lead paint chips are tasty

Imo if you're ever going trans  crit is better than quin sais  also ur getting ichaival really late into that build where ur opposition has probably already started into crit    Just build him like a normal adc but with trans  The reason you wanna get crit instead of quin sais is  ur high power doesnt benefit quin sais wheres a crit would  You could go trans warrior OR ninja tabi asi wind demon deathbringer titans bane  You could replace trans lategame though and get another crit item like malice  replacing trans with another crit item is pretty common unless you're some1 like nieth   I prefer getting NT with a trans build cause you're so far into the early game without AS and 20  AS translates into the lategame much better than 20 extra power   Another build you could do which is more high power and pen would be trans ninja tabi asi quin sais titans bane o bow  With that build you could focus down tanks and ur AS is so high that executioner might be overkill for the AS  Golden bow is great with trans builds and can deal a ton of damage in a teamfight  its essentially like another half crit item   Titans bane is better for ability based hunters like ullr over executioner because your abilities will benefit from titans bane pen everytime  whereas with executioner you have to stack the protection shred on some1 BEFORE your abilities and autos can benefit from it and with ullr  you're pretty long range  so titans bane is more favourable

I think you're okay  honestly  Nothing in that story was morbidly embarrassing  Bizarre at worst  I think  People will forget it in a few hours if nothing crazy happens 
Take your time too  Don't rush  cause in hurry you will just throw some balls away  Patiently wait  mons usually fight back 2 times  some even three times   I'm also using option to flee from mon and click on it again  but be sure you are still in range   In most occasions that helps to catch it faster   I figured out that if your trainer is moving cause of gps drift is harded to catch mons

not really   It didn't even get to the top of the subreddit   It's also only a PC issue as there is no chat on consoles  and u can mute block report people for voice chat    I'm sorry I just don't see why a company like ubisoft would want to put the money and effort into dealing with this   I completely agree that it sucks that people do stuff like that but you can't always control everything that people do

Exactly  if I even consider having kids I'm absolutely never going to do it unless I  110  positive  that it's what I want  It's just plain unfair to the hypothetical kid to do otherwise   Nah what I've started saying is that I'm too selfish and irresponsible to responsibly have children  but luckily I'm responsible enough to realize that and selfless enough to not do it  Then I walk away while they're figuring out wtf I just said 
They are though man
Yeah  especially after dealing with the catacombs

My tips for fishing would be getting a variety of lures  few you can pick up lying around fishing spots  but it's just easier to buy them   and re spool when durability is lower than approx half   Also  fishing in the sea seems more difficult than in the lake  
On Silvermoon  EU  it costs around 110k  You can make that in about 8 10 hours of farming herbs  I just farm for about 1 hour every day and can buy it easily every month   Of course that may not be the case in a few months since herb prices have been going down steadily 
No you mis read what I meant  I understand the difference between player and team synergies but what I mean was that I noticed a change as soon as I equipped those synergies  What I was asking is if I would notice the RF on the players who have or is it not even a synergie that I should basically get guys for and waste my time

I think I can speak on this as a white nationalist   I find that the media tends to call us neo nazis or white supremacists to a greater degree than we self identify as those things   Most of us will call ourselves alt right or white nationalists   Also  white nationalism is typically something only found in former European colonies like the U S   Canada  or Australia   European  or South African  equivalents would be ethno nationalism   While there are some supremacist elements and beliefs within our groups  first and foremost we are nationalists   None of us mind other groups having nationalistic movements themselves   In fact I'd wager most of us would be fine working with Black nationalists or Hispanic nationalists to achieve our common goals    This isn't without precedent either  https   4 bp blogspot com  CbcE6rSSouc WAL8t2PEfHI AAAAAAAALfQ Ss8iDFtDQYQDYTxngXc3uLVd4cz rKBowCLcB s1600 George Lincoln Rockwell nation of islam jpg    We don't want to reinstitute slavery or commit genocide or anything like that   Our mainly  and in some cases only  goal is to have an ethno state where we are the super majority   This would be achieved by carving up existing nations along ethnic lines   If you ever hear someone mention the Amerikaner state  this is what they're talking about   We also don't reject identity politics like Libertarians  but instead embrace them    Here's  http   www npr org 2016 11 17 502476139 were not going away alt right leader on voice in trump administration  an article where Richard Spencer mentions this   Generally  I think the collapse of traditional social structures is helping the rise of the far right and far left   People are feeling lost and hopeless  and are searching for answers   In many ways this is similar to the early mid 20th century when people last sought out the far left and far right   Personally speaking  identitarian arguments from SJWs and feminists have helped convinced me of the benefits of group identity   Racially they focus on groups that have traditionally lost in cultural conflict with whites  such as Native Americans and Black Americans   These groups could be considered "identity deficient" due to losing much of their original culture  and cultural self expression being limited due to their status of minorities in a white majority nation   However  I think that whites could also be said to be "identity deficient" as a consequence of our victory in the global cultural conflict   We've entered into a sort of post identity era   In order for identity to exist there has to be something that sets you apart from the rest of humanity  but with the global domination of European  and especially Anglo American  culture there isn't anything unique to whites anymore   At this point many aspects of white culture can be thought of as the global human culture  with non whites having their local cultures to foil against ours   Liberal academia conceptualizes this phenomena as post colonialism  but I would consider it part of the structural collapse mentioned above   Initially I was an individualist  as I suspect many of you are  but I was pushed away from that mindset once I began to realize that individual actions are merely the result of genetics  biological environment  and social environment   This is another area where I was influenced by feminist thought  specifically intersectional feminism   An intersectional feminist views a person as solely the product of their intersecting social identities   In many ways this perspective is correct  the non biological components of our selves are inextricably linked to our social identities   Everything about us  from our purpose in life to our sexualities to our personalities  is partially determined by these identities  which are in turn inseparably tied into our social groupings   Thus  a society with strict social norms  if those norms incentivize people to reach the behavioral limits of their biology  is the structure under which humanity could achieve its greatest potential   Ultimately  when Melony looks at Serena and Alexis she sees her culture and identity lose just a little bit more of its uniqueness and distinctiveness  just as I do   From her perspective a culture that has fought so hard for recognition and self hood is absorbed into whiteness  and from my perspective a little bit more of the culture I feel like I barely knew is dissolved into our global society   All either of us want is the survival of our societies and cultures

Unfortunately it wasn't the case  I was given the ultimatum and I was forced to choose  See my daughter or Play a game I was so addicted to  If my wife had left me I'd been OK hadn't my daughter been in the picture  I know that sounds selfish of me but it's the way I've always been and I can't seem to change even if I wanted to  When I'm off work for a day I don't want to go shopping and walk around the mall  I want to drink a damn beer and shoot some dreg heads  Luckily for me I've been permitted to play once more under the premise I don't play but 12 hours a week which I can use however I choose  It's a sad story but it's very true and I can't change a single aspect of it without negatively affecting someone

You don't own a game when you purchase it  You purchase the license to play the game and by doing do  you must agree to adhere to the applicable licensing conditions    I totally get what you're saying and I don't disagree   I often used no CD cracks for games I own on my PC as I couldn't be bothered to swap discs all the time    But strictly speaking that could be seen as a license violation  It's simply the world we live in these days  
It's all meaningless  Anti natalism is the answer   s
It's cool he's been doing this every new years  but hisec caps are getting more rare  
Was a member for 59 years when I resigned last Feb   I truly had never heard of this  but it would have been a huge shelf item   I never looked at anti anything  so I would not have seen this   Nor was it ever in any lesson or discussion I ever attended  I was fully active in that church  but this never was presented   Thanks again 
What do you mean   She ran away from her parents to stay with the white fang because she wasn't afraid to fight  and thought that her parents refusing to take a more confrontational role meant they were cowards   She ran away from Adam because he will kill humans willy nilly and she realized "Oh wait  we're terrorists  This transformed from equality to revenge  I should not be a part of this anymore "

I'm a level 11 because of donations  I donate the max amount every season  but I only have level 9 10 commons  level 7 rare  and level 3 4 epic sitting around 3600 trophies  I would say I'm an average skill player  There are so many things to consider when trying to decide how good someone is  If you're at 4600 trophies as a level 10 I would say you're way above average 
And if for some reason you don't have enough  a trip to the dollar store should set you for life  A few of the ones in my area used to sell  12 packs of d6's for a dollar  6 white ones  6 of a variety of colors  
You lost in life  you lost in fantasy  dressed like a douche bag  no doubt you don't have a d  Open the drawer  pull out your 9 and squeeeeeze     You're just a loser  you dont need to breathe
Same problem I was having all day for my second profile  Spent 2 hours talking to support  Issue is with their servers   I can't even buy the free GWG 360 game  and it will probably be too late by the time they fix things  I specifically bought a month of Gold to see if payment works  but it's only showing up for One titles  and not the 360 games 
I don't think he was calling them out for paid sponsorship deals  he was calling them out for paid positive promotion   Look at Conan's segments on upcoming or newly released games which are paid advertisement sections of his show  Quite frequently he completely rips those games apart if he doesn't enjoy them    Even for entertainers I think it's unethical to portray the game in a positive light if they personally didn't enjoy it  That just makes you an extension of the publisher's marketing team 
I wish he would  But unless his game sells much more than 50 thousand  vive won't offer that kind of money  I doubt they even overed money  I think they over a Desk and manpower     but that said     onward could become that  what counter strike was in early standart shooters days 
Happy new year guys and girls     
I have goals  not resolutions 
I finished the dungeon this morning and I have to say its god damn awful  Aside from having to face my fear of falling into pure nothingness pure darkness  it was quite frustrating to get through  Nonetheless I got that damn hood and I wish there was a trophy to show off my accomplishement    
Are you sure Skyrim is too new  How old does it have to be  I mean  it's already 5 years old 
I rent all of mine so it does help a lot  I've never pay that much  Only one semester has cost me a lot and it was around  650 
Only one of those games got the remake recently  If the remake was like 8 years old and was still played then sure 
You saying "not a contradiction" over and over doesn't magically make all the contradictions disappear    You're desperately trying to connect the dots to make Blake's actions make sense even though everything she's done has flown in the face of what she's said she's trying to do   She says she's trying to avoid the WF yet goes out of her way to confront them every time she gets the chance even when doing so is directly at odds with her "rest and see my family" mission    You can't argue your way out of that  You fucking can't  
I get this on a daily basis with every mission  I just queue up after  click wait for players  the play anyway  and people join on me
Not me  way too many spoilers  unless I don't intend to see the movie then fine I get the Cole's notes version in 60 seconds  The rare exception are carefully crafted trailers that don't spoil anything

I could spend a month or two with just the current content if they updated Star Network to allow for more than 13 20fps     I'm definitely pumped for more locations and things to do in such a grand open space  but most of all I really hope that aspect of 3 0 delivers 
Wow so humourous  deserves an upvote  s
Those aren't even close to the same  Playing a game means constantly holding certain keys for periods of time and quickly switching to others and even holding multiple at a time  and it requires a very different resting position for your hand  And the mouse is even more difficult to get used to  Go ahead and try using a controller and tell me how that goes

To preface this answer  I need to give some context  Hawking  Dawkins  and Krauss all promote this idea  It stems from science which supports that the universe must be flat and have a total energy of zero  By that they mean the combination of negative energy from gravity and the positive energy of other forces  create a totally self contained system that does not violate the laws of physics   This means in an empty universe  the vast infinite ocean of nothing  now known as a quantum field   is the source of all particles and anti particles  The big reveal is that this quantum field can coalesce to a point  where it can fluctuate over an infinite amount of time  In this universe time is irrelevant  It will eventually fluctuate enough to cause a new universe  set off by a runaway chain reaction where particles and anti particles don't interact enough to settle down back into the quantum field  This is where you get stuff  basically everything we can see in the universe  This doesn't violate the laws of physics because nothing is being created or destroyed here  the quantum field is the same as before  just in a different state  Similar to a cup of water being boiled into vapor  the water is the same it's just in a different state of matter   While that sounds great and all  there are still issues with this "great answer to everything " Hawking  Dawkins  and Krauss all really get in your face about it and love to flash it around like it disproves God and other ridiculous things scientists should not do  but it has a huge problem  The problem with this answer is that you get a "turtles all the way down" problem  Where did the quantum field come from  In other words  if that is the universe and how it originates  where did the originator mechanic  the quantum field  originate from  Why is it there  It's not a nothing  it's a something  It exists  What brought it into existence  The mystery has not been solved  Hawking  and other physicists  just moved the goalpost   The universe is not only infinite and incomprehensible  but also has infinite and incomprehensible answers to its infinite and incomprehensible mysteries

Well one adds infinite possibilities and additions to one of the greatest games ever   the other is  effectively useless  Go for the fun option  Mods make Skyrim even better 
no  it should say download not purchase  Hmm  pretty weird well not sure what else it could be unless you friend made his account on his xbox home again or something  I would double check his account is home on your xbox again  
I don't know about a crimson days  maybe the same thing as last year  no additional items  But I see a spring update with old raid to end the year  after that content start to get dry we will probably be going into destiny 2 alpha beta and to end year 3 destiny 1 we will have a moments or Triumph

Generation the best movies  
There are also heroes filling two roles  just to add on the point you're making and what the video was about  An example is if you go 2 bruisers  they make up for a tank and a DPS together  Tyrande and Tassadar lacks proper healing alone  but they both fill a void in the DPS department    I feel the problem is that the role system is too simplified  when certain heroes fills more than one role at once  You need to learn this by either playing those heroes or learning it outside of it  which not all players seem to do and the game doesn't really help you with these simplified roles 
I'm not defending them  but I do find it annoying when white women shame white males for their skin color 
You could always just take the Feat Magic Initiate  That will give you some magic without losing any levels in Rogue  You can say you found a wizard spellbook and have been studying it  The Warlock spells of Booming Blade Cantrip  True Strike Cantrip and Hex Lv1 spell can do A LOT for a rogue   Booming blade ups the damage you can do each turn and you can Cunning Action disengage and move away forcing them to move and take more damage from the cantrip   True Strike gives you advantage to hit  that means Sneak Attack   Hex gives you and extra 1d6 damage on each hit    OR  you can multiclass Monk and go Way of the Shadow for an amazing combination with Assassin Rogue  This will get you some casting  can up the damage of your daggers to d6s  you can get Flurry of Blows AND can teleport when inside shadows

It varies a lot but  well  your food and rent costs can only go so low  even if you live in a low cost town city  That's why taxes are not just percentage based  but the percentage rises as you make more money  Regardless  I would pay my rent twice if I could make 20 hour  I'd still come out ahead

I think the issue is people look at it and think  "I can't stun a raid boss this is useless "  But they forget that a lot of raid bosses have adds that can be stunned     And then they say  "well haste isn't a good stat for me and I don't need to move "  Well fuck haste is one of my worst stats but an extra 15  for ten seconds is a lot of haste which means my energy regen is a lot higher and my attacks happen faster     As far as not needing to move that may be true  but it never hurts to move a little faster   And honestly for most classes right now it takes 1 gcd to proc it   Which is minimal for the return    And once it can proc on interrupts    well there are lots of bosses that can be interrupted in and out of raids  It's a good ring  people are just bitches

I used to think like that too  It took  ages  for guildies to convince me to use steam  but when I finally did I thought it was okay  Same for origin   Then I saw problems  Take DarkSpore  A game that I had to use a client before I could even load the game  a game I played in beta   liked so much  I even went out   bought a new gfx card just to play it better  Used to play single player   occasionally co op   Then after a while of playing other games  I returned to DarkSpore to play single player  only for the icon on origin being unclickable  It wasn't until I searched online if others had same problem   how they fixed it  that I found out the  games servers had been murdered  it would  never  be playable again  including the single player   https   www youtube com watch v T2pdvh4uiaM   Similar happened when Gamespy died  ARMA series wasn't able to be used until much later when it was attached to steam servers  But  I had three copies of ARMA2 series  all were forced onto steam   because steam is steam  I now only have one copy of ARMA2     Look at it another way  steam had that mass outage other night  They never said sod all  nothing new there   In the mean time  anyone wanting to play games had to play offline  which is of fuck all use for those of us that wanted to play online pvp games  Same as in past when servers went down  Wizard Wars wouldn't work  despite the game being on paradix's own servers   so on

more detailed biology behind it  men's orgasms are a complete firing of all the orgasm related neurons  The whole system has to be going for proper ejaculation and sperm delivery    Women's orgasms dont need all their neurons in the region firing in order to orgasm  They can have clitoral orgams  Vaginal  etc     To reset the neurons so that they can fire an oragsmic response again takes time  Chemicals have to be reabsorbed and replenished  Women don't have to rest the whole system like men do after orgasm

  the smaller tv producers and staff lose jobs  Only if they are trying to compete with big players head on  If they start creating good quality niche content  then people who want that content will happily pay  Like they could be the 90s sitcom rerun channel with no commercials that plays the shows in order of broadcast  I'd sign up for that  as they should be cheaper to run and operate because they're not making their own content

Oh  then I totally agree with you  to a slightly lesser extent   Mature  unbiased discussion about being LGBT  or biased discussion  as long as it's a discussion and not an argument  is perfectly fine  IMO   Full on parades about being LGBT   Eh  that's stretching boundaries   Ah  the Harlem Shake   Irrelevant comment  most of my class stopped loving the Harlem Shake once I told them that the dance move wasn't original   I said it was called "The Weekender"   Don't know if that's true  but hey  they stopped    But now they think they're  1  so that's a thing    I know the best places to go to implant that thought   Health classes   That's why I'm so open to LGBT people  my teacher  a hardcore liberal  was not only one of the most  pardon my Paris  fucking badass people in my school  but he also supported people expressing individuality   Hell  he even went so far as to stop a homophobic janitor from cleaning his classroom for a few weeks because he said that the staff member was "just as dirty as the trash he wants to pick up"   Ah  the memories   Anyways  just add that little number into health class  and maybe people will accept the fact   In theory   Also slightly irrelevant   There is a fine line between criticizing LGBT and insulting LGBT   There's always gonna be that one misanthrope who thinks the world can shove it   Other than that  yeah  it's a vicious cycle   IMO  it has been getting boring to talk about LGBT   I just hope Trump doesn't do anything to reduce voter turnout  or something stupid like that

Unless you have consistently high damage elsewhere in your team  you're doing yourself a disservice by attempting to do what an assassin mage is supposed to do in my opinion  A combo will deal heavy damage  that's true but as will a few basic attacks from a basic attack oriented build     Edit  I don't mean building Transcendence as being completely ability based but literally building him similar to other ability based gods is when I do consider him ability based  similar to Loki's build

I never have all golds just because I haven't really seen the need for it  long as my toughness is above 100k and I have at least a blue M44  I'm good  Generally extract with blue and a couple purple pieces  though I've done it with much less  Greens  a blue holster and vest  blue M44 and my trusty M9    But there is tons of loot solo  it's fun either way  I've probably successfully extracted about 90  of the time    I did extract once with just a blue vest  for the hell of it  killed my hunter with a gas grenade and pistol headshots

We had a Tachanka yesterday who took eight seconds to line up the shot with the hostage and shoot him in the back of the head  he was the last one  What got me pissed was the fact that we lost after I got an ace  and he just had to shoot the hostage for a laugh

Conversely I think Revelations was the worst by far  That story was just terrible  the way they throw characters at you from both games with no development or anything at all    this was not a good title  I seriously disagree with anyone who thinks this is better than Awakening  At least that story was dumb fun and it was really awesome  This was just a chore  I disliked my character Corrin the more I played  "They mught betray us " Corrin  "that's fine  I trust them"  BETRAYED  not even two stages later  like cmon now

I think it depends partially on how city limits are drawn  if the city limits include more impoverished neighbourhoods and exclude the richer ones then the homicide rates appear higher for that city  I'm assuming higher poverty   higher homicide   It might be interesting to see how this data looks if you compare Metropolitan areas vs City limits  that would get rid of the way the limits are drawn skewing the figures 
Author also doesn't mention the article by Cruchyroll was only talking about debuting series and ranking them and doesn't count pre existing series like One Piece  Naruto  Gintama who are way more popular and viewed then both Re Zero and Yuri

It WAS NOT always this bad   Movies used to be only previews then the show  No bullshit ahead of time  lights dimmed  you get the previews then the shows  They're fucking us  Hard    Somewhat related  I got a fucking pop up ad yesterday on PAID CABLE TV in the middle of a goddamned show  Cable company might be getting fired  Fuck  
I thought so    
Hope springs eternal    I guess that's a happy reason 
Then theaters and Hollywood go around complaining about people not going to the movies as much as they'd want us to   Figures     I used to go once every week or two  for many years  Not so much anymore  I go a handful of times a year now  for some of the big movies I really want to see on the big screen   Make the movie going experience enjoyable and I'll go more   Keep pushing more and more commercials before show and making me pay for fucking  no good 3D by not offering the movie any other way in the nearest theaters and I'll continue on the trend of seeing movies at Home  on the big screen TV either through download  hard copy  DVD  Blu Ray  or direct streaming service  cable provider  Netflix  
Metal Gear Solid is a love it or hate it series  Has always been that way   It am one of those that hate it  but several people I know  love  that game   For me the game is just    dumb  Dumb jokes  mediocre gameplay  action scenes that don't make much sense  story that doesn't make any sense at all  Just    dumb        I guess it is kind of like the Space Balls of the gaming world  it is actually nothing like Space Balls  but work with me      Some people really enjoy Space Balls and think it is hilarious  others hate the movie because it is just so dumb

Not much difference tbh  They were in the same alliance  have similar playstyles and are friendly to each other  By that i mean they shoot each other when they meet but don't go after assets  I think HK is a bit better in wh combat and lzhx better in k space but that might be subjective  HK has a lot of PL dudes in it though    HK also likes to evict wh krabs  which is a community service as far as I'm concerned    
I think that's only because of the lack of competition  Without knowing a whole lot  feel free to educate me  It seems like she was just the first good women UFC fighter  Then she started this wave of others joining and got outclassed pretty quick  She was comparatively good to the competition  Then the competition stepped up and she's not really anything special anymore    I mean  she got downright embarrassed in those two fights  She was literally a punching bag this fight  
There are so many more aspects to Skyrim than stupid old Draugr 
Haven't actually played that game yet because I still don't have a PS4  gonna get one in the next current year   but I have been able to listen to the soundtrack since I got the special edition  and it is amazing   Before Dawn Breaks and Floral Rainfall are the two standouts for me 
It doesn't matter  what  day it is  The thing of value is that there is a particular time we dedicate to thinking about how to better ourselves  It's like Yom Kippur in Judaism   you can apologise for your sins and seek forgiveness any old time  but a day dedicated to self reflection can really make a difference

Not that great of an idea for ladder  might be good for tournaments though 
You start with 0 operators  You buy the operators with in game currency you get from playing matches  watching tutorial vids  playing single player  etc  In your first hour or so of playing  you can watch 3 tutorial vids and play one single player mission and easily amass 1000 credits  That is enough for 2 ops  If you play a decent number of hours you will quickly get all of the original operators that come with the game  which is a lot most of them

I'm trying to keep this about ideas and you are making it about my imputed wilful ignorance  And yet you still don't want to say one word about what it is that I'm wilfully ignoring   Ignorance is about facts  Disagreement about values is not ignorance  You seem to take it as a given that socialism is good  and that I'm wilfully ignorant because I do not agree  If that is indeed the case  then we disagree not about socialism but about the meaning of knowledge and ignorance

First off  I actually said "ewwugh" when I opened the link  I almost feel bad because it's well executed for what it is  Paint and build look great  but outside of a very small niche  it's useless    It's like watching Anthony Bourdain and his friends spend hours cooking a lamb's head  Apparently it's a delicacy to people in the know   It's fine if you and your friends want to grill a lamb's head and talk about how amazing it is  But don't think just because five people really like it that you can open up a food truck and sell your wares for top dollar to the masses

But he   like me   DOES PVP   but has stopped playing PVP in the The Division a long long time ago  as the mechanics are so broken and haven't changed in nine months    I have not bothered with it since 1 1  but have over 150 hours of pure PVP with BF1 since mid November   I will happily give it another try if Massive completely revamp it  but simply do not see it happening

The biggest problem with it is the story  It's just not finished  You can tell they thought they were starting a franchise  and the story just sort of meanders at first  then finally actually starts to get interesting  but then it just finishes  There's no conclusion for any of the character arcs  you just go to Tesla  which feels like some sort of side rescue mission  and the game just ends   Then we get a sort of Batman style foreshadowing for a sequel  Fuck that  you dont get to set up a sequel in the first game of a series when you really didn't deliver a complete game to begin with  It's so arrogant  What there is there is fine  although I hate e black bars on the screen and would rather lower resolution than that  but the abrupt sequel baiting ending just pissed me off  I won't touch their games again

I said this in my other posts  but STEM fields are saturated in some places too  you need to look into a degree and the job prospects before you start anything  STEM doesn't guarantee a job any more than arts degrees do  market saturation is important to know  For example  where I live  Electrical Engineers can't find jobs at all  but where my brother in law works  they can't find any and really need some    Often times trades jobs are in hot demand  but it's frowned on by society for some reason

What is this thing called "socializing" that you speak of 
Downvoted  not sorry  
   if they've not abandoned the iPod all together yet  The last update to the iPod line was July 2015  and most of that was just colors   They discontinued the iPod Classic at some point within the last few years  abandoning the original form factor and design concept   They don't aggressively market the iPod anymore  and if they do anything to market it  they aren't doing it anywhere I can see it   You call that not abandoning   It's a sign of things to come   The Mac Pro similarly hasn't been updated since 2013   even longer   and that used to be the flagship Mac product   So again  how does that not look like abandonment   Macbook Air  last updated March 2015   iMac  last updated October 2015   A full calendar year went by without updates to most of the product lines  and when the Macbook Pro update did come out  it had been over a year since the last minor update  four years since the last major update     I'm curious how much further they have to go before you see signs of abandonment 
  If X takes 8 hours to complete something and Y takes 12  why do bosses typically think "Y is dedicated" and not "Y is inefficient"   It's hard to compare the two   If your boss gives you something and it only takes you 8 hours  many will think "well i didn't give him enough work  here's 4 more hours of shit to do"

Honestly this was an issue for a whole bunch of laptops from that period and it is somewhere between 3 parties  Microsoft changing default behaviours when providing GPU context  the motherboard  in this case laptop  designers base drivers and AMD with their own GPU drivers   I even had to deal with a fairly recent 2015 Dell Alienware laptop running Windows 7 that completely broke the iGPU GPU handover after a random Windows Update  And this is with nVidia  To this day there are no Dell drivers that fix this  And just installing nVidia's separate drivers was a recipy for disaster if you hand any mobile chipsets as each OEM had a slightly altered design or deviated from default power thermal limits

Because despite the best intentions of its employees   CCP is one of most inconsiderate companies in regards to its customers    They literally do not consider the players when making game decisions  instead they build the game they want to play or think is cool    Because they are building for themselves   they routinely fail to consider that the average person only has a limited amount of time and energy  Instead they make design choices based on their current interpretation of the game  which may make the game incrementally better for the existing player base than the last iteration  but really only adds complexity and pain   especially for new users or current users with more demanding schedules    So your interpretation is accurate    Eve is hard and most times it is not fun  Hell   most of the time it's not even relaxing    The suggestion to join a group is a great suggestion   Its the single most enjoyable part of the game   But you have to work for it still    Everyone is putting time in on a consistent schedule and the expectation is that you will do the same   A lot of your time will be spent learning   theory crafting   traveling   scouting  scanning and not really playing a game    All of this isn't to scare you away   I am just trying to set your expectations  Rarely   something epic will happen   And even more rarely   you will get to participate in those events    But when you do      It will be worth everything  You'll have been part of a global event that main stream media covers for a few days and the world will talk about for months if not years to come    So if you have the time and the energy to dedicate a part of your life to EvE   you will never find another game like it    But short of that   look else where     Typos  sorry   first time using swiftkeyboard   it's s a clusterfuck

I've been working my way through movies on Itunes like an upstanding adult   It's weird to pay for movies and stuff  In reverse order   The Magnificent 7 redo was ok   Fuqua is solid at action but I don't think westerns work any more unless you can pull a Costener and believably embrace the genre as it used to be   Trying to go halfway feels clunky   Sully was solid   Tom Hanks is always great   The best part of the movie was easily the recreation of the crash  which was in there twice      The Shallows was fun   It's weird seeing what's essentially a low budget survival movie with pretty cinematography  lots of drone shots  and a heaping spoon of CG  but Blake Lively sold it   I hated the CG dolphins but didn't mind the CG shark   The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford  I know this one is an old one  was really fascinating too  Long shots with very little dialogue between Casey Affleck and Brad Pitt   Sorta homoerotic really   Can't recommend highly enough   Great but boring   As for shows  same shit everybody else watches  Westworld and Stranger things were by far my favorite shows of the year

Whilst having Destiny 2 on PC at higher framerates would be awesome  consider that there may well be good technical reasons for capping it  particularly if they're building a game for three platforms simultaneously  The closer they behave to each other the easier they are to keep balanced  Still at this point before the PC release is even confirmed it's hard to know what to expect

I agree with you  I actually think people that bitch about the game not being long enough or whatever are    well    assholes  It's one thing to flat out not like the game but another to lambast it because its length  The cost of having the order double the length while looking as good as it does was just not possible    The biggest mistake was it not being a launch title

As much as I agree with most everything you said  I think taking the view of cities like Grand Theft Auto does would be the way to go    The roads are populated more or less with cars and people  The volume of traffic differs depending on the time of day and location  And considering how few buildings you can actually enter  the city still feels "alive"   I personally don't expect a bustling cityscape with so much detail that you can roleplay without ever going into space  but I do hope for some quality detail  I do also recall devs in an ATV  maybe  don't remember exactly  mention that they would rather have a smaller  handbuilt  and detailed city that is entirely explorable rather than a huge cityscape that has a lot of repeated building designs and not much to actually explore

This is why you should not be suspended for TK  Trolls will be trolls  The very thing we try to stop them with they use to hurt the ones who the devs tried to protect with it 
 But when it comes to shooting situations  there are a lot of things that might make an officer not want to expose their body  In this case  a second camera on the weapon would probably be the only useful footage captured   So the reason it took you so long to reply was you needed to go watch a few action movies or something   Shooting without looking is not a real thing that cops do  and if they did theyd be charged  the body camera would already show that  Your fantasy is so removed from reality that its somewhat entertaining    isn't this where you'd want a camera to actually work  and show that the officer didn't fire that shot   balistic evidence proves that  not  an absence of  video footage   Try again    Further  officer safety is the higher priority than superfluous camera mounted to a firearm just because  A unnescessary and wholy useless camera that occupies the spot of a flashlight is less safe for all     If officer worn cameras are about accounting for both situation and shots fired   False  That is the situation  moreso a  gun mounted camera that cant possibly work the way you dream it doesn't add any more info  To tell whether the aim was intentional itd need to record forward and back  meaning youd need to replace every gun  Good luck with that

I do as well   to an extent His Raid is arguable the toughest in the entire game and the method that we do use to beat him is indirect rather than straightforward  In fact  we can't really hurt him directly until the very end of the Raid and even then you have to lay some considerable force into him before his heart gives out   However  in trying to get to the root of why Oryx in game seems weaker  there's a few plausible reasons that have been given   Though there's also a behind the scenes reason as to why I think there is a disconnect  This is a guess based off some employee testimony     I'd hazard that BUNGIE's dev team builds the game mechanics and assets  Characters  environment  etc   first and then has the writing team come after and then try to write an in game explanation and give vital and supplementary details of the game who  what  where  when  why  and how  So it's possible the narrative and lore world building comes after everything else rather than during or before the asset world building   Now  this method of development is not wrong and more than likely has worked for other games   but it may not be working for Destiny   Of course  this is still a guess on my end    There's also the fact that well   If Oryx could just one shot us at the beginning of the Raid and was purely invincible then   you'd have considerably more complaints  So at times you just have to put the narrative to side and let the game be a game  If that makes any sense    As for us being the most powerful beings in the universe  I largely concur  We have become Legend  but that doesn't mean there still isn't still anything that could challenge us 
Palpatine wasn't actually racist  the human supremacy thing was just a political tool for him  and later in Darth Kryat's Empire there were even Stormtroopers of races who needed special built armor

Well his sister in law  sister to Benoit's wife victim  appeared on the Talk is Jericho podcast during the summer and firmly stated that there was premeditation involved in the murders  including deep research into how to snap one's neck effectively  his method of suicide   and that the manner of which his wife was found was "brutalized "

She drove herself to insomnia trying to fight White Fang in Volume 2  because she's trying to force herself to overcome her cowardice  She also stayed with her friends vs Torchwick in the Paladin  stayed with her friends vs the Grimm on Mountain Glenn  stayed with her friends vs White Fang on the train  stayed with her friends vs everyone on the tournament  etcetera    That's kinda been the whole point of her character development  Learning to trust the people who care about her and learning to forgive herself  and allowing people to help her drive her away from her deep seated psychological issues  Even now  she may have run away from her friends  but she went back to her family because she realized she was wrong to leave them  She has yet to realize she was wrong to leave her friends  because Sun obnoxiously interrupted her before she could even say why she left   Her dialogue does not indicate that she has no problem that the White Fang knows her location  No  her dialogue indicates that she really fucking hates Sun because he's annoying her and refusing to respect her privacy while lying about it   This is not breaking character under any circumstances  She's only breaking the character that you think she is  Again  her character is incredibly hamfisted  in your face  and lacking in any real subtlety or nuance  so I'm rather surprised you have an inability to understand who she even is given how obviously they're telegraphing it   I mean  yeah  she runs  That's the point  She thinks running to her problems is better than running away from them now  And she only thinks running away is a problem once she realizes she hurt the people she was trying to protect  This is who she is 
Which is weird because she posted this photo montage of famous black women in interracial relationships and didn't seem to be as triggered then by it as she is now   http   web archive org web 20161224212317 http   theurbantwist com 2016 12 22 shes swirl 10 black female celebs dated white men   "I like mine straight chocolate but I can appreciate the swirl  Without it we wouldnt have had the last 8 years  under President Obama  whose mama also was down with the swirl "  vs  "Last week I published an article titled Shes Down With the Swirl  pointing out high profile Black women who dated and married outside of their race  On the list was Venus Williams  her sister  Serena recently announced that she is engaged to Reddit co founder  Alexis Ohanian   I think Im as liberal as the next  and while I recognize that we would not have had our first Biracial president if there werent people who dated outside of the Black race  I dont like it  Yea I said it  in just 2 days it will be 2017 and even though I know Im not supposed to say it in this day and age  its true  Why lie  Im one who believes desegregation and legalizing interracial marriage destroyed the Black community  YES  I said it   The more I watch Black men and women date and marry any race other than Black  the more I want to cry  We now live in a society where it is commonplace to see mixed families  where history books are being rewritten to erase the brutality that was enacted upon Africans brought to America  We live in a society where little Black babies are continuously being adopted by non Black parents who neglect their real history and heritage "  So brave  She said what she thought so many other people were thinking  but she had the courage to print it   s The thing is  if a white person said the equivalent of this  it would be tantamount to white supremacy KKK beliefs   Apparently  desegregation and interracial marriage is what pushed black fathers out of the family unit  "As a Black person  you should not be able to turn a blind eye to these things  You can and should not ignore that in 2017 we are seeing too much of the same behavior  rhetoric and malice that has plagued Black people in America for centuries  Nothing has changed  Before we progressed with desegregation  the Black community was a strong community  Black people had generational wealth and or businesses to pass down through the family  Black people owned property  the Black family was close and the father was in the home "  In her opinion  black people and the community for them has weakened and not "progressed"

No problem man   As you know the only issue is that with the PS4 you have to actually replace the internal drive so the bigger capacity SSD the better   But with Xbox you just add it as an external drive  So in my case I just got the 256gb Samsung and I only run problematic games from it  bf4 with all bf4 dlc   bf1  with 49  space still left   while at the same time still running all my other games from the Xbox's standard internal drive    So because it's not possible to add drives as external drives on PS4  and the internal drive has to be replaced  it would be advisable to go with a SSD that's got a capacity that's not too small  which can be very pricey when getting into terabyte sizes 
No  In fact because of the connection in our brains between colors and emotions  colorblind people cannot feel these emotions at all  at least not like most of us  This is why colorblind people  especially red green  often have failed marriages and high rates of suicide

I think you're right that it's already gone too far to actually change  But it's still frustrating  There's actually no point in having the term bricked at this point  If it's used to represent such a widely defined set of conditions  it loses its purpose as a useful descriptive term    But that's just me complaining

Thank you   I don't have a mandolin so I had to slice it all by hand  I would definitely not make it again unless I get one of those  
i can handle carrying around a heavy gun  it may not be for everyone  but for how large of a caliber it is  the weight helps reduce recoil  If the gun was lighter  then the  308 round that it shoots would be very uncontrollable  not that you would shoot it rapid fire  but if you had to then the weight would help  I am personally not a fan of polymer guns  of the 6 guns i own  all of them are oak  and I have never one had a problem with the stocks or forearms  I have a mossberg model 870  it was about the 18000th produced and it is a 1950 model  The gun is in very good condition and it is shot almost every 2 months  I personally prefer wooden stocks over polymer  Im not saying that anything is wrong with polymer at all  i just dont like them  back to the  308 caliber  I personally want a large caliber that is very versatile and powerful  I know that some people swear by  223  but I think it is too small for me  I want a lot of firepower but not a really really heavy gun like a 50 cal  the m14 is just my preferance because it fits all of the requirements of what i want it to have  It also has a magazine and not a clip or single shot or magazineless  where you load the ammo individually into the gun  i dont know the name of it  it all just comes down to personal preferance and the m14 is my choice

Yeah but in that sense a collectathon is really inappropriate since you're not being tasked with collecting 100 of the same item  but rather special and hard to come by items  
Some guy tried to fuck me over by getting me to send him the money through PayPal  I agreed to buy a pair of Jordan 6 black infrareds from him through a PayPal invoice for a cheaper price  so he messages me and says he sent the invoice  I check my inbox   nothing  I message him and he says he'll send it again   nothing  I message him back and says something must be wrong with my PayPal and that he'll resend the invoice in the morning  Next morning he says he sent me it again   nothing  He tells me to just gift him the money and he'll ship the shoes because it wasn't working  Meanwhile  PayPal support told me there was 100  nothing wrong with my account and that the seller never sent me the invoice  I messaged him back and told him "I don't want your shoes anymore" and he responded "I'm confused  Why don't you want them" and I replied "I don't want your shit I'll go buy them from someone else "  I won a bid for the black infrared 6s later that day and had no problems whatsoever

Unfortunately when you cancel your insurance you are now with out coverage  No big deal until    you decide to get insurance again  Then you are classified as high risk again because you have "no prior insurance "   What you can do is get insurance as a storage vehicle  Some companies will give you a "comprehensive only" plan  Meaning if a tornado or a tree or something happens out of your control to your vehicle it will be covered  Let them know you plan on parking it and not driving   Be sure to let them know it will be in a covered locked aera  You will still be covered for some random shit happening you will still maintain insurance and the payment will be a whole lot less per year  Hope this helps

It's been awhile  but I believe just putting the disc in will start a download to play 360 games  If you're internet is slow  like mine  it's takes awhile since it's essentially downloading a new copy of the game from Xbox Live and just using the disc as confirmation that you own the game 
Yet Supercell has a report button for global and clan chat in Clash of Clans  Obviously it gets abused over there  but they have had it for as long as I can remember  They even introduced the report button into the clan chat with the most recent update  where it hadn't been until now   So what's the difference

As many on this thread have pointed out  this doesn't make him smart because many others had also predicted Bitcoin technology and more accurately than this  I shared it because I'm a fan of Milton Friedman and his economic brilliance gives credit to the potential of Bitcoin technology  If he saw something like this being so fundamental  then I can have more confidence in this project as an investor  Honestly  if Milton Friedman thought this could change the world of transactions when the internet was only just blossoming  he was on to something  I'm tempted to buy some more btc after just seeing Milton Friedman endorse it

A lot of allure  at least for me  is that you can get punished in a build for making mistakes along the way when leveling up  Getting to 65 was just a random number I threw out there  It could be lower  or higher   This would still be the case  Even with this system  There still won't be a complete passive reset  and GGG could just as easily lower the drop rate of Orb of Regrets to balance the for the fact it takes less time to get to end game   This would allow for people to be more willing to think outside of the box and to potentially just throw away characters  GGG could also use this as a system to get more revenue from people needing to buy character slots   I don't want leveling to go completely to the wayside like it is on D3  I'm mimicking the system like Marvel Heroes 2016  It still takes about 6 to 10 heroes depending on the hero to get all of the way to 60  max level  and to finish the story and to start end game content  I think that would be a good timeframe for PoE   But with GGG dropping to two difficulties when Act 5 is released  I believe it will be just right  Still have to do the leveling process  but it won't take as long as it does now

Cause it's not that easy  lol   There are only so many quality players at any given time   As the population increases  so does that number of quality players  but as it stands  we can't add 6 more teams right now   2 is feasible  but not 6   And even then  expansion requires a lot of work   Finding owners  building stadiums  setting up the mountain of logistics   We can't just "add more expansion teams " it takes time

I agree  I have spent a good amount of money in this game  and I am at a higher level gameplay than most  4500    But I was wondering  what stratagies do you think would make it the easiest for a level 11 to get higher  I currently use RG Elite Barbs since They are both common so I could max them in a few months

Three interpretations   1  You took 39 damage  you lose 39 maximum HP   2  You took 5 damage  you lose 5 maximum HP   3  The bear takes 34 damage  loses 34 maximum HP  is reduced to 0 maximum HP  and you die   I would say that you resolve the damage before the rider  which would rule out  3  fortunately  It isn't the damage which has the kill effect  it is the maximum HP reduction  which comes after   You are still the same creature though  you have just shifted form  As such  I am inclined towards  1    I might rule it as  2  though  When in doubt and it's probably going to kill the player  I tend to rule unclear rules in favour of the players  so long as it does not seem unfairly kind to do so

I take kratom everyday unfortunately  Have been for years  Phenibut removes the anxiety  I only take it twice a week and not even  forgot about it last week   I take it on the days I have meeting and I know that the pressure anxiety will be high  Sometime it will give euphoria and also makes me more sociable   Also phenibut potentiates kratom when you take them together  One thing though  phenibut takes a long time to take effect  For some people it takes 4 hours but for me it takes 2 3 hrs  They have a phenibut subreddit on here too  just search for it

  serious relatable subjects but in a way that I dont feel like Im talked down to   Your J Cole comparison is actually real keen  I haven't heard it before but I love it  J Cole feels like "one of us" rather than a rapper making it big  he does so either by rapping about loving rap or doing Wet Dreamz type stuff  Oddisee tho feels like one of us in that relatable  semi serious type of way just by being down to earth  I never feel like he's trying to reach into the big leagues the way J Cole does  and I'm never getting that heady  out there "conscious" rapper shit from him either  I feel like he's more that 4 year degree intelligent college rapper than J Cole is

There are different cutting agents you can use  Most common in my area is inositol powdered supplement  Drug stores have actually raised the cost of inositol over the years because of this  It's also kept behind the counters  You crush pure and mix 30 50  cut into it then add acetone to the mix till you can form the product and the cut into a ball  you then put it into a clean white cotton shirt or sheet them wring the rag out to remove as much acetone you can with the ball of product in the rag  then put it into your homemade press till as compact as you can get it  After remove from rag in its new brick form then microwave in 10 15 second intervals removing every time to air out the microwave  then do it over and over till it nice and hard  You can burn if not careful  Then put into freezer for a few minutes  then serve up  That's what I heard anyway

I was also considering limiting magic until they rediscovered it  but that seemed daunting  I could have magic start out as strictly something that's a gift from the gods  so warlocks  clerics  paladins  and grow it from there  to druids  wizards  etc     I had Volo's in mind  since there shouldn't be dungeons  at least at first   I was thinking of introducing civilizations  like the yuan ti  myconids  and others  that the god who brought them there either didn't know about or didn't consider "sentient " I haven't really decided if I'm going to do that yet  Alternatively I could bring those races over  and they for whatever reason don't heed the god's warning and continue opposing other races   As for the ruins of an extremely advanced civilization  I considered making the setting somewhere on a devastated Earth where no humans survived some worldwide catastrophe  The ruins they find are remnants of a futuristic society  Since the players are refugees from a similar extinction level event in their plane  I wanted to draw the parallel  as if this is a cyclic pattern  That pattern actually exists in Hindu mythology  so it would fit right in to the cosmology I'm creating

   the human supremacy thing was just a political tool for him  Was this even a thing  Definitely did not get a sense of this in the movies and the few Clone Wars episodes I've seen   read about    Outside of the Legends continuity  which I am not super familiar with beyond certain works     and later in Darth Kryat's Empire there were even Stormtroopers of races who needed special built armor   No longer cannon  but also would not really apply to the discussion at hand

This  Enjoying the early game is  a matter of perspective  will  and for some self deception  There are things you can do to make yourself enjoy it  For example  Plan and build your character around being speed clear meta the entire play through  not just end game  Or use poelfg  guilds  and friendships to start a leveling party  and have everyone allot a 10 hour period to questing together  not speed questing  but dicking around and bantering and enjoying the game  Or come up with silly stupid challenges to do  play through the entire story without using way points or portals or play through the story using no support gems and only one skill gem  or without flasks    Or try this for once  Actually read the story

It was the result of the player forgetting things OOC  but it was very fitting   Enter Smoganthador  a great and powerful half dragon who was very much the bombastic sort   He lives in the not X mansion with the rest of the PCs   And in this particular case we were doing some cross game adventures with other campaigns  so we were among strangers   Mostly   Everyone is introducing themselves to each other in game  and Smog's intro is something to the effect of "I am Smoganthador the great  lord of the seven fires  master of all scaled beings  baron of badass  etc   "  "I know   We live together "  I was playing the cohort of one of his allies   Who incidentally  also lives in the not X mansion   I know he forgot that OOC  but it was so very fitting in character as well

For D to D  switch to tight point  I start staggered by default then switch depending on how they play  Don't control the 2 wingers and let the CPU play them as tight point  they play it well    As for zone entry  they're slowing down then zig zagging in  if you're controlling your wingers coming back and staying in front of them  it usually means they'll have an open player trailing  Try switching to your D and using good gap control  when they cross your blue line and drop it  your forwards should be there to pressure them  makes it a lot harder for them

I think it would be cool to do a TTK test by taking all of the non shotgun weapons and shooting a 1  2  3  and 3 Rook armor operator at a typical engagement distance  maybe 10 or 15 meters  using the ping tool as a rangefinder  Using these you can calculate TTK based off of damage at 10m  or whatever distance is used  Unfortunately  this is extremely time consuming    The fastest way to do this would be to get 4 people including yourself in a custom game where attack defense rotation is disabled  Start with attackers  One person is on the attacking side  the one who will be shooting  The other 3 are defenders  One defender is 1 armor  another is 2 armor  and the last is Rook  Shoot each defender a single time and record damage  Then  have them pick up Rook armor and shoot them again  record the damage  It would be best to do this in a custom game where health is set to its maximum  200  for damage testing high damage rifles like Glaz's  even if it is semi auto we can calculate theoretical lowest non headshot TTK because we know its maximum fire rate  240 RPM   Once testing for one gun is completed  kill the hostage  Alternate between the defenders and attackers killing the hostage and set the game for infinite overtime  Repeat until all attacker's guns have been tested  Then start a new game where everyone is a defender  This time do the same thing except you can test more than one gun at a time  For example  you can shoot everyone once with the UMP and record damage  shoot everyone once with the MP7 and record damage  and then pick up Rook armor and repeat  I honestly don't expect anyone to do this because of how time consuming it is but I typed this far so I guess I'll post it  
I do this all the time  
well shit

It's very possible to get quite rich just spamming Red maps  If you didn't hit Guardians Shaper Uber Atziri in the first 1 2 weeks  it's probably one of the most reliable ways to get rich outside of flipping  After the initial rush  Red mapping is how I make a shitload of money every league   There are a few things you need to be aware of if you want to make money this way  and some setup you need to do  I play on HC leagues generally  but this advice should be mostly universal  From your post  you have a good Atlas setup  so we're going to skip that initial part    nbsp     Keep Clearspeed first and foremost in your mind     The first  and most important thing you need to be aware of is that clearspeed is   EVERYTHING    That is the biggest secret to making money  It's why people like Etup  ZiggyD  and Zizaran get so rich  There's no magic streamer sauce here  they just play a shitload and they try to clear quickly  Etup and Zizaran especially   Above all else  keep moving  and keep killing  Make sure you have a   very   strict filter  You don't want to be selling drops to the vendor more than every 2 3 maps  Don't pick up large chrome items   4 inventory slots   Depending on your mouse control  don't pick up Wisdoms Portals  just buy them or vendor Transmutes to get lots  Don't pick up rares outside of amazing bases and jewelery  Things like Vaal Regalia  Jewelled Foil  Hubris Circlet  etc  If it's not the best base in its category  don't pick it up  If it's a 2h weapon  probably don't pick it up  some people will argue against this one  but I've found it to be a huge waste of time    You want to be rolling the dice on your loot constantly  If you're not rolling the dice  you're missing out on opportunities for big drops  Don't fuck around between maps  If you're outside of a map for more than an average of 30 seconds  you're wasting time  When you need to perform a non clearing task  such as rolling maps   do it in bulk  Roll up 20 maps at a time if you can  This keeps your inventory time optimal  since you're not constantly running from the map device to your stash   Lastly  make sure you're built for clearspeed  If you rely on regular movement  make sure your boots are amazing  Make sure things like Chilled Ground can't slow you down  Make sure you clear packs in a second or two  and bosses in 10 seconds or less  If you can't do this  downgrade your map tiers until you can  It's ok to farm T8 10 maps  they still drop tons of currency    nbsp     Rolling maps     There's no big secret to rolling maps  outside of not wasting a ton of currency doing it  Don't Chisel below T13  it's simply not worth it  If you're broke and you fall down from T11 12s into T10s  just do a couple of blue T10s until that Shaped Strand drops and you can resume farming reds  There isn't some magical loot threshold  Shaped Dunes drops plenty of currency too  Once you've built up a currency base  just buy another 10 T11s if you fall  It'll actually be cheaper than Chiseling in the long run   When you roll  shoot for any pack size  That's all you really care about  If you don't get pack size  scour it  If you get something that disables your build  scour it  Lastly  I personally scour Temp Chains this league  With all the new prefixes I've found I can safely get away with this  and it just wastes a shitload of time to run it   As an aside  make sure your build is set up to be able to run the vast majority of mods  If you have more than 1 2 disabling mods  fix your build or run something else for farming    Apprentice and Journeyman Sextants are a huge help  Don't use more than one of each on a map though  Thanks to how insane Breaches are  I've mostly been able to sustain Sextants after building up a pool of 20 or so  It's rare that I don't see one of each of the lower tier Sextants drop every 3 maps  I sell my Master Sextants for now  since they're 4c on BHC  which is a nice boost   One last piece of advice  If you're on BHC  or really care about XP on BSC   watch out for nasty Breach mods  Things like Vuln   AoE down   Beyond can make Breaches deadly  Run these maps  but don't high five those hands      If you follow the instructions above  you will make currency  However  much like with gambling in real life  you'll have to ride out some bad RNG swings  Sometimes the game will screw you over repeatedly and you'll fall out of reds despite doing everything right  The richer you get  the lower the odds this will happen  and the less it will impact you  Just ride out the bad RNG and supplement it with some T10 map farming and you'll eventually be in a very good place

I briefly played Zeus Crane  vengeance paladin  worshiper of Selune  Goddess of the Moon  He referred to himself as the Sentinel  and rarely took off his helmet face plate  His symbol was that of an owl encompassed by the moon   Whenever it was my turn  often more than one of us would yell  "Zeus Crane " And whenever the DM tried to move a creature past me  I would yell  "Sentinel " One time the DM responded with  "You can't just say you're The Sentinel and do what ever you want "  I would do my best to be up front in battle with my halberd  Since I took the Pole arm Master and Sentinel feats  my stats were pretty low  I think I would have been better off with the standard array even   We played one low level campaign and it has been awhile  so I don't remember all the role playing stuff and character interactions  I did fight for justice and the unfortunate  rebelling against my rich noble parents for trampling on the poor  This garnered respect from the other players  especially being the first to put my life in harms way and being willing to fight to the death

There is no "one size fits all" setting  It's all personal preference  We have high sense players like noted who can do fantastic flicks with that high sensitivity and we have the exact opposite with KiXstar as examples  who uses a ridiculously low sense and is one of the fastest aimers in the game as well

You don't choose what to sacrifice until Victimize is done resolving  That means that the Gatekeeper's trigger can't go on the stack until you're done resolving Victimize  and have returned the two creatures   meaning those creatures you just returned are eligible to be sacrificed to the Gatekeeper's trigger

You saying it's a contradiction does not make it a contradiction  Once again  "Not yet" and "Who says I'm done fighting" are literally what she said  She never said she doesn't want to fight the White Fang anymore  She wasn't there to fight the White Fang  but she will fight them because she has to  Because they're right fucking there  Right there  with her family  Completely consistent  completely in character   I repeatedly explained all of the dots regarding how she's acting  You're just ignoring all of that and throwing your head in the sand every single time I point out a flaw in your reasoning and every single time I bring up an explanation that fixes what your issues are   You just don't want to see it  You only see "plot hole plot hole plot hole" and you're refusing to accept anything else

It's because as pretty much every aspect of the show improves  animation  voice acting  music  sound editing  and overall production   the writing has been getting worse  It feels like the script was rushed and no one went through the script character by character to make sure that everything each character does make sense based on their history  personality  and motivations   They only have 12  15 minute episodes per year to progress the story and it took half of them for anything meaningful to happen and even then  nothing has been particularly well written  Sure  they threw in some emotional Pyrrha moments that made people cry and then everyone blew their loads as to how good the show was so far this season

Team looks so much better with MCW out there  The ball pressure on the point guard is completely shutting down open shots from outside  
You have no form of progression  You're probably going in and doing the same exact set x rep scheme with the same weights week in and week out  Week to week you need to be progressing some way  wether it be more weight  more reps  an extra set  less rest between sets  etc  Learn to periodize training and I'm sure you will see a near immediate increase in strength 
Happy new year 
Not really  I've played close to 70 or so games now with the deck without nephy and it's been extremely easy to get to 8 mana with this deck  You  like so many others are just underestimating it because it's aim isn't hyper aggression   It's pretty prevalent and obvious this community doesn't understand what an actual control deck is and based on how the meta has been since this games conception  this doesn't really surprise me 
Excellent reference  
Happy New Year to all  Hopefully this year will be great for all  Fireworks at Edinburgh fantastic as always 
Great job OP  You look very polished

It seems likely  at least  A year ago Yoshida said pretty much the same thing about Blue Mage so it seems his idea on that hasn't changed at all  It was odd for him to bring it up during the Naoki's Room segment because the guy on stage with him didn't really ask about Blue Mage or even Beastmaster  so it's odd Yoshida would bring them up like that  especially if they're meant to be announced in February   It seems more likely he brought them up to deflect avoid talking about the guy who suggested Shogun Samurai  should be a tank for 4 0

This requires some sort of cheat detection   The reason they ban in waves is because they first have to figure out what major hack people are using  Then they have to find a way to detect who is using it  Then they add that detection to a patch and let it collect data for a while before sending out the ban wave   I'm sure this is how CIG will do it  but unless they already have a few people already devoted to developing cheat detection  it's not going to happen for a long  long time

Seriously   The game is the best looking game I have ever played before and I had fun playing it  It was worth the 60 bucks   Gamers loved to bitch about games they don't like 
I like Harambe for the sheer meta ness of it  Whenever something like Cecil the Lion happened the discussion was always that people were all worked up but would forget about it in a week  Harambe was just like what if people kept up the same crazy level of emotion for this animal well after the story had passed  The length of the meme was what made it so funny

Happy New Year Everyone and NO to Gambling   
Okay  I'll check out the parts I've missed when I see the update  Gonna try and answer what I can for now   4  From what I've been able to read  the issue is with lakeview manor wanting to add a children's bedroom  I believe you can remove items from the workbench  It's been ages since I did hearthfire  so I can't remember  Maybe if you remove all the items it will let you remove the whole wing  I have no idea so don't trust my word on that  definitely hard save before you try it  I can say that there are a total of 3 hearthfire homes you can build  so you can always try one of the others   5  Have you hired a steward  I know this isn't exactly the answer you are looking for  but I think the only way you can have a horse stay at your home is to hire a steward  and then have them purchase a horse for you  It will be a generic horse that will hang near the stable at your home  I don't think you can leave a horse purchased elsewhere there unfortunately  I could be wrong though   6  As far as I know this is a bug  and occurred because you completed The White Phial quest first  I believe if you did the thieves guild shit first and came back later things would have been fine      7  Sounds like a bug  no idea any way around this unless there is a mod available   8  I am unsure if anything differs for Xbox  but you should always have the option to load any hard saves  A lot of people  myself included  learn the hard way that hard saving is super important  Auto saves and quicksaves will overwrite the older one and keep only the most recent ones  so as not to use up all of your storage with a billion auto quick saves  When I learned my lesson I had literally never heard saved  so it was either one of my 4 most recent saves  or the automatic "prisoner" hard save when you create your character  I just started a new character  It is best to hard save after major points in the game  and maybe keep several hard saves for your character so you have a spot to go back to that you know is safe  Hard saves will never be overwritten unless you choose to overwrite them when doing a hard save  From the start menu you access the most recent saves  from the loading screen menu you should be able to access all hard saves as well as the most recent quick and auto saves   So overall  barring your first few questions being off the wall  I think you could probably continue on  You can build a different hearthfire house  buying another horse isn't really a huge deal  that is one of a billion different thieves guild radiant quests so it isn't such a big deal  I don't think it will have any real negative impact  And as long as you throw in some hard saves moving forward and keep several hard saves that you don't overwrite I think it would probably be okay  Overall I guess it is up to you on how important you consider the things you can't fix or workaround  I'll try and remember to check back for an update with the first couple questions  Hope I was somewhat helpful   Edit  fixed a couple typos and added a couple bits of clarification

Need to know more about you  Any debt  high interest   have an emergency fund  retirement fund  home  You should have high interest debt paid off and an emergency fund before investing  For investing I'd suggest sticking it in a low cost index tracker etc such as SPY  tracks s p 500  If your serious about investing then I'd read some articles on basic investing on investopedia  You got 6 main investing types with the stock market  Short term vs long term  Technical vs fundamental and lastly value vs growth

I mix together two  Guerlain Lingerie De Peau Natural Perfection Foundation SPF 20   Givenchy Teint Couture Blurring Foundation Balm Broad Spectrum 15  A small dab of each on the back of my hand and applied with a beauty blender  I used to use Make Up For Ever HD foundation but I recently got more involved in my skin care routine and through that realized I wasn't really loving the MUFE  Between some reasearch   samples from Sephora I decided I would give the high end ones a shot  They're definitely more than I would like to pay but I really do love the coverage  not too heavy but evens out my skin  and the feel of them when they're on  Plus  getting them from Sehora I knew that if I decided against either one after using them for a week or two that I could just return them

D3 breaking that barrier was part of its suicide   It exposed how shallow the game was from a character building perspective   It's environment  random events  and voice acting were some of its best features  even though there was still something left to be desired    Once you stripped the story and boss fights out  the game was doomed   Gearing each class for multiple specs was fast  and seasons got their laughably short lifespan   Removing cruel when 3 0 hits should help a great deal by itself   I am looking forward to that

Yeah I agree    They could have worded  it more nicely       Parents suck sometimes it's been a long time since I was a teenage girl    But my mom had stupid rules like I wasn't allowed to paint my nails  black  or dye my hair black because  black nails were trashy and black hair made me look like a bitch    Sometimes you just gotta suck it up and know where to pick your battles     I constantly got kicked  out of my parent house once I was 18 for not cleaning my room or not following the few  rules I had  Looking  back I should  have just followed the stupid rules  and  made everyone's  lives easier

  Sounds like completely made up bullshit to me     I thought so too  But there are people who literally believe that  The Muslims  The Black people  and all the other minority groups are taking all the "good White women"  These interracial relationships are also contributing to "White Genocide"  Because apparently for every interracial baby that is born  that is one less White baby that could have been born in it's place if that White slut didn't fuck a minority   Like seriously  hang around the Alt Right and Red Pill online social gatherings  The shit they say ranges from being hilarious to pretty fucked up 
What are you basing this on  I'm not saying you are wrong  I'm finding the game had very little information to go off storyline wise and interpreted it in the way I mentioned above  Although if I have missed more information from the game I'm happy to change  I quite like my idea as I feel it his a dark version of him completing his initial goal of cleansing the corruption and darkness from 2 million years ago whilst getting his revenge and being allowed to finally die and move on

I dunno about this  Born in 77   I didn't get a cell phone until I was 22  I really think it was more fun to grow up back when people spent more time face to face  4 player video games  driving around trying to find your buddies  More parties  the ability to be anonymous and less sjw nonsense etc

Let me tell y'all a story  This is from a young dumbass thundercat    I moved on my own last year  been trying to develop myself a bit so i grew fond of LSD  Well today i dropped a tab and went to Ripleys believe it or not and any other white people that been to ripleys know there's weird shit and weird people    They had this one two headed statue mcthingy  I got a picture of it  that I legit talked to for like 45 minutes  Out of the mirror maze  tribal mask  historical artifacts that'll make a man think in Ripleys this one really caught me today we talked about life and I know all these white ass moms sitting in me at ripleys knowing a brother on LSD  Now I'm alone not going to trap with my N    s due to me recovering  It's a dark world when you think short term my negro  Live life  Happy new years yall    Also went to the aquarium was dope  And fuck this title bro  Can I get myself a flair in here

That's because Witcher 3 wasn't trying to be a TES game  They're still quite different despite both having an open world   Bug reports would go a long way in helping  If a handful of hobbyists can maintain a bug tracker and slowly fix thousands of bugs  I'm sure a AAA studio can do it too   And no  they haven't  Turn off that cinematic camera thing for dialogue and you'll still get stuck when you try to enter Diamond City for the first time  It's been like that since launch  and it also happens in quite a few conversations in their latest DLC  So clearly  they don't care enough to fix it or figure out why it's happening in the first place

Finding a good bargain is often times what motivates me to purchase   My therapy of choice is going to yard sales vs  retailers   Yard sales are cash only and items are negotiable    Many items I find are in new or like new condition and I know my brands and buy quality items that have barely been used   Some of my best savings are on every day items such as cocktail napkins for   10 vs  3 99   No comparison to a MacAir vs a MacBook  however in the long run it's a win win if I find something useful that extends my budget for items that are purchased elsewhere

Because FMJ is effective enough and cheap  The military will make the standard gear whatever works and is cheapest  then issue more specialized expensive stuff as needed  A few cents per round makes a huge difference when you're talking the number of rounds the military needs  Plus they are looking at using essentially a hollow point in side arms in the future as standard issue  We abide by the Hague as a show of faith  but we never signed it

This whole myth hinges on using a different definition of "woman" than has always been used    It would be like saying "it isn't just human beings that can speak English   Dogs  birds  bees  sharks  and many other animals can speak English   All types of otherkin can speak English "  It's technically true if you define things pretty loosely

I used to regularly use Maybelline Dream Matte Mousse  which was a light medium coverage and feels great on your skin    Then I was using Estee Lauder Double Wear  which is full coverage and pretty good  though honestly not quite as full coverage as I'd personally like    Now I'm using a sample of Kat Von D Lock It full coverage foundation  which has pretty amazing coverage  but I'm having some issues with it with my dry skin right now  despite trying it with and without primer  and of course I always moisturize first  Really great coverage though  Once these samples are done  I'll go back to finish off the Double Wear

Of course it does  if you're "close" to  something   it's essentially part of your  identity   Insult this  something   and you seemingly insult those associated with that  something   They take it personally   Call it a family member  A religious belief  A political candidate  A country  A virtual game not winning certain awards        The problem is that this impedes constructive criticism  Encourages the tradition  even if they can't see the flaws

Zeratu is still really good the thing is that his rune requirement is one of the steepest in the game   He's not the greatest unit of all time anymore due to power creep but he's still decent   The only reason people think Zeratu sucks and is lackluster because they are so used to seeing those 100  CR   50  CD Zeratu with poor stats all around that are paper thin durability wise   Those G2 G3 Zeratus with the ones with 200  speed   140  CD   100  CR   and decent HP   DEF are nightmares to deal with

This is correct  the border between the preexisting sockets and the ones added by the jeweler orb can never be linked in the socketing process  This means that the best you can do is get a 5L and only by going from 1 socket to 6 and succeeding in linking together all of the added sockets   5 to 6 sockets does not work since the links on the 5 preexisting sockets do not change  it would have to have been already 5 linked

Yeah  Turn on cursor mode  The best thing remote viewer allows is fetching darts bolts  not using cursor mode   It was incredibly difficult to do anything besides afk nmz using guthans or splash on rats  I'd recommend sticking to bank standing skills if you must train as I haven't found a way to rotate your camera  maybe hackers keyboard   You can also turn down your computers  resolution to make it easier to see and reduce data usage 
With melee you can't use Yak to bank items which is like 10k less per kill  I don't know how much limbs are  but if they're around 9 6m  you're literally throwing away over 2m gp hr  And I think 220  KPH is possible with hardcore tribriding and some tweaks to my strategy  including picking up drops  but I don't have a working gaming setup at the moment to test   In other words  7 2m gp hr vs 9 6m gp hr  assuming 190 KPH with melee and 200 KPH with tribrid  The lower limbs  the greater the discrepancy grows 
   That means you're going to be sitting there  stabbing slept targets for over 20 seconds trying to build up something that Saryn could have done in about 4 seconds  Not to mention the energy cost on that is ridiculous   While what you say is true in the earlier portions of the game  you can't exactly tonkor lvl 200 enemies and expect them to die immediately  especially if they're heavies  This is the reason you don't covert lethality the small fry  similar to ash  You target the Heavies  the ones which have the most absurd hp scaling compared to the rest of the enemies  About 2 3 should be able to clear the entire room

MCW with the court vision  y'all 
Not 100  sure about all 3  However I believe that all of those abilities  which are point and click  track the target until it connects  and only then the effect is triggered  So as Sylvanas moves faster than the Bytcher Varian Diablo  they still keep track until the ability connects  If the target is unstoppable at the time of the effect triggering  it will do nothing  But Sylvanas can not be impacted during the flight  as she is much faster in mid flight  So she will be hit after the flight  And as she is no longer Unstoppable  she will get stunned slowed displaced

This was a shockingly rare viewpoint during nominations  When nominees were revealed I had a lot of discussion on  r terraria with people who thought five years was a totally fucking reasonable time frame  Sure I got 200  upvotes for saying I essentially didn't agree with Terraria's nomination  wasn't expecting to stay above zero tbh  but everyone who actually engaged and commented seemed to think it was such a very long time  and that Skyrim and Terraria both deserved to be nominated  Most of the arguments went along the lines of 'I can see myself playing this for many years because it's such a good game'  Well I'm glad you're so confident in your psychic powers  but the rest of us aren't voting on hypothetical future awards    
Theres far more points than you ever actually need though in 2  You just may have to do an extra side quest or two  
I think that  yes while graphics and some gameplay elements have improved  they've downright removed some like crafting spells from Morrowind Oblivion    Or seem to change things that needed tweaking not overhauling like Fallout's levelling system that they threw away in favor of a poorly thought out  boring perk based system   That  and they've added unnecessary gameplay mechanics which take away from the focus of the games and make them seem "lazy"  see the ridiculous amounts of radiant quests in Fo4 over actual handcrafted quests   or focus way too much on crafting mechanics  see the half baked settlement building mechanic  that take away from what could have been   And then there's the quality of writing that's noticeably dropped since Morrowind  can't speak for Oblivion as I've never played it   You need only compare Morrowind's main quest to Skyrim's to see a massive difference  with one actually doing something interesting with the idea of a chosen one that you actually have to  earn   compared to Skyrim where you're the dragonborn 20 minutes into the game    boring and disappointing in comparison  That also leads to another point of Bethesda seemingly being obsessed with giving the player awards for doing fuck all so early on  and then allowing you and at times forcing you to become the leader of bloody everything even if it doesn't make sense   Then of course there's the Fallout games  and arguably Fo3 and 4's main stories are far less interesting or thought put as Fo1 2 New Vegas  the latter in which imo is by far the best Bethesda open world RPG since Morrowind    And it wasn't even made by Bethesda   because for some reason Bethesda love going for shitty "find your family member" narrative hooks in their Fallout games  even though they don't have that issue at all in their TES games   Sorry for the rant  I could go on forever  particularly on the writing story    But the point is  while it is easy to point out improvements over the last game  like the graphics are better and so is the shooting   I think it is even easier to point out massive problems in the way Bethesda has been designing their games lately  For their Fallout games especially  they're moving from RPGs to sandboxes  which I do not want  I don't personally play Fallout to build shitty pointless settlements and then be given radiant quests to clear out areas to I can build more shitty radiant quests  I play Fallout for interesting factions  quests  areas and NPCs  There's a clear direction that Bethesda is taking its open world games  and I don't like it in the slightest

Uh  you want at least one  probably two  3 is too much imo  She's important because Dimension Shift is 18 PP to play  and you need it in your hand ASAP so you can start reducing the cost as you play spells  She searches you 2 spellboost cards and then spellboosts them when she attacks  So you evolve her and attack  and then she dies because she is a must kill   DShift is really spell heavy and follower light so your evolves are reserved for her and Levi  and maybe a Flame Destroyer if it will give you lethal     You could play without her  but you'll be less consistent because adding a Merlin is like running 2 more chances to draw DShift  which is what makes the deck possible   She's 3500 vials to craft  or she comes in classic basic standard whatever packs  if you want to try your luck  The packs that arent DE or RoB

6s are my favorites by far  Like others said  I didn't like these at first but grew to like them the more I looked closely at pictures  They look much better in your picture than the initial promos as well  I got them through SNKRS  Are they easy to get in stores 
Honestly  Because weapon customization is in almost every shooter and if it wasn't in siege people would complain  In my personal opinion I wish there was a lot less customization  a sight choice between a red dot and an acog  and choice between a suppressor or not  I don't think most people share my opinion though  People like have more choices 
Same  For how little I use anything besides an AR  the grind just isn't worth it for me 
doesn't take as much as you're making out to be  Obviously during cutscenes loading I don't sit there with my eyes glued to the screen or ever for that matter  It's only when I'm actually doing something in the inventory I focus on it  Shit man  if you care for what you've earned and gained then you would put at least some attention into what you're doing  right   Like if you spent 2 weeks on an assignment project   you'd make sure you looked after it on the way to submission  wouldn't you  Because that's your work  you worked hard for it  I'm not being a jerk  I'm being honest  not my problem you don't have the same opinion of earned items as I do  and it certainly doesn't make me a jerk

Alternatively  it gets people to try new builds   E g  "well I want to upgrade my striker  but rng keeps handing me firecrest so I guess I'll try that out in the meanwhile "  Yeah re gearing is a pain  but in my experience upgrades come in time   I'll toss in a "fuck that" when it comes to re farming these named gear pieces though  even if I take the same stance when it comes to farming them up in the  first  place     not today rng  not today

I too have the elite controller  I'd like to say that using all 4 paddles makes the learning process much faster  Maybe not easier but faster indeed  I suggest that you use all 4 paddles and keep your thumbs on the analog sticks  It's been 4 to 5 days since I recieved the elite controller and so far I'm hardly making any mistakes in pressing the wrong paddles  Of course if you're new to scuffs the first 2 day will be very "raging" if I do say so my self   I very much suggest that you try out all 4 paddles for a week or 2     PS  Do make sure you have the paddles on correctly       
Military has a get up or get out formula   Low chance of staying on the career path for even a decade and an aggressive maximum age for enlistment  It really results in a young average age so this doesn't really surprise me

It's one of my favorite weapons  Yeah it may be a bit underpowered  but you have to play it like you would play the KBAR  You also have to remember about the dual wielding mode  It's really helpful when you just need some extra fire power up when going into really close quarters areas like indoor areas of Genesis  Also  put a sight in it at all times  The iron sights are annoying  My favorite attachments are quickdraw  elo  fusion mag  because it runs out of ammo so fast   and particle amp  so you can reach out and touch someone if you need to   Also  run dexterity  gung ho  for the dual wield mode  and scavenger  They are essentials on any Type 2 class

Happy new year people from the future  Whats 2017 like 
My great grandpa told me this joke a couple years ago  It really is a good one  
I switched over from LoL two years ago  My initial feeling was similar to what you say in your post  I have since learned that the aim in this game shifts a little  to picking a good addition to your team composition  instead of total mechanical mastery of one champion   For that  a certain number of heroes are required  I would feel comfortable on about 15   There are other ways to have fun at the game  though  this is just my view   What I think is important   1  All draft modes require you to pick to fit the team  Expecting to play exactly one hero is  imho  the wrong mindset  We have QM for that   2  The meta is not as rigid as people think  At any time  there is only a very small handful of heroes that will elicit a negative reaction  For example  I would today expect a raised eyebrow at Tyrande  Tassadar  Medivh  maybe Stitches  unjustified imo  and Murky  plus Aba   TLV  Although teams are very different  and many have no problem with Aba  Tassadar or Medivh at all  However  this is a guide for improvement  It is easy to imagine that picking Rexxar instead of Muradin or Johanna can well be a source of lost games  and it is important to realize this    3  Every player will at some point try out the cheap heroes  This is not only useful if you want to play them yourself  but also to understand their strengths and weaknesses  I used to consider Muradin too boring to play  He is not 
Let me know what you think of the first story mission when you get to playing it  If the multiplayer affected you so much  I'm intrigued to hear what you'll think of that  it's intense to say the least   
As long as GGG allows listing items without intention to sell them  shit like that will happens   They promote Premium Tabs and the Trading API  but between fake listing for price manipulation  AFK sellers and people to busy to sell low values items  I'm starting to prefer to avoid completely any trading in this game

For BLM  Spell Speed and Crit are your big stats to get  as SpS affects how many Fire 4s and all you can cast quickly  while Crit lets you get those sweet 10k  hits   As for relic    lets see     The initial 170 step can take a few hours depending on how lucky you get with crystal drops  the 2nd step  if you have a friend who can help run stuff unsynced  would also take only a few hours tops  3rd step requires 40 tokens and 16 items  the items purchaseable by GC seals or made by crafting  while the tokens can be done by beast tribe  maps  Alex Gordias runs  or buying with tomes  lore and poetics   With it being nerfed from the original 80 16 HQ  I wanna say it won't take nearly as long  depending on how much time you devote to it     a few days to maybe a few weeks tops  The Aether Oil step takes 5 weeks if done casually  and preferably  because the only other option is to spend 1800 lore each  and that lore is better spent for the stuff for Step 5 while you are getting Aether Oil from Crystal Tower  The umbrite step  depending on how much lore you earn  can be a few days or a few weeks  And finally  at a casual rate  you can finish the current last step  the singing cluster step  in 3 weeks or less depending on if you only run the weekly and daily quests  or if you also spend lore on singing clusters  which are half the price of an umbrite         Total time investment at this point  probably at least 2 months  Casually  Less if you go into hardcore grind mode running only ARF for lore  and are capped on lore and poetics going into step 3  capped on lore going into step 5

    The thing is I can't tell if your joking or haven't noticed that the Games industry has a particular interest in pandering to the people who demand every game be a magnum Opus of storytelling  Granted no game actually is that  but they try so hard at it  The push is so strong that when the new doom inserts a ton of story into a game about shooting demons we cheer about how little story it has   Games are so story focused these days that we have lost our perspective of what a game without story looks like

I'm certainly not arguing that the pricing is palatable anywhere in the Apple line right now   it's pretty bad   Personally  I'm about ready to jump ship to Linux when the opportunity for a new computer presents  I don't appreciate vendor lock when Microsoft does it  and I'm not going to put up with it from Apple either 
 This is why chess is considered very skillful   because everybody has perfect information   I'm sorry   what   There are a finite number of moves you can make in chess  You have a series of openings and when someone moves a piece  you eliminate every opening that doesn't involve the piece that moved and then select the likely one and run a counter to it  Chess is a arguably a game of  knowledge  more than it is a game of intuition  The player with more knowledge about chess tactics and stratagems will always win  The only place you can even suggest it's a player of skill and potentially evolve the game and create a new opening by altering the movement of a piece or two is at the absolute top level  The literal 0 01   But other than that it's pure rote learning of the opening  move and its counter     I'm justifying RPF by saying that people shouldn't be AFKing at the back like you say so much   Nobody said to AFK  He said to wait 20 seconds and see how everything pans out in that time before sailing into the cap rather than sailing into it right away and running face first into a Gearing  The enemy isn't going to cap in the 10 or 20 seconds you take to assess the situation in front of you  there's no need to dash into it straight away  If you see a Gearing on the enemy teamlist you're also going to be more cautious until he's spotted  you're going to have your exit strategy planned  have friendlies and hard cover you can dive behind  and  be sailing almost parallel to the cap so the rate of closure is minimised in case you  are  spotted  You don't just load into the game  stick it on full throttle to the nearest cap and hope for the best    This isn't a removal of skill  because it gives you more information  It gives more information to all available parties     You literally know where the closest person is at all times    Instead of tracking movements and predicting their target and optimal path and then laying an ambush  you have that stupid semicircle pointing you in the right direction and you can blindly sail after away from them  There's no possibility to outplay someone when it gives you realtime information  If someone already has developed the skill of predicting DD movements and torp paths   then this skill is beyond broken   I tried it on the PTS and I literally didn't even need to think  There were one or two moments when my friend had the skill and I didn't where the DD would have juked me because I misread the direction the torps were coming from  they'd crossed over while they were travelling to me so it looked like they were staggered like he was sailing away from me instead of like he'd turned and the torps had crossed each other  I thought the torps had come in like ' ' instead of a very shallow 'X'   I would have sailed north but my division mate had the damn pointer and confirmed he was sailing south  At that point  I look at my map  see the CV and go "he's going there" and just sail straight there  I didn't even need to think about chasing the guy because I knew his current location and his most likely target  I intercepted him with plenty of time to spare and didn't even bother using hydro to dodge torps because I knew exactly when and where they'd be coming from    This 4 point skill absolutely kills stealth gameplay  It's completely dead  there's no way around it  There's no "we both have information now" because this game is largely about positioning yourself so you have a battle that utilises friendlies and terrain to give yourself as many advantages as possible  Thinking 5 steps ahead and out thinking your enemy is a big part of the game    The reason stealth on torpboats is so powerful is because it allows them to put themselves into unexpected positions to launch a full volley  If you know that you're spotted in a DD and he's in a certain direction  you'd literally have to be AFK to still be hit  let alone surprised   You know  it's when CCs say stuff like this  the average potato latches onto it and starts repeating it like it's fact  RPF breaks the game in a whole new way  You may as well make all ships spotted from the start because this skill completely nullifies that aspect of the game  The core of chess and any other competitive game is luring the enemy into a situation where you're better or where they're going to make a mistake  Anything that removes someone's ability to do that lowers player skill 
Hahaha
 Vorthos was pissed  The storyline went from being brutalized by a Wibbly Wobbly Timey Whimey asspull conclusion to Khans block  "All of our rules about time travel and how it works    don't matter  Cause we say so "  and then they do this horrible mess of "Gatewatch"  Nissa crying for Ashaya multiple times every article  Gideon getting throughly beaten by a 3 inch deep puddle of water  Ob Nixilis doing more moustache twirling than Snidely Whiplash  Ugin basically yelling "Don't do the thing "  Jace basically yelling "I'm doing the thing "  and then the "biggest  baddest" threat to all the mulitverse is killed by a channel fireball combo    You have no clue  The biggest fuck up was with the hedrons   The eldrazi and the hedrons used to be so cool and strange  They used to be some sort of ancient mechanism that awoke  with  the eldrazi    Hedron Matrix     Dreamstone Hedron    but they got retconned into eldrazi repellant    Lithomancer's focus    Such an interesting part of the world and they just ruined it with bfz

It really doesn't even apply that well to the way CS GO plays  You can't complete a match of CS GO in 5 minutes  and in competitive it's not like you can just leave  at least without penalty  Whereas in CIV you can actually lose track of time and think that you'll quit despite continually pressing that "Next Turn" button

How can you be hating in retirement age people  At least us millennials knew we had to go to college  When my parents were growing up we still had a strong economy and working hard manual labor was an economically sound decision  Now their trades have moved overseas and they're too old to start over in something new and they don't have any savings to retire  They worked their ass off for decades and they have nothing to show for it  Generation X got fucked a lot harder than us

I agree  I'd preferred if  instead of Multiclass  it was just called "Warrior Assassin" or "Support Assassin"  The bruiser warriors all are a mix of assassin  and supports with more DPS to them as well  There's also certain specialists who can be that too   Better naming might be just for some to be called Bruiser Warriors  Bruiser Assassins  Offensive Supports  Offensive Specialists or in Zarya's unique case  Supportive Warrior   There's a lot of additional names  which ofcourse might over complicate things  Still  the game should do a better job in trying to emphasis on how it's hard to simplify all these heroes with so few categorized roles or by one simple name and whether they are melee or ranged

On a more serious note  I wish that Jagex would release raids for 45  even if at a later date  Jagex said updates on the main game would happen for DMM too  I feel like it's silly to disable content just because it's in an instance  especially when other instances on DMM already exist  Zulrah is a popular pk spot even though it's an instance  People can be killed while heading to an instance  And I'd imagine for raids  battles in the lobby would be a common occurrence    W45 DMM has been out for over a year now  there are plenty of players that have accounts that can use end game content  The release of the gear and weapons from raids would definitely spice up DMM  I can understand Mod Ash's concerns with spending time in instances on seasonals which only last 4 weeks  but world45 isn't going anywhere    And on top of that  runescape is so popular because you can play the game however you want it  Mod Ash  I'm sorry but you're wrong here  I think you should stop trying to dictate the way people play on a gamemode you don't play or try to update  
they kinda just say 3 0 and 3 1 some time in 2017   with SQ42 maybe ending up in 2018  I sometimes wish english had an equivalent of maths order of operations when it comes to listing items    "3 0 is scheduled for 3 months" kinda sounds like you mean you think we are getting 3 0 in 3 months  But NET it is

There are many ways     You can farm wyverns by the Rock of Ravatogh but it's best to have the Ring of Lucii for quick kills   You also get a lot of gil this way   You can do the expiracast route which is what I did   You just gather up rare coins and use 8 as a catalyst   Find any monster and use all the spells up   Most guides for this suggest using Bandersnatch but it doesn't really matter   I did wolves until night and then used the rest on iron giants   The menace dungeons will get you quite a lot of exp   I think I was just messing around in Daurell Caverns with the 50  exp boost and came out with over 200K exp

No  TF2 is the more popular game  Just look at the playercounts   The difference is that TF2 doesn't have a community like Skyrim  Valve are catering to the hyper casual crowd  People who can't afford other shooters and just want to download it and take a look  maybe occasionally play  What Valve have turned the game into is like one of these mobile games  Low quality  quick games  easy to access  easy to spend money on  That's what TF2 is now  And that doesn't leave space for a real community  Does Candy Crush clone  5320 have a community  Of course not   And that's why TF2 lost  Not because it's less popular  but because it doesn't have a community anymore

The notion that we Millennials think we're "special" and "entitled" is a load of horse manure and has become one of those BS "truths" that gets regurgitated endlessly by the ignorant  IMO it is a myth with it's origins in taking the attitudes of whiny upper middle class Millennials in the Left Coast and the Northeast Corridor as that of a whole generation

I've worked with 5 or 6 different cremation companies over the years  Even the "worst" of them I dislike because they're cold and businesslike  ashes returned in a plain tin can  hard to reach a real person  that kind of thing   but they absolutely return the correct ashes and do exactly what they claim to    I worked with one guy that ran the business but didn't own the crematory  he tried to buy it  they wouldn't sell   and he personally picked up the bodies  supervised each cremation personally  and hand delivered the ashes to the owners at home  usually having coffee with them and talking about memories of their pets while there  He died of bladder cancer a few years ago and left the business to his apprentice  who was the only person he trusted to do it right  She's hired on more people  but makes sure they have the same personal touch he did    It's not a glamorous business  Most people are in it because they truly care  There's some exceptions of course  but they're a small minority  
They did this 2 years ago on Christmas  now they do it before the new year Great

Haha  that's awesome  I remember my first flawless  Although I don't remember it in as much detail  I'll tell you what I remember  My dad  an online friend  and me were up against a triple striker Titan team on momento  The other team was pretty good at sniping  not better than me  not trying to be cocky  but could often get picks on my teamates  We got down 0 4  and this was when we had 7 wins  Then we won our first round of the match  A glimmer of hope  Then we won again  Then again and again  4 4  my heart is trying to escape my chest  I go down  We get a pick  I get rezed  They get rezed  I get picked again  Overtime  My dad and my friend get a pick while 3 of them are on the point  They get another  They focus down the last and we win the match  And then the last match when we were on 8 wins we smashed the other team because all of us were so hyped  First flawless loot I got was a pre nerf doctrine with counterbalance  Exactly what I wanted  Felt so good and took forever for me I fall asleep that night cause I was still so hyped

Apocalypse is my gold standard for magic mods  It's on Nexus   Generally speaking I'd advise a focus on conjuration and destruction to start with  All the spell schools have their place  but early on at least I think it's more important to get some raw damage output going  and conjuration   minions   extra meatshields and drawing aggro away from you  You're a mage  you're squishy  you need all the backup you can get  Once you get a level or ten under your belt  and better spells than just Flames  you can afford to be a bit more reckless  but the path of a mage is a bit rough at the beginning   If you're  really  hankering for a physical attack  you can use Bound Sword Battleaxe Bow Dagger in a pinch   Bound Bow is adept level though  so you'll have to wait a while before anyone will sell it to you even if you want to be a sneaky archer mage thing    Quiet Casting  or whatever the perk is called  also applies to shouts  hilariously enough   The vanilla master spells generally aren't worth it due to their dual hand nature and long cast time  Modded master spells are better about this   Frozen Orb from Apocalypse is my personal favorite    Enchantments for reduced spell cost are generally more worthwhile than boosted mana capacity or regen  The main drawback is that there's no general "all spells cost X  less to cast" enchantment  they specialize by school  so if you like using a bit of everything it can get a bit annoying   The College of Winterhold quest line yields some good mage focused gear  This is probably obvious but it needs to be said  The faculty there are also the  only  source of expert and master level spells in the game  in case you didn't know  Court wizards only stock up to adept level   Master spells come with strings attached though    you need to complete a quest once you hit level 90 in the respective school before they'll sell them to you    I don't normally bother RPing my character  but it's still really funny to do Cidhna Mine as a mage  They make a big deal out of stripping you of all your gear   but you're a mage  Can't strip your spells  Feel free to go on a rampage once you're in there   Lastly  magic doesn't scale very well in vanilla  Your main method of getting stronger is by getting better spells  but there's no way to upgrade the spells themselves once you have them like there is with tempering weapons and armor  Mods can help with this  thankfully

  They are harder to spoof only certain hardware is works well with it  ask wifi hackers      Mac addresses are 48 bit and manufacturers aren't assigned one manufactor code recycling happens when manufacturers aren't doing their job properly  It occurs rarely as incompetence not a fact of life     You could have the mac address and a hidden piece of information  salt  work together to sign a key if anyone spoofed a Mac it would break the key and would not be a valid MAC so spoofing would not work     Having multiple hardware seed a finger print is possible but more risky as it is more likely one piece of the set would be switched out  also it doesn't solve spoofing or anything anyway

I'm not disappointed by it  I think that the season thus far could have been better but I don't agree with a lot of your complaints   Jaune is Ruby's foil  you can't just look at it as 'he's talking more which means Ruby is talking less ' How Jaune is handling what has happened is in direct contrast to how Ruby is  she's acting like everything is normal and gunho while he's trying to move on and is more aware of the situation   Also what does it matter how many lines people have  what they are saying with the lines is way more important 
In the game  many servants talk about their past battles like Arturia talked about Gil in one of her My Room line so it's likely they remember  Cu doesn't have any line about FSN tho but he does have a vague line saying "How many times I've been summoned  Yet this is my first as Caster" so it's the most he hinted being summon other times

Well  Technically it's not incorrect since there is both a new year  and new years after that  
You mean the first stages  I caught a level 30 Charmander with a regular curve  no berry  I've been getting really lazy with catching them  and I don't care that much if they break out  Especially because I caught a wild Charizard  so I don't really need too many more  I'm lying  I need a dozen Charizards before I can be happy  
what is fun then  playing greedy decks and being salty for losing  And just ignore the downvotes 
I don't live in a state that allows that unfortunately
I play in DC and Montgomery County MD and have been playing since the game came out   I've caught five wild Lapras all at the same place FDR Monument   My team and I scan almost the whole county and DC area and the ONLY place we have seen wild Lapras is there   It's definitely the rarest pokemon for us

Lot of judgment here   I wouldn't end my relationship with my sister best friend if she married a cold blooded killer   I would express my disapproval  of course  but none of us are perfect    why should I end my friendship because she made a bad decision   Seems insane to me     My old best friend is an extreme hippie now and has always had a very kind  old soul   Not smart at all but not a mean bone in her body   She ended up with a horrible guy for years    he was in the KKK  extremely racist  sexist  and abusive   I had no intention of ending the friendship over it because I wanted to look out for her  but things got really messy when he started harassing and threatening me     A close friend of mine ended our 20 year friendship because she thought my husband was racist   She wasn't right at all  but even if she was  I don't understand that way of thinking     If a friend starts making horrible life decisions we may naturally grow distant  but when someone is truly my friend they have my unconditional love despite bad life choices   Edit  anyone want to explain the downvotes  I would like to discuss it

Is it fair to think the Jews are so deeply entrenched in America if he went full Adolf and kicked them all out things might get chaotic  I honestly don't think America could go from Obama to a "Jew less government"  I don't know  I'm not saying that he is aware of the JQ or even that he cares but I mean did anyone honestly think he would could tell them to fuck off right out of the gate  At this point he could be great or he could be a Jewish puppet  either way I think it was a step in the right direction

Having an "official" Discord is something we are considering and have considered in the past   It wasn't done in the past because we only had a few mods and were busy enough with just the sub   We've gained a few mods since then so that alone makes it possible   However  there is the question of need   Many groups teams have their own Discord or other VOIP servers  many don't use an external VOIP program and rely on the in game VOIP  if any   As someone mentioned already  the existing Discord server linked on the sidebar is not very active   Put those together and it makes it hard to justify the effort in starting maintaining one   That's not to say we won't  but if we do have one  we want to make sure it is done right and useful for the community

I feel i should have used magic   ive beaten the game  gotten all the trophies  Got the damn Zwill daggers  that fight was painful   I just have 5 of the post game dungeons left to finish  Really not looking forward to costlemark from what people say     i found the original costlemark dungeon to be mindnumbingly frustrating literally falling to the pit of daemons 6 times and just getting destroyed   But ive only ever casted expericasts  I found their magic tutorial was kindve weak and i didnt really understand it and it seemed like a chore to craft all that crap for 3 casts each  But after i watched someone kill niglfar  or whoever that pricks name is that nets u zwill  on youtube    he did it in half the time and used 1 8th of the mega phoenixs it required me  And i was 20 levels higher than him and he didnt seem that smart with his combat techniques other than he used magic and i didnt      i find promtos only ability that is of use is the original one that lowers defence  But even then i usually choose to send gladio in with the downhammer for 9999 damage anyways   And i agree i loved this world and the characters  This game was great i thought  loved the idea of the story  A few execution glitches in it but other than that this has been one of my absolute favourite final fantasys to play

It's a common issue in comics  unfortunately  Most of the comics I get now are from IDW  and even they are getting into some dumb shit like this  Namely because they can't seem to grasp the concept that sexless robots can't have sexual identities   Take  for example  when a mad scientist turned Arcee into a female  All I could think was "wait   what does that actually change " And now there are 'gay' couples in Transformers  which irks me in the sense   they are physically incapable of having sex  how can they have a homosexual relationship      There's also lots of flirting  To what ends  who knows  because Hasbro will never allow them to go that last final step of allowing Transformer sex      TL DR IDW is full of degenerates

Well  I think not destroying the Tower has to do with it being a hub world and still a vital area to the game   Now if this was single player hub world I imagine it would be easier to do   For an always online  shared world  It's a bit trickier   Unless they had a special instance system for it that showed as you played through certain events of the campaign

    At the start of 2016  my 1 5 year old kitten was hit by a car and died while I was abroad with my parents                That is not where I thought this was going         Italian game store and bought me a Duel Deck  Eldrazi v Zendikar                Were you able to read it           800 commons and uncommons  insisting that I take them for free because they'd just have to throw them away                  Sounds about right       Anyways  I'm glad your first experiences with this great game were so positive  Welcome to the community 
Yeah my Pikachu medal count is at 73 now and it was around 24 tops when this started   I don't even hunt them down any more   just catch them if they pop up locally   and sometimes not even then if I'm trying to collect stops or something   I've had at least 5 pop up at my house 
Are you sure For Men Only is helpful  have read the last chapter since this was posted  Note   Ramsay is great for finance but this other book by "Shaunti" and Jeff Feldhahn has this at 12  in   "After several months as an embedded male  I was watching a movie with Shaunti one night  Halfway through  I casually mentioned that I didnt like the way one of the female characters was treating another  Shaunti sat up on the couch  grinned  and said  Youre thinking like a girl  Now  she meant it as high praise  but in the small midwestern town where I grew up  that kind of talk could get a guy slugged  But then I realized  maybe I had learned a valuable thing or two about the female universe just by listening in  Heres hoping that you do too "

It´s your preference really  But i´d say for shooters either Shadow warrior 2 or Doom  For something more strategic civ 4 5 or Xcom 1 2  For more story driven games try any Telltale games like walking dead or game of thrones  For an open world rpg i would recommend Bethesda games like Fallout or The Elder Scrolls  Witcher wouldn´t hurt either  But you didn´t specify what you like so just look through the offers steam has at the time  
Thanks

Yeah I mean you seemed insistent on me having an explanation for the shit so I just threw out some half assed conspiracy  The point being it's still a better explanation than pizzagate   Because even a retarded idea is more plausible   Somehow the simple answer that I don't know and neither do you was unacceptable  So I threw out a rock stupid conspiracy

    Advice for picking and hiring a Social Security Disability lawyer     With some not so gentle coaxing i've decided to try to apply for SSD for mental health issues  I've never had to hire a lawyer before  What should i look for  Someone who specializes in SSD obviously  Is there anything in specific i should look for beyond that        Some bit of info on the situation just in case it helps   I've already filed by myself and was automatically denied for making too much money substantial gainful activity   I had just given up then but with more family prodding i looked into it a bit more and decided it was something a lawyer should help me with  It is currently 2 weeks since my denial  I'm Male and 34  I'm still working and holding on as best i can at work  If the lawyer advises it i can quit immediately  I also have an appointment with my family doctor next week and he may or may not tell me to stop working  But i want a lawyers advice before i do anything  Thanks for your time  And if any additional information is needed just say

2nd alucard may even be better than the bloodhungry    2 marys will be rough  but you will at least get a feel for the deck  Often games are won with mary  If you only have two you will have to make sure that you have a combo in hand every time you play her  not just play her on 5 to contest the board when you are in a bad spot  If you are down to 2 mary I would recommend a second wardrobe raider  That way you at least are better early so you can last to set up your mary combos

I think you might have "catch" and "flee" confused  First is whether or not the pokemon breaks out of the ball  Second is if it runs away when doing so    Like abra has a pretty high catch rate  but a 99  flee rate  So if you don't catch it on your first ball  it's probably going to run  
If it's not playable in any formats  it's just a fancy collectible  I'm guessing that most of the players that get it would just keep it as a trophy  Since the supply and the demand are both so low  it'll be a matter of negotiation between the player who won it and the collector who wants it

Alchemy is based on the preconceived notion that matter can be transformed into other matter  for example lead in to gold  In science you don't start with a preconceived notion  you start with facts and results from previous finding to form new idea that can be proven or dis proven by experiments    Or in other words he had a reasons to create his universal gravity theory  he did not have any for alchemy

In general  that is a reasonable list of criticism of religion  although many more criticisms can be made   I can give you 3 corrections for your list     1   Since these early versions of the bible are much earlier than Christianity  it is wrong to say that an early version of the bible "puts the Christian God first"   It puts the Jewish God first   It is a Jewish religious text  it is not about Christianity   2   The story of Noah's Ark was not stolen from the Egyptians  but from the Babylonians  specifically the Epic of Gilgamesh   3   In your statement "I also tried to tell them that alot of the 'smarter' believers that study the bible their whole life accept that the adam and eve story is most likely not true  and they also except alot of the evolution stuff" you are using "accept" and "except" as meaning the same thing  which they don't   The word you should be using in that sentence is accept    One of my own biggest complaints is that if it is true that God wishes to be worshipped and obeyed  God should make His existence more obvious  which would be quite easy for Him to do   God should have an office in New York  should appear on TV talk shows  should perform miracles on a daily basis  should answer His email  and so forth   There would then be no difficulty in believing in God   As it is  He appears to be in hiding   Some people spend their whole lives searching for Him   I could understand this if God really did not care about the human race  but supposedly God  wants  us to believe in Him   The Problem of Evil is also very significant  but it is too complicated a topic for me to add to this comment   I did recently comment about it at length   if you are curious  I can send you my essay as a private message

Nobody needs to point out FNV's flaws  everyone knows that ofc it has flaws  Just because people say "I liked FNV far more than Fo4"  they are  not  saying that FNV's perfect  The simple fact that it's on the gamebyro engine is pretty much all you need to say to sum up FNV's issues  
Put simply  it's how much of a time buffer the client stores for event updates   That is  how much time will be rewound to find missing updates if your client is missing them   Now this sounds great in theory but a side effect of having a high interp is your projectiles come out with more of a delay  which makes it basically literally impossible to play any projectile class effectively since you're working with a large delay     0 03 is the default interp  which is absolutely horrendous for playing projectile classes   The widely accepted best network settings nowadays is to have cl interp on 0  which will actually set it to its minimum value  something like 0 00152  and cl interp ratio on 2   With these  you should be pretty good for all classes

I know about the lines thing  Yang has probably had the most going on this volume but she's barely been in it  I just wanted tho post it anyway   Edit  I'm coming back to this now cus I just realised I'm right anyway cus Jaune is getting loads more focus than Ruby regardless of the number of lines which he happens to have more of this volume  What a coincidence

My experience is completely different with unranked  The first time I tried it was maybe a week ago  Our first pick was Raynor but three of our team's players  a group  started flaming the first away for "a stupid pick" and kept calling him names all game long even though we managed to win  I tried to explain the bug to them and took the side of the Raynor to no avail   In ranked most people I've had in my team tend to follow the scene more so they know Raynor is bugged and what works even without the bugs  Lately I've even had pretty damn good luck with my teammates  No reason to report really anyone  Good communication from the get go and so on   I am honestly quite surprised by the difference I personally have experienced lately because I thought unranked would be more understanding and relaxed queue where you can experiment a bit more with your picks whereas HL would be harsher place where people want you to pick only meta heroes  Yet it turned out to be the opposite  Though I admit I haven't been playing very much yet after a half a year break so the sample size is still rather small  p

My main reasonhere is that Halo 5 has to make enormous graphical downgrades compared to destiny to get 60fps on the xbox one  and it has dynamic FPS black magic going on so everything going on in the distance is moving at 30fps  Bungie will have to reduce the graphics quality in order to hit 60fps on consoles  and they've already said they aren't going to do that  
I'm surprised that WF tried to restrict you  We used our HELOC for all sorts of things  none of which ever had anything to do with improving our property  The biggest things were a rental property downpayment  buying stocks  and an emergency fund  I really loved having one  looking forward to getting one on our new house

That was surprisingly easy to get  Do you know if that weapon is better than iron duke  It has two more damage and is strong against daemons but I don't really understand the iron duke enchantment  Regardless they're both better than the great sword you can buy from the vendor  Thanks a lot

Happy New Year guys      
  regret not maintaining the product ecosystem   I think they're doing the bare minimum to maintain the  ecosystem  as they see it   The cornerstone products still exist   iPhone  iPad  Apple TV  cornerstone of Homekit  Macs need not apply for the job   and yes the Mac if you want a computer that plays nice with iCloud and connected apps     Handoff is great  really the main tie in from iPhone to Mac   But there are some partial equivalents in the PC world  if you're willing to do a little work for them   For me 90  of that feature is texting on my Mac and the other 10  is making phone calls on my mac  the rest of the "app turnover" stuff isn't that critical   But is it worth sticking with a deteriorating product line  versus getting a shiny high tech PC for half the price  just for texting and phone calls on my computer     The irony is that at this point the Mac has lagged so far behind in innovation for so long that its most compelling feature for some users is just "plays nice with iPhone "  Is that going to be enough   Maybe for consumers with just more money than they know what to do with   Not so much for people whose computers are tools used to make money   It only makes sense to spend more on a computer if it helps me make more money or make it faster or with less effort   Mac OS did that for me  but Windows 10 has caught up on most of the core productivity features   Spotlight  Expose  window management in general  etc   And it's caught up on stability   If I'm really honest with myself  I have to admit that the only real advantage the new Mac has over a comparable PC is compatibility with my other Apple stuff

 In virtually every other MP game in existence  you can tell right away  who's very good at the game  through raw skill  map spawn knowledge  etc   other than people who just suck or can't hit shit  I honestly couldn't tell average from very good players in OW apart  It's odd   I think that's partially due to the matchmaking   IMO  a healthy multiplayer game needs to have servers areas where new players and experienced players can play together  That way  new players can see how high the bar is and get tips to improve  And experienced players can see just how far they've come

  And you're only hitting 80  damage reduction with a substantial power strength investment  which means you're taking a big hit to efficiency range duration  This goes back to my original comment which is that you just can't really build Equinox to effectively do more than one  sometimes two  things at once    This is my current all around build  http   images akamai steamusercontent com ugc 495776797351718990 03DD94D64D42E92671B1121874179573C93F14C5    Max efficiency  really good range and strength  and slightly less duration  And people say you lose too much when building her for anything less than just max range maim  This build can reach 71  extra strength on peaceful prov  day  and 80  DR  slow  night   If I want to stay in night it's possible  if I want to switch so I can perform the combo it's also possible     Naramon Focus working out    However  you'll only be stabbing something once  It then falls into the same category of "unreliability"

I remember when I first saw ads before a movie  and I thought we should have walked out and refused to watch them  But there was no Internet then and no way to organize a consumer revolt  Now we have the ability to just make the actual start times of a movie publicly known  There are sites you can check to find out if there are scenes after the credits  Why not also post how long the ads take  so people can show up when they want to  and soon the theatre will get the message  They can show a few ads to a full theatre or 20 minutes of ads to an empty one

I was relying on the sensors never being occluded  IE  when the first sync flash occurs we know that it will be a horizontal sweep  Then we just keep track of things after that  Not a big deal when you are only using one base station  It makes occlusion catastrophic though  But this is awesome  Makes a lot of sense too  I can't wait to implement it    I haven't done anything with the accelerometer in the phone yet  I'm hoping that there is some magic there that will fix my weird axis flipping problem though  I guess I'm a little confused at what he means by rotational ambiguity  My system can rotate just fine  when it's running on the phone   I'm pretty sure that is just handled by unity and the phones accelerometer      EDIT  Also  I've been assuming this whole time that we can determine a pose using 3 sensors and the accelerometer  My next step was going to be adding more sensors to the top  bottom and sides of the headsets  This is to help with occlusion  Each plane  top  bottom  front and sides  was going to have 3 sensors a piece  Is there anything wrong with my thinking here  This should work just fine right

I would advise to protest every year no matter what  I have worked in residential property tax in Texas before   protesting clients assessed values   For 2017  you have until May 31st  There are certain limited situations where you can protest late  I would advise you to contact a professional in this space  I no longer practice  to evaluate your specific facts  In Texas they are called "property tax consultants " Please Google first though  certain firms you want to stay away from    What is your market value in HCADS site  A link to the assessment card would be helpful    How does this compare to the purchase price  Note that it is difficult to overcome purchase price often times  Equitable appraisal can be an option    Make sure you file homestead and any other eligible exemptions

This is a great thought  but in my mind  those 3 died protecting Noctis for the final battle  The amount of daemons  and the fact you don't see them after he claims the throne except in the afterlife is a key that they are dead

YES NOT A WORLD OF REMNANT  Qrow's alive  D  DAMMIT I THOUGHT THIS WASN'T A WORLD OF REMNANT  I like Blake's dad  He's like Iroh  Also I find it funny when giants are pissed off at people because I like imagining them mentally shitting their pants  Holy shit  How did someone call Qrow's semblance  That seemed really out of the blue  or easily explained by other things  Shit  Qrow's dead  I wanted to see him fight some more  His style is the coolest in the whole series imo  Unless maybe Raven can do something  I'm really hoping that shot of the raven is a setup to make her entrance less deus ex machina
Second actually  
People way overreacting to that MCW pass  It was a nice reaction aye but it was clearly a hopeful chuck rather than an explicit  insane vision move  Get we don't like Rondo but he could would do the same thing 
Get a grip on your anger  Keep your mouth shut when you are angry  and talk when you have calmed down  Beg her forgiveness  promise to be better and more understanding  and mean it  Be accepting when she disappoints you  Ask her to not make promises unless she can follow through on them  Good luck  mate 
How do you like the Sig scope  I'll be sticking one on my next build   admittedly mostly for the looks but I like trying new things and the glass isn't all too important on this rifle

I'll run counter to most people here in saying that I find 3D pretty enjoyable  Most recently  Doctor Strange was fantastic in 3D  In worse films the effects don't accomplish a ton  but I go to the cinema infrequently enough that my 3D viewing experience has been quite positive

You should download it anyway and bind it to your account  It's a free game 
I can kinda see why you'd like it better  it's more complex than A 10  But I'm not too happy with it so far  There is only one mode level and It's not as good as A 10's attach mode  It takes so long to kill things it's very annoying

Depends on the fight  Use both on pull then EM on CD then Asc if needed or save it for next EM   pot  It's a bit awkward but it comes more down to the fight than anything else

Men grunting when lifting weights at the gym amazes me  but in a bad way  I think it's super gross and makes me scared to work out in the same area  Sometimes it feels like they purposefully grunt louder when a woman joins the area  It sounds almost sexual sometimes   Why are men  stereotypically  so silent in bed  but so fucking loud at the gym

I think a lot of these people are coming from PC  which on there what they say might be true  But I'm on console and I can kind of back up what he says  I've been playing TF2 since release and 7 or 8 times out of 10  most if not all of the players on both teams are using the R201  Lol I've heard of the CAR and the Volt but I'll be damned if I've ever seen someone use it  I used to main Devotion btw and I have been out ranged handedly by the R201 on multiple occassions  Let's just look at the accuracy for example  Hemlok Acc is 80  Flatline Acc is 45  G2 has 85  and our boy R201 has 90 Acc  the highest of all the assault rifles  even more so than the Burst fire and Semi Auto rifles  That doesn't seem to make a lot of sense  The R201 doesn't have a bad stat  It's got amazing accuracy  above average range  and damage  high rate of fire  and a clip that's more than big enough in conjuction with its other stats  Coming from someone with a background in competitive tcg  usually the EASIEST way to tell when a particular card is "OP" is when it makes up over half the average team comp  time and time again  Just saying

Obviously I'm biased  but I think we normally have a pretty exciting team   Outstanding defense that has scored 11 times  maybe 12     That's exciting     Offense led by a dual threat QB that has put up 30 or more in 12 of 14 games   Scoring points in different ways is exciting

But what is an Andre track at this point  For a long time now he hasnt stuck to one sound and has been on everything from boom bap to experimental instrumentals  And the fact we know he's capable of shining on anything means his next project could literally sound like anything  He could a full futuristic sounding album in which Travis would be a good fit  If he goes traditional ATLiens  which i higly doubt  then I take your point  But 3k isn't one to stick to any particular sound  especially not rehash it

  Its just pyro acting weird against teleporting units  in the right moment   Technically it's the Blink acting weird since it effectively removes your Hero from the field for a frame or two and then causes him her it to appear at the target location  However  Pyro tracks the location of the Hero rather than the Hero itself   if it tracked the Hero itself  if Zera blinked  Pyro would lose its target and probably just disappear  since he wouldn't exist for 1 2 frames because of the way Blink works   and in that frame where your Hero is not existent anymore due to the Blink  Pyroblast has it's explosion location set at the place where the Hero Blinked from since it couldn't find any other more recent location   Hope I explained that as well as possible

That's different and you are remembering incorrectly  My beef was with Joshua Ho the anandtech author who has had a long time history of being anti Samsung and AMOLED  Not until recently did he finally admit that AMOLED is finally superior to LCD   I contacted the Anandtech Chief Editors about his anti Samsung bias  Unlike most of their reviews that objectively review a phone  the S7 review was filled with personal bias and opinion  They are aware of it and had other people contact them about it  but ultimately they are allowed it because they are moving away from strictly  objective reviews and making their reviews more subjective    http   www anandtech com home about   This is one reason why I no longer hold Anandtech to such a high regard

Those things can go to hell  My first experience with a coeurl in this game was right after one of the early royal tombs  you come out and there is a coeurl around you can fight or not  I wasted nearly all my potions and phoenix downs without killing it  Fast forward to a month later  and I get to fight them again in menace under costlemark  I'm level 99  safety bit  prevents instand death on everyone  and I'm using as much strengthening accessories and weapons as I can and they still slaughtered me twice  What I did to beat them was use zwill crossblades  warp strike to start the battle  then go right into armiger which I'd stored up  then just before it ends  armiger chain  That took out one of them  just barely  First two times it failed to kill one  and they just ran to the walls and healed themselves all the way back up  The second one  I just warp striked with all my mp and hit with daggers as fast as I could  when I got the tech bar up to two  I'd switch to bow of the clever  and use overwhelm   I doubt anyone will read this old thread  but if anyone comes here looking for a way to kill them  you have to take out one of the two elder coeurls in seconds or its all over  You can fight one if you're careful and have safety bit

What has your winrate been so far on your Smurf in hero league    I may have missed it  hard to go back and check while writing this in the Reddit ap
but did you mention what rank you are on your main account   I climbed from Silver 1 to Diamond 3 in season 1  I definitely agree with your comments  and I think the best part of hitting Platinum was people doing the camps shenanigans much less        There are still those players that are bad and feel like they don't belong in the higher ranks and it sticks out a lot more  Exploiting them when they were on the enemy or trying doubly hard to shore their weaknesses up when they were on my team helped a lot in the latter stages of climbing   What are your thoughts on MMR Hell then  My observation is that it is very real when you're slightly better than your team  i e  you should be in mid gold rather than mid silver   as you don't really get challenged enough to improve much just by playing HL and the skill difference isn't large enough for you to tip the scales  You usually have to look for improvement by other means  I watch a lot of streams and read guides    Tho  I think the real MMR Hell is the fact that even with a consistent 55  winrate  which I think pretty strongly indicates you should be higher ranked   it takes  hundreds  of games to climb a full league  Personal adjustments help  but if something clicks for you and you do improve a lot in a relatively short amount of time  which I think does happen   your rank reflects those changes  much  slower

Oh sorry I didn't realize you'd been taking it for that long  You're most likely correct then in assuming it wasn't based on tolerance and while waiting a week would certainly answer the question I wouldn't want you to risk seizures for the sake of testing it from the serious withdrawals

So Roger sends the btc to the tumbler and then roger reveals the solution to the puzzle so that gregory can take the btc that is now in the tumbler   What I dont understand is how the link is severed between the 3 because 1 btc went to the tumbler from roger  and then gregory takes that btc   Does this require a high amount of participants to obfuscate  I thought that this was a 2 party solution  where 2 people could exchange value without any linkage between them without other actors in the mixing

  current  by the time the aura hit  enemy health and shields upon kill   You can only get damage if they have health silly  Say you have a 1k hp target  and you use maim  You'll get 75   not 80 my bad  but it's close enough  or 750 damage  If he's half that then you'll get 375    1st test  level 20 arid h gunner  full health  maim bleed kill   711    2nd  same gunner   half health  maim bleed kill   386    3rd  same gunner  full health  raged  zhuge headshot kill   711  Isn't that um  75  of their health  or the max damage you can deal to them    It is  half health  so not exactly perfect

I remember having to do the classic 50 gooser challenge  Fun times  
Interesting  I've farmed it since the patch and only targeted the head  and I know I've gotten both drops  What I don't know is if I actually broke the beak  will have to try that out next time  Thanks 
Yeah  It pains me having to stop the game because it played so tedious  Had a bunch of really cool and nice concepts binding the stories together  but to the gameplay kinda fell apart   
  covering the important ones   I think it's entirely reasonable to limit the scope  but that does mean you agree that "every single aspect of every single card every single interaction" was a bit optimistic  It also means that there will certainly be some cases which are not covered by the tests  so the problem will not be eliminated  merely reduced      given that most cards really don't interact  hundred thousand  again  these should have taken a minute to write each  maybe 2  which is 20 weeks of time  I suspect that just the act of doing a code review would take longer than 2 minutes per test  but ok  2 minutes   100 000   3333 3 hours  Assuming 40 hour work weeks that's 83 3 weeks  not 20  So it would take 2 full time developers working on this and only this to finish the task in a year  in which time 3 or possibly 4 new sets will have been released which will also need tests written  Keep in mind that the number of interactions that need to be covered with each new set is going to grow over time  since the existing card pool with which to interact keeps growing         EDIT  In short  Doable  Sure  but it's not trivial  If they're approaching this perfectly rationally  they would do a cost benefit analysis and find the tradeoff point at which the development overhead is counterbalanced by the customer experience  I expect the tradeoff point that they've reached is more of a guess than a rigorous calculation  but nevertheless there will have to be such a tradeoff point  and some interactions will have to go untested 
No correlation from what I've seen

I haven't reset stats obviously   just been playing for a long time  Have an original gremy etc    Anyway  you're right  you won't kill a BB in 3 salvos  But it's also super luck dependent for them to kill you in 2  Remember you can take like 4 citadels without dying and it's almost rng whether they actually hit you with proper positioning  Also their reload means it takes at least 30secs to 2 minutes  More than enough time to reposition IF you know where the DDs are and that they can't spot your unsafe turning    So the point is not to actually kill DDs  but know where they are so that you avoid getting lit up while getting into a position  whether it be using islands or getting on the opposite side of where guns are aimed  Cruiser stealth is 10 12km  so you can definitely move effectively  The amount of map awareness you need a in CA to be effective is very high and I'd welcome any change that helps you with that  Obviously I see and accept the problems with the RPF  but I'm unwilling to judge it fully as just a BB buff just yet  But I see your point

I personally hate the aram mode  but I'm pretty sure OP didn't mean he wanted aram in the normal map rotation  which would only make sense in QM anyway   but rather as a game mode you queue up for specifically  which shouldn't bother anyone who doesn't care for aram   On second thought  if you meant on the brawl rotation  the only argument for removing it would be to add the aram mode separately because it's the only time people who like aram can play it  actual aram instead of autoselect

Late second trimester and third trimester abortions are  expensive   Thousands to over ten thousand dollars  often not covered by insurance  There are  very few doctors in the US who perform these procedures    http   www bbc com news magazine 21207787  and some of them operate in states with narrow limitations on who can and cannot get an abortion beyond a certain number of weeks  restricted to life health of the mother or severe fetal defect   All of them carefully screen which patients they provide abortions for  and regularly turn people down    There is simply no epidemic of "late term" abortions  and the idea that women will wait until they're 26 weeks  travel across state lines  spend  10 000 or more  with a doctor who will give them an abortion for no particular reason at all is just a completely made up straw man used by those against abortion to score easy points in the abortion debate      This is what happens when you let politicians make medical decisions for women      http   abcnews go com Health 20 week abortion ban nebraska oklahoma fetus feel story id 13116214  It is disgusting and it happens here in the US   The reasons you see late second and third trimester abortions are generally circumstances like maternal health  rape survivors who were in deep denial  and a lot of people who discover that their very much wanted pregnancy has something terribly wrong with the fetus and who decide that abortion is the best decision they can make under the circumstances    We should believe that these people's tragic  heartbreaking circumstances are real and valid  We should support people's right to abortion  especially  in terrible circumstances  Most importantly  we should trust that patients and doctors are capable of making the best decision for that patient and that sweeping laws  do not benefit anyone involved    If you want some perspective on the issue  watch the documentary After Tiller  The doctors that perform late second and third trimester abortions in the US face hell  regular death threats  arson  vandalism  governmental witch hunts  harassment and stalking  and sometimes actual murder  to try to do what they believe is right  providing necessary  essential healthcare for women in spite of all dangers to themselves

Don't compare Kodak to Tyga  Clearly you've not listened to Kodaks music very much if you truly think he's below Tyga  And maybe you could argue the other two aren't on Tyga's level lyrically   but Uzi and Yachty have both released much better songs than Tyga's ever released

Everyone is humouring my grandmother because her first husband was abusive as hell  So now we all tiptoe around her  as she refuses to educate herself on anything  including illnesses in the family  judges everything she doesn't understand  which is pretty much anything under 50 years old   discourages everything even vaguely adventurous  complains constantly and gives really unhelpful advice because she doesn't understand the problem and doesn't want to  This year she sat me down and told me I should not go to the group of specialists who have finally accepted me into their program for my particular illness and instead go to a hospital near her that doesn't even deal with the type of disease   because all my doctors are clearly incompetent  Not curing an incurable disease within three years is completely unacceptable  don't you know  My grandfather used to shout and hit her for it  which is obviously horrible  but just quietly mumbling that she isn't the brightest but means well isn't a solution either  Plus it means her grandchildren don't really want to spend time with her  which would break her heart if she knew    Also they all worship children  including incredibly ill behaved ones and then get furious when those children become ill behaved teenagers  who they promptly try to pretend don't exist  leading to all sorts of issues

Even looking through the live action movies list there  there are not that many examples  like  a microscopically  infinitesimalily tiny number compared to all the movies out there  and about half of that tiny list of examples are dubious marginal examples at best   Racking my brain through every single movie and TV show I've watched in the last ten years put together  I can come up with exactly  one  villain character explicitly stated to be gay  Hartley Rathaway aka Pied Piper who appeared in 3 episodes of the TV show The Flash   Complaining about always having to deal with gay villains in movies is utterly absurd  it'd be like complaining about not being able to get away from movies with pole vaulting scenes  or movies featuring giraffes  You could watch two movies you've never seen before every day for a year and encounter this trope maybe once  if that

If you want to spend a dumb amount of money converting a FWD only econobox for no good reason  at least start with a platform that  has  an AWD option  I e  the CR V has an AWD ready transaxle that may fit a Civic  and the RAV4 Highlander Transaxle would probably also fit a Camry  And then you would have to grind and hammer away a whole swath of the undercarriage to fit the driveshaft and then somehow bolt the whole rear subframe of the CR V RAV4 into the Civic Camry and probably transplant the ECU and potentially a shitton of wiring   Sell it 
Very funny and original   EDIT  why are people that dumb not to see that setting nonsense iOS version for the iDevice that can't even run it so they downvote my sarcasmic comment 
Screeps can be pretty fun  "playing" it atm  same username   I'm not really active at the moment  but I still check up on it  If you join the slack channel you can get a lot of support for it  as there are a lot of helpful people online there  It is paid  but if you buy it on steam you get 10CPU after the initial period expires  That is enough for 1 possibly more rooms  so you could try that out  I don't know how it compares to the other games mentioned here though  
Yea    it is what it is  P

Also  165 wont make you huge   Im 165 right now and Im not huge   Itll effect your bodyweight lifts  i e  Pullups  Dips  but if you work on them as you gain  you'll be fine   Assuming those are important to your goals and overall workout  
What is it about me that everyone assumes I can't shoot a gun or use power tools correctly             
Ah  so that's what people mean when they say MGS5 has a bad story compared to the others  The only MGS i played was MGS4 and that was more like multiple movies with some tiny gameplay breaks in certain parts    Some of the 40  minute cutscenes had me considering making some popcorn to eat while i waited 
The usual translation is something along the lines of "It's by doing anything that you can become anybody"   But I'd say that it's more like "It's by being random that you become random"  
I'll have to check it out   Shame there's no demo   I can't imagine being more impressed than I am with Nightstar  but if I get a chance to try it without making a full purchase I definitely will     Having special weapons seems like it could be cool    Do you need both motion controllers to play   That's a major bonus about Nightstar for me atm since I'm limited to a single motion controller right now

I am fair with pink undertones and I use the Revlon Colorstay foundation in 130 Porcelain  It has a slight pink to it but it's more so neutral  It doesn't turn yellow on my skin like most do  I'd also recommend Too Faced Born This Way foundation in snow or pearl   L'Oréal also has foundations in drugstores separated by the undertone  I haven't tried them but I've heard the Infalliable Pro Matte is really good

So because you don't find it fun and don't think it has any reason to exist it should be removed  By your logic I could have arena removed just because I don't like it  I do like it   Or I could have joust ranked joust removed  What makes your request more valid than mine  If you just remove modes that people play and enjoy because you personally don't like them then you really are just trying to kill the game by making it less diverse and alienating players making lots of them quit the game  Less players   less money and that's not good

You can kill a hunter with a gas grenade and pistol headshots  if you are really hard up for gear  Although anything that stuns them for a second like a shock grenade works too  They die in less than a mag to the head from the starting M9 if you get almost all headshots  The problem is they heal  which is why you CC them first   I think I've had one gold piece a few times extracting  majority of the time its a mix of purple and blue armor with a blue or purple M44  gold if I can get one  Not really needed  though

Your explanation is so vague almost every trick in rocket league could be considered a dribble   Also  this definition of a dribble I found on the Internetz suits my pov  " is the art of keeping the ball close to you at all times so that you are able to quickly manouver it around opponents and pass it off or score an easy goal  Same goes in Rocket League"   Also  if it's not near your car  it doesn't make any sense to call it dribbling  In my country  hitting the ball past a rival and getting it again is called autopass

It pretty much works like this  If an enemy has a chance to drop something  like say  the sturdy helix horn from breaking leucorns horn  increases to drop chance will assist you in getting an item from them  But for something that's guaranteed to drop an item  but has multiple drops it can choose from a set pool  then you cannot increase the drop rate because it's already at 100   If there was an item that increased rare drop rates that might have been useful  but alas we just have to rely on the 5  chance of getting the V2

The camera on the mustang had a very wide angle lens   I think it might actually show you 180 degrees side to side   The one on the car that almost got you might have been an early one  or a cheap DIY job   And because it's on the back of the car  it acts like a periscope allowing you to see beyond the line of cars where you are still sitting between parked cars and can't see anything

There are good ways and bad ways to do RNGs  and I think there is not only too many of them in this game but they also haven't been implemented very well   This just leads overall to player frustration  which doesn't help keep a game popular     The problem with the implementation is that it mainly challenges players arbitrarily and doesn't get better with any individual player's skill   You can learn how to curve a thrown ball  but getting increasingly better at curving doesn't actually equate to more caught pokemon   This is because pokemon CP gets consistently higher  and therefore harder to catch  up to a point  which will often negate curving skills     In a sense this was fixed by completing the medals for each pokemon type  but I don't know if doing this really increased player satisfaction appropriately   But that's probably only my opinion at halfway through level 32

Razer Hydra controllers  and an oculus Rift DK2 are the closest you can really get to a poor man's Vive  I've tried the trinus app with cardboard it's not going to work with games that need you to do anything more then look around  Those controlers would only work with games that accept gamepads since steam isn't going to recognize them as inputs from Vive controllers adding leap motion won't make them motion controllers  Leap just tracks your hands  The Leap motion can be used to emulate Vive inputs based on just your hands  those controllers wouldn't do anything  but it barley works in most games    You can however get a DK2 and Razer Hydra controllers for anywhere from  300 400  You can decently play some Vive games that way and all non touch Oculus games

Charlotte has better tanking abilities and can protect the party better but only has 5  stats  still very good though   Snow benefits from higher stats that come from a 6  unit but has less ability to reduce damage to other party members  He's got extremely good countering abilities which help a lot in arena though   Charlotte also has that unique story quest which will give her the Patriot Shield which gives her access to an AoE status ailment cleansing ability  like Cloud of Darkness's Comeback ability  when equipped   I'd personally go for Charlotte even though she is only 5  max because with a couple pots and good gearing she can reach DEF 300  and HP 4K

I know what you mean  I went to see Star Wars on Tuesday and it was about 20mins of commercials   'Started' at 7 35  finally got to the start of the freaking movie at 7 55  I thought the 10mins of crap at the start was bad enough but apparently Cineplex didn't think so   PS  I also hate the forced 3D crap  I just want to see the movie normally without any of this 3D crap that adds nothing to the movie  except to make it dark AF   They had 1 non 3d showing for the entire day and at least 8 3D showings  probably more  that day

And this is how you open what I like to call 'the third eye'  seeing potential crazy shots before they happen  from really weird positions such as the wall   There aren't a lot of people who know how to use the wall   if they do  they're almost automatically in the purple ranks  It takes serious experience and vision to be able to pull this off consistently in a match    Nice shot

If you go against a team of non aa assassins he's actually quite a good solo tank  He has similar peel to the leading contendors and has better mobility than most of them as well  His issue comes down to the fact that he is just as easy to take down as an assassin by AA heroes  and with Raynor in the meta again he's rarely viable    I think he'll be tweaked again a bit  but if you draft him as a double warrior in specific situations he's quite strong  I just would avoid using him as a solo warrior due to how easily he dies against certain heroes  but under the right circumstances he's exceptional  He's a good counterpick in the rare situations you go against Cho'Gall as well  as his heroic makes the situation a 3v5 which is almost always going to be in your favor   He's also quite strong against Li Ming  Jaina  Chromie and Kael  Li Ming is particularly weak against him since the beetles absorb her skill shots making her value in a team fight really limited  He's probably good against Gul'Dan as well but I haven't seen him as a counterpick to them  He can engage easily  isolate the hero and hopefully get follow up  Whether or not it's just better to get Kerrigan Tyrael for this role though is debatable

It's definitely doable Slower movement speed aka walking is easily added for vr users it does however it would  mean you would probably be at a disadvantage overall in fps scenarios but that would be a reasonable cost for being able to experience it in vr  I certainly wouldn't expect cig to 'dumb down' the game for non vr users as far as movement goes They would also have to disable transition animations such as entry of ships as they would be nausea inducing and also link character position and posture to headset position such as squatting crawling lying prone etc 
You can play guys out of position and still unlock the game  Your roster won't say you have the boost  but the solos will unlock anyway

Your concern is spot on from analyzing the method in question   On the other hand  if someone is playing a non parabolic curve  effectively  if they have lots of one drops and lots of 5 drops   then their issue is different in generalthey just don't know how to put together a reasonable deck  or they're specifically building some form of specialized ramp deck  Tron comes to mind with its Exploration map  Ancient Stirrings  and giant Eldrazi   So either they're not ready to use this tool because their deck needs to be improved  or they won't be using this tool anyway because their deck is a specialized ramp deck

Well they reached the point with me where I didn't even buy F4 and have absolutely no regrets about it  If someone had told me in 2008 that I wouldn't give a fuck about a new Fallout game in the future because it was made by Bethesda I would tell them that they're crazy  But I've lost interest in everything they do as a developer    To me they took a similar turn as Bioware  Used to care about them  then "put up" with some of their bullshit because I still enjoyed their games to some degree  then lost all interest in anything they do because their target audience seems to be people that don't care a lot about dialogue choices and quest design

I stated no such thing  I stated that a person who is young   a group of people who are typically perceived rightly or wrongly by the public at large to be immature   who wishes to be or appear to be more mature would benefit from an expanded vocabulary  No one is saying they have to  I personally don't care if they do or don't  it's their life to live  What I'm saying is that if they wish to achieve their goal  this is one of the factors that will increase their chance  They don't have to do it  they may succeed without it  but they will most likely benefit from it

Sorry it took me a bit to reply  busy season  I'm always up for book suggestions  I'll add those to the list  I get the impression I'd be preaching to the choir if I went to Klein and Chomsky so I'll go with examining the diaspora that I think most influences the rejection of the left    For a US perspective I was really kicked into being more empathetic by Deer Hunting With Jesus by Joe Bageant the UK side I find best represented in Chavs by Owen Jones    I absolutely agree that there are race and sex based injustices that need to be addressed  it's primarily how they are currently presented that I think causes problems  We need to be seeing others as allies to rise with rather than enemies to rise against  Call me a hopeless idealist but I honestly think most people are basically decent

IANAL  but it's fine as long as the person remains in their sight  with exception below   The arrest just has to be "on or in relation to" the property the person has care over  so a security guard can chase someone out of a store and arrest them on a public sidewalk for theft of store property  Or you can detain a pickpocket who nabbed your phone or wallet on the TTC  It's the exact same section of the Criminal Code that allows both of you to do this  even if not recommended    The biggest odds of liability arises when a security guard loses sight of a thief  if a thief tosses the items and is arrested with nothing on them  how exactly do the security guards prove to the real police that the person stole anything  They can't  Then the security guards are the ones getting cuffed for forcible confinement  assault  etc   Relatedly  it used to be that such an arrest had to occur immediately  However  the Lucky Moose case relaxed that a bit  Now the arrest can occur within a reasonable amount of time  e g   if a thief returns to your store a while later  But presumably you'd have to have airtight proof that the theft occurred in the first place  e g   video of the thief clearly walking out the store with the property

It's hard to get a clear look at it  but my best guess is that it's a 2009 2013 Toyota Corolla  It looks a bit smaller than a Camry to me and the C pillar at  19 sec in the second video looks to be more like the Corolla's  It's not as angled   Either way  both of those cars have the third brake light mounted in the bottom of the rear window in pretty much all trim levels except for the S trim   Hope that helps  I'm guessing they didn't leave any paint or  car  body parts behind when they smashed your mailbox

Okay see the thing is female UFC fights just became a thing recently  MMA started in the 80's but UFC wasnt developed until 1993 around the time of the Gracie BJJ dominance  And even though the first female MMA fight in was in 1997  it wasnt until 2009 Strikeforce televised the first female fight  The first female fighter  Rousey  wasnt signed to UFC until 2012   The reason this is important is because there is essentially an entire generation  almost 20 years  between male MMA becoming mainstream and female MMA becoming mainstream  There is now fiscal security in this career  However  males have had 16  years longer to foster a market and develop competition  There are men who have spent nearly their whole lives training for mma  just like other sports such as basketball  football  boxing  etc   However  female fighters have only had this as a viable career path for a few years  This means fewer female fighters were seeking this career as well as those that do were less likely to be able to train as a full time job

It works  For now    But it's severely underfunded  The times have changed  When social security was enacted in 1935 the average life expectancy was 62  Today the average life expectancy is 79  Source  http   www infoplease com ipa A0005148 html    But the age to reap benefits has only gone up 1 year despite the 17 year increase in life expectancy  It has gone from a program that was intended to support people unable to work in the last stages of life to a program supporting retirees  It may seem like a subtle difference but it's an important one  Hell  More than half the people didn't live long enough to receive it when it was enacted  Now all we're looking at is budget shortfalls in the near future because 1  the age is too low  2  we aren't collecting enough taxes to fund it  Changing either of those is unpopular  hence the downvotes  so congress won't do it  And completely revamping the system is a total no go because it get's people's panties in a wad  So we're left with a broken  underfunded system that's going to fuck over most people under the age of 40  
The best quick tip I can give is  this gun is fully automatic  Hold the trigger down like you're using a SMG  Firing it semi automatic is handicapping yourself

I use a rolling volley  sequential fire  if I'm unsure how fast a target is moving  so I move my mouse ahead as I roll the volley along  to test his speed  I then observe how the shells fall   After seeing the results from that  I can estimate the area I need to saturate   so then I deliver full broadsides to that area if the enemy ship continues moving in that direction   Rolling vollies  especially when you have very fast reloading guns  like the Minotaur  Atlanta or Gearing  can also be demoralizing for the enemy ship  and cause him to behave rashly  He realizes he's being cooked by seemingly unstoppable he  so he might come charging right at you   and then you can unload your torps in his face

So basically what's already happening in the UK in terms of pension ages etc 
Islands aren't dangerous as long as you're not completely on your own and have other ships with you to focus destroyers when they get greedy  and eventually they will    The benefits from islands is that it makes it much easier to get close  which is a big deal for a lot of battleships  I have the best results doing that in my new mexico or my colorado  If I get near the center  first  I'll be on my own  then  i'll be the primary target and will likely die  Angling does wonders but there's so much you can take before your ship gets sunk eventually  Islands let you pick your fights and then you don't have to tank the entire enemy fleet in a heroic but pointless charge  but they do require planning not to get ambushed 
Thanks

In the end  you made a great choice      Value wise  I think the VP9 is bloody hard to beat  I don't dislike Glocks at all  but shooting the VP9 and a friend's G19 was like driving a BMW vs a Camry  And since the HK is less than 100 dollars more    easy choice imo

Regardless of legality  I feel like you did the equivalent of sticking your fingers in your ears and saying "la la la  I can't hear you"   She obviously mentioned the rent increase to you in some capacity  It may not have been it writing  it should have been   but  even if we believe everything happened the way you said it did  to say she told you about the increase the day of is disingenuous   In any event   in California  http   www dca ca gov publications legal guides lt 2 shtml   she is required to give you 30 days' written notice of a rent increase if you're on a month to month tenancy  Some cities may have restrictions on how much the rent may be increased  Now  whether  25 is worth jeopardizing your relationship with the master tenant and potentially losing the place is up to you   I don't know if you're in a city that requires just cause for eviction  Even still  because you're not paying the landlord directly  those just cause protections probably don't even apply to you    Personally  I would just pay it and move on  But your choice

I'm sorry  I'm too lazy but I stand with you and encourage others to participate in help achieve your goal   Me too thanks

Miesha definitely hasn't improved  and even if she has  she got wrecked by Ronda twice and she's now retired  Zingano doesn't look to have improved that much either  but there's a better case for her  As for Cyborg  I do think she'd destroy her  but as I mentioned  she's been busted for steroids twice  so I don't really count her  Did you read my post

Well  today has been   something  Yesterday I wasted all my non paid quartz  so I had nothing to roll except the paid gacha  Woke up today  and saw my fears of non announced limited gacha came true   So  I rushed and rolled the paid gacha first   and got Waver  just who I wanted   Then I panicked and went to the store to buy all the tickets available and rolled them in the hopes of getting anything from the limited gacha  On the sixth ticket   in came Musashi  Just to put in perspective  this was right after I woke up  I still had no idea who the new Servant was  As soon as I got her  I stopped   And much later today  I got the desire to get the new Kimono Artoria CE  So I rolled my remaining tickets  and the 18 quartz from today's login  Not only did I get the CE   I also managed to get Musashi to NP2   I guess this is a good start to the new year

Exercise at the moment  I was in such a bad shape last year I needed to find something to do   Took up running and found out just how lovely it was    The running motivated me to really do something about my weight and since last may I've dropped  20kg   I'm planning on running in the Reykjavik marathon in the end of august  Just 10km to begin with I think  The one above that would be a half marathon  but I don't know what I'll be able to do

OK I have to draw the line here   If you lose GL3 when you could have avoided it  it is quite the DPS loss for any MNK  It is as lazy as saying that MNK can skimp on going to position for Dragon Kick and Twin Snakes because the damage from those 'isn't much'   Meanwhile DRG has to active its short CD ONCE and if you're just off CD and lost BOTD that's the fault of the player as much as the fault of the MNK for losing GL3

The meta is still very new but here's a decklist https   shadowverse gamepress gg deck control bloodcraft Expect things to change as the dust settles    Shadow Control actually seems viable due to introduction of the new cards  I don't play shadow myself so can't help you much other than that 
Keep an eye on shop for some 5   6  runes  every now and then you'll run across a decent rune to stick on your monsters   Rune requirements for Giants isn't as intense as you think  There are people who get away with 85  success and still have an odd 4  rune here and there   of course at that point you gradually replace the weaker runes with better ones  
Once again  never done M  but i can say ive felt the exact feeling that you are with other stimulant comedowns  particularly Dexmethylphenidate  Focalin   You definitely shouldnt redose after 2 days  Most people recommend like 2 months minimum  It wont be lethal or anything but whatever youre feeling right now should be way worse next time  Get some sleep and re evaluate  Sleep is key  If you decide to  then youll be fine  just feel awful for around a week probably  I think you should keep the 40 and wait to roll again until you have more and more time has passed  40 shouldnt do much if anything at all imo

Again  not that easy   For one thing  the Rays signed a contract on the Trop in St Pete's   Hard to just up and walk away   And then you'd run into the same problems as with expansion  you'd need owners willing to operate out of Portland vs Tampa Bay  you'd need to build a stadium  you'd need to figure out the travel schedule  you'd need to figure out things that don't mean much to us but mean everything to the actual cities   Moreover  shifting divisions and leagues is not that easy or common   You can look at the history of it for yourself   It happens fairly rarely  primarily only when there's an expansion or relocation  which again is difficult to do and takes a lot of time   You're trying to just shift around multiple teams  including switching the Brewers to the AL  just so that the Astros can move  back  to the NL  without considering the logistics of it or if the Astros  or their fans  even  want  to go back the NL Central   From what I've seen  many Astros fans are perfectly happy being in the AL with a DH   And that's still beside the point  relocation  expansion  and division shifting requires years of planning to figure everything out   It has to really be worth it to happen   Doing on a whim so that the Astros can be back "where they belong" is simply never going to happen

Totally agree about the Oils maps  more specifically the first map  last sector   It's so setup for a defensive victory   I don't think I could setup a more perfectly defensible region   Limited  narrow entry points into the castle  no flanking opportunities  save one  very narrow tunnel from a bunker but only if you have one of the points already   all entry points are covered by multiple high ground perches  AA  multiple planes  and spots that are not counter mortarable   You really cannot win this sector without a behemoth unless the defenders are bad or your attacking team is extraordinarily good     Oh  and lets not forget that the default spawn likes to drop you on the North side of the map  in the open  and needing to cross a river before you can get to decent cover

I didn't actually make that connection  but yeah  there are a lot of similarities   I don't necessarily want to start everything from scratch  Through lore  everyone would know what happened and where they came from  though as time goes on  fewer and fewer would believe it   The thousand or so from each race were able to bring whatever they could carry with them  so there's possibly some magical texts and even a few magical items that might exist from the old world  Plus  the skills they knew from before the catastrophe would never be lost  though I'm considering having one or more of the races revert back to barbarism

That's fine and all  but there's not all that much  besides armor layout and basic gunnery  that's historically accurate about this game  Besides  a videogame should be fun  but it doesn't have to be realistic  Same thing with detonations  it's not about whether it happened IRL  it's about it not being a fun mechanic

If you want any say from Jagex about AHK  they will tell you that if you do use AHK and you somehow get flagged for botting by their bot detection system  they will not help you out   1 1 is generally considered "safe"  I'm guessing because it doesn't get detected  there may be other reasons   This means 1 key does 1 action  so in your case  it's considered "safe"   If Jagex said anything more about what they will consider "safe" about AHK  people will abuse it and go to the limits

The three is really hated because it's a 2 that's been "lawyered"  There's a ton of annoying and useless safeties  which is just something gun people hate  It's got a loaded chamber indicator  mag disconnect  and a keyhole that can lock the gun  Just look at the Hillary lock Smith and Wesson revolvers  The gun shoots exactly the same  and takes down the same as the 2 so you might as well get that  For 300 you might be able to find a decent 2 somewhere  The 4 costs around 400 right now most places I've seen it  Edit  I should add  that if you're fine with the "features" of the 3  you can definitely find one within your budget

Actually  Age of Empires II  https   en wikipedia org wiki Age of Empires II   1999 release  is 3 years older than  Morrowind  https   en wikipedia org wiki The Elder Scrolls III  Morrowind   2002 release   Perhaps you were thinking of  Daggerfall   https   en wikipedia org wiki The Elder Scrolls II  Daggerfall  Which was released in 1996   My vote for the test of time went to Age of Empires for still being relevant and fun after so many years  I really only considered Age and Team Fortress II for that category as the other games seemed fairly new for being judged as standing the test of time  Not to say that I don't enjoy them though  as here I am on this sub   Morrowind and the other elder scrolls games are still great fun too though and I wish Morrowind had been included instead of Skyrim

Thanks   Re github  it's probably a few things    first off  I am not a developer  Second  I only just switched to PC this year as well  so some of the directions I get that refer me to github are far from intuitive  For instance  when building the Atreus I was just sent to a directory  like I was supposed to know what to do from there  Fork this  clone that  load this code  it's all foreign to me  And understanding how to get a lump of code in a github link onto my keyboard was like the biggest mystery of the year for me  I really would like to learn though  and I don't mean to knock it  really it's just frustration at my own ignorance

You are saying people learned this from a commercial or they say it in a commercial  Sounds like they are just trying to advertise 
I am getting sick of all the selfish players who don't play this game properly  People don't throw ammo or medi packs   Medics would rather step on and crush your hand with their boots rather than rez you  I blame dice for this  If they made people only get points for playing their classes up to rank 5 in boot camp modes  then people would know how to play the game   I'm starting to stop reviving people as you go out your way to get to then and they respawn just as you get there  It's affecting how I play and enjoy the game  Your start to play like a selfish asshole otherwise you get really grumpy and annoyed during the game and calling these assholes all sorts of names during play

Its not a bad kit  but he already had his kit reworked  He used to be different  and the passive he had was similar to the one you have  Also i feel you should switch the basic attacks  make him normally do melee  but ranged with his ult  
It drops down to 60 70FPS on my system at 1080P  so it's meh framepacing should be better 
I think the important question is whether it's easier to grief by getting kills with a brimstone pad or is it easier to grief by killing yourself with someone else's brimstone pad  The answer to that question I think can inform us as to how bans and punishments should be handled in regards to killing with this device

 TF2 release  October 2007   almost 10 years   Skyrim release   November 2011   5 years  Okay    how about the rest in that category    Civ 5   September 2010   6 years   Terraria   May 2011   5 years   Age of Empires 2   September 1999   17 years  Some of these games  including Skyrim  haven't even had enough time to test it in the first place  Why are some of these even in this category  I mean I don't even    WHAT    Why not more of those beautiful 8 year or more veteran games  Fallout classic collection  Deus Ex  Rome Total War  Supreme Commander  Unreal Tournament  Jedi Knight just to name a few  How about your predecessor Oblivion    or Morrowind    I'm not even butthurt about TF2 losing as much as what we lost TO  C'mon  dig those old dogs up from our nostalgia and give them a day back in the limelight  They EARNED it 
Yeah  no  because they've done nothing to increase Porygon  Lapras  or Hitmonchan spawns either in the wild or via eggs   In fact you could say the increased baby chances in eggs has decreased the chance of getting these   I've had all the starters and their evolutions for ages  just had to go to nests to catch them and or buddy them   it wasn't hard    Things that you can't get in the wild and have to depend on eggs  though  like those three I mentioned are completely out of my hands   They don't spawn in nests so I can't go anywhere in particular to get them   And eggs are horrible sometimes   I've hatched at least 300  5km eggs at this point with no Porygon   I finally just got my first Aerodactly the other day so that knocked my remaining ones down from 4 to 3   That was my first "new" Pokemon in probably 2 months   that's how long I've been stuck without those last few

I think the biggest problem was focusing too much on the hive  Spread it out a bit   I also think maybe we should have started mid collapse  If it's a 10 year story    give us something to lose  Something to feel  Something to dread  Starting it now  we just come in and shit on everything and go straight to God killers  I don't feel like I earned any of it  And I feel like it cheapens the experience a bit  Maybe that's just me  But I just feel like we're God tier with nothing to challenge us  Nothing at risk "because we have the guardian"

Winds approaching mach 1 would be way beyond just hurling people through the air  The fastest tornado wind speed ever recorded was about 320 mph  or mach 0 41  Strong tornados will raze buildings to the ground  toss cars around  and occasionally strip pavement from roads  Winds more than twice that speed would be seriously bad news for anything on the ground and probably the ground itself

I like the concept for the Damage Control Designation  though there is the question of how likely people would sacrifice their R consumable to protect strangers as well as whether the R key would be unintentionally used to repair something minimal like a disabled turret  There is also the question of whether it could potentially be too powerful  for example  a division of 3 USN battleships stacking their R consumables for 60 seconds of invulnerability to damage over time  20 seconds per R usage  on top of the in between period where they are not being lit on fire or using the extraordinarily low cooldown on a destroyer's R consumable to keep the damage over time under control

A short period of marriage like yours usually means the spousal support will be very limited  in both amount and time  if it's granted at all   Your soon to be ex spouse would have to show he is entitled to spousal support first and then you go to the  spousal support guidelines  http   www justice gc ca eng rp pr fl lf spousal epoux spag toc tdm html  if he is  Jobs after the divorce don't matter at all   mainly looking at income during the marriage  I think new jobs during the separation period would be difficult to justify a spousal support order for too as the key is to look at income disparity during cohabitation   He has until two years after the divorce is finalised to come after you for spousal support under the  Family Law Act  in BC  It's a little tricky since divorces are also governed by Federal law as well and the  Divorce Act  doesn't set a limit  but undue delay is usually bar to examining spousal support   Best thing to do is still get a lawyer to help you work through the issues and make sure there's not an order in the first place  If not  I suggest you read through the following resources     https   www lawsociety bc ca docs becoming material Family pdf   http   www familylaw lss bc ca resources fact sheets spousal support php

the summoner is pretty strong  especially if its the unchained summoner  and can easily break the game  its init is a non issue cause it goes on your turn  but the edioloian sp   it scales quickly and you are basically a second hp bar to it  which makes it have insane hp while your safe in the back   on top of that you are also able to heal and do things while your pet is in the front line keeping up with other fighter types 
That is incorrect  If level 8s at arena 6 get less trophies for beating level 6s then it will be even harder for them to climb to the arena where they should actually be which will mean even more higher level players at lower arena   Also what do you think will happen if you climb to even higher arenas with your card levels You will face even more higher leveled players that would just stomp you

See  there you go again  You arrogantly dismiss my explanations as if it was fanfiction  By that token  I can say your interpretations and your criticisms are utter fantasy  lacking in any basis  driven solely by emotion  and stemming from a personal view of how the writing "should" be rather than an honest assessment of what the writing actually is   What's a ninja  A spy and an assassin  That's kinda the point  A spy also has information that she might need  especially if it turns out that Adam is nearby  She needs that information even if the spy is just a spy and not an assassin  And if you say  she should leave  that won't matter because Adam already knows where her parents are and who they are according to the twins  So he'd go after them anyway and hold them hostage anywhere even if she wasn't there  Because  again  fucking Adam Taurus  Everything she could possibly do would only make it worse because it's Adam fucking Taurus    Since you took the time to badmouth me  I'll badmouth you  Your criticisms aren't even criticisms  they're inaccurate  They're fantastical  They're hypocritical  They're fiction  They're inconsistent  They're an absolute trainwreck that a novice film student can point out because your words fail the eye test of what's actually happening on screen  Nothing is more ridiculous than an overzealous critic who thinks he's right when he's either repeatedly proven wrong or a critic who refuses to even consider the opposing view  I've considered your view  thought you may have had a point  but held it up to scrutiny  and realized it's not accurate 
I use the lozenges myself to get off the chaw  They do the trick for me    weening off process is verrry slow  though

i think we will see the relic's power by the end of the volume the same way we saw the maiden's powers in volume 3      what i do hope  however  is that we dont see more "magic powers" for a while and i do not mean semblances and stuff like jaune or ren's      i mean  adding yet another set of 4 powers even if we have yet to see A SECOND MAIDEN         also  love ruby's motivation "i want to help"         can we get a different line from her

Done   Thanks 
500 is not what most people would consider much hassle for small claims  Small claims is designed to be a low cost and low difficulty system to obtain a formal right to collect owed money as  an alternative to  expensive and hassle free superior court suits  They very different and  500 to  1000 is a very common range  It becomes less worthwhile when the fees and hassle are greater than possible recovery   200 when you need to buy  800 worth of airfare and hotels and cars for proper venue   if recovery despite a suit is unlikely   chronically broke and likely to stay that way  or when a personal relationship with the person owing you money is more important to you than the money    OP is against a gym with full resources and ability to pay  close enough that he can stop in and likely lives in the same jurisdiction  No lawyers are needed and the worst he would be out is a bit of time  you can recover actual costs  such as court filing and service costs  but not things like missing work to attend court or gas money to run around      The fees and costs rarely reach near a quarter of that and are often recovered as part of the judgement  It will involve writing a few letters and ultimately a few hours in courtx IF it even gets that far  In OP'S case  it's more likely it will get paid once the demand letter is sent   which is the first step     He has what seems to be good evidence  the debtor has the means to pay and I can't imagine how they might defend themselves against it   the bar isn't "beyond reasonable doubt" but more "who is more likely truthful " On this situation it's fairly clear to someone knowledgeable with small claims who would likely prevail     A judgement ultimately also disallows them from stalling repayment past the point of making it collectible as a judgement will give him a legal right to force their hand down the line instead of the gym claiming "sorry  too late to sue now"   and be correct     It scrapes my nerves when someone is encouraged to drop it as "not worth it" and discouraged to exercise a perfectly reasonable and possibly the only pracrically viable method they can recover money like in OP'S case  He's being jerked around  he gets a nice court system to pull his side of the rope for a song and elbow grease  I spend less and less of my time here just because of the waxes and wanes   school breaks  long weekends at holidays and so on  when far too much advice I'd guessed based on assumption and precious little knowledge and a lack of those experienced with the system as it truly is rather than often imagined

As a scout I currently average  45 kills per minute  Its does get boring at times  especially when your team is getting destroyed  but not terribly boring at that rate  My highest is playing as support at  76 kills per minute  with assault and medic falling between those two  The KPM's are climbing now that I kind of know what the hell is going on   And then every so often you find yourself in a spot where its like the enemy doesn't know you're there and you're just getting headshot after headshot  Those moments are what keep me sniping  And I always have one finger on the trigger and one on the spotter  
Because I want to feel like I'm worth something to someone  And touching my own dick gets boring after a while 
You've counted every minute he played for Arsenal  I'm talking between 2007 2011  It's ludicrous to count his minutes when he was 17   From a quick look  in his first 2 seasons with us  he averaged a goal assist about every 400 mins  In 09 10 he averaged a goal assist every 70 mins 
There are a rare few of us willing to speak out against the Jew  but as one myself the only message I can send to you is to lock your gate to all jews  even me if that is necessary  because I don't know a single other jew like me who hopes israel burns to the ground and wants europeans to have their own ethnostate  world jewry has infiltrated just about every country in the world  you must close your gates if you wish to be free

Thanks for all of the great tips  I really am thinking of doing a tournament on the Apocalyptic mode 
  you can't exactly tonkor lvl 200 enemies and expect them to die immediately  especially if they're heavies   You also can't expect lvl 200 enemies to even exist in this game  It takes like an hour in a survival to get enemies over level 100  getting them to level 200 would take way too long for it to be even remotely worthwhile

Six weeks is the healthy average  but you can have postpartum bleeding up to 3 months before its considered dysfunctional   My mother had a history of menorrhagia   so when her postpartum bleeding lasted 6 months it was of a no concern    Likewise because of the my family history   when I bled for 4 weeks after my miscarriage   it was completely fine    When I got Implanon NXT   I bled for 8 months non stop   my GYN encouraged me to persevere with it because it was helping prevent my PMDD  a form of psychosis that is hormonally triggered   ie  extreme PMS  but I was getting lots of skin problems from having to deal with constant bleeding    also turns out I don't have PMDD   I'm just completely hormone intolerant and because I was put on birth control at a young age for endometriosis   I'd never known a natural period until I got my coil in 2015    Then I got an IUCD   which is where they shove a metal rod in through your cervix into the womb   if your nulliparous like I was at the time   the hole is about 1 2mm and the T is a good 30mm     No pain medication   no anaesthetic   Just a long metal rod they shoved in first to measure your womb  then a plastic gun that shoots the coil into place   If you're lucky you'll go home 5 minutes later  nauseated and cramping like you're in first stage labour   If you're unlucky your body will go into cervical shock  and actually start trying to give birth to your new IUD  you'll go home 20 minutes later   because women don't need proper health care    I own a set   but I'm still so amazed at how much the female reproductive system can put up with

EAGLE CAD  There's a limited free version  but the reason mine takes so long to load is I have thousands of component library files it has to load  So unfortunately it's not going to be a good comparison  Hitting add component when I had a regular hard drive would cause the program to lock up for several minutes  With an SSD on SATA  it would lock up for 10 or so seconds  My 2016  Less than a second  No lock up  either  Just a brief pause before the list populates   Also Fusion 360 took a good long while to load on my old machine  Few seconds now  Used to be a wait switching between model  render  similar and sculpt modes  now there isn't any  This isn't a free program  though    Starting up normal applications like mail or calendar is more iPhone like than computer like  They finish loading before the icon has finished bouncing the first time

Well  shield and defensive duelist can't stack because they are both reactions   They are just different options if you don't want to expend a spell slot every time on shield   On the other hand  with an AC of 29  potentially 31 with a magic shield   you probably won't need either of those reactions very much

I really do think that the catastrophe that was Mighty No  9 is getting lost among all of this hatred for No Man's Sky  MN9's mistreatment ruined a legendary game developer's reputation  soured the opinion on an entire method of funding project development  and destroyed the public opinion on a development studio that had otherwise made good games  If you include the Red Ash nonsense as part of it  it is absolutely a bigger deal than No Man's Sky releasing to middling scores

Fair enough  given that the context was Rogue One and a writer allegedly making a statement about Canon continuity  I've been shying away from the Legends part of the equation  I stand by what I said before  "White Supremacist" does not rightly apply to Palpatine's Galactic Empire in the context of Canon Continuity  I'm pretty sure it wouldn't even apply in Legends  but I don't know if there is exists a non contradictory history of it  with how many different books and other materials were published

But it hasn't been held togther by tape  it has an average of 60 000 players every day and is mostly held together by the community  similar to how Skyrim has been held together by mods  I know TF2 has gone through a bare bones year for new content  but TF2 still retains plenty of activities for all sorts of people  and of all the cosmetically driven games out right now  TF2 is not only among the first  but has the most established economy  has plenty of ways for people to get what they want for the lowest price  and still does not require the player to put down any form of investment  I don't think I need to explain why TF2 isn't held together by string  and while community content helps TF2 to become a more enjoyable game  it does not need it to become enjoyable 
Ive actually never placed much weight on it either  I was mostly just teasing you

Your "rant" sounds more like a rave  I actually do have reason to rant about this game  I'm really trying to enjoy the game but the bugs are quickly draining my interest  I'll just list some of them out here       At one point I lost the ability to warp  no idea why and I can't replicate it  Fortunately it happened right at the beginning  I restarted and haven't seen it since     Another time the sound cut out on me at a critical moment  Happened early in the game  just as I was grabbing a winch thing out of a car trunk     I'm convinced the iron sights are off and not aiming correctly  so I strictly use the laser dot which unfortunately goes the other direction and seems entirely too helpful  I feel like an expert sniper with my Colt 44  In both cases it's immersion breaking     The gun belt feels like it sits too low way down at my thighs  while the grenade harness feels like it's too high  almost at my neck  I think the reason for this is that the reloading mechanism is smack dab in the middle and that this design choice resulted in a weird compromise that feels wrong in every way     I've soft locked the game more than once because items  like GUNS   fall below the terrain and are unreachable      There are also some pathing problems with some of the zombies but this is a minor complaint   The game is well conceived  I love the voice acting in the story mode  good writing and execution  Exploration is linear but it works  There are enough jump scares and enough challenge to keep the heart racing even in easy mode  But the game is  sorely  unpolished  Most of these bugs are not platform based  they're not dealing with driver nonsense or missing DLLs  they're strictly game play issues that either went untested or uncriticized

The main ones were carpets  paint and blinds  My brother works for a local leasing company  and he was the one who went through apartments after the tenants left to make those itemized list and he said that mine had pretty standard charges that they charge everyone   I'm pretty sure I didn't do any damage or spoil the blinds or the paint  As far as the carpet goes I don't have any pets didn't spill anything or trudge in mud  I assume he's probably more responsible for the wear and tear of the carpet over his 10 months as I am for my two months  I probably touched the blind twice the entire time I was there  And I think most apartment complexes paint the walls in between leases  at least they do around here

I was kidding around  MGS5 is pretty much the same as MSG4 in terms of cutscene treatment  I love the franchise and the convoluted stories are a part of the charm  but it's hard to praise MSG4's plot  It was so over the top  Maybe that's what people are looking for  but at least MSG5 is easier to follow  even if it's not as dramatic

Fair enough  I just figured that the current rate is  9 99 so I assumed that is what I'd be charged and why I didn't turn it off auto renew  
I think you are on the right track  but here's how I personally think about it   With you're example of owing 50K in taxes I'm gonna estimate that to be based on 150K gross income  since taxes are usually around 1 3 of that    Your gross income  was  150K   You are paying  2688 per year towards your lease as a business expense   So your taxable income is now only  147 312  150K minus  2688   You now only owe  49 104 in taxes for each of the 3 years you are leasing the i3  1 3 of  147 312   Make sense  Not the biggest saving  but every bit counts   and 80  of the gas you buy would also be deductible

This isn't even needed  IMO  I just did all the side quests  and very few hunts   Rank 3 I think    Before chapter 8  Was level 60 when I beat the game  Doing the two lowest level end game dungeons without using a camp in between  using the 3 0 got me from 65ish to 90  It's really not worth the time to farm that many coins   I only have like 14 and haven't used a single one    Just play the game and you'll get to 99 easy   This isn't a chore like it is in older games

You and I sound alike OP  I'm in second year  just got an 80 average last semester and also enjoy using different drugs  I dab and smoke  mostly vape  weed daily  and this past year just got into trying psychedelics like LSD and Mushrooms  I've also tried cocaine and vyvanse but I wasn't as into those experiences as the aforementioned psychs  They've been really eye opening experiences  and although sometimes I feel like slowing down my drug use overall  the only drug I really come back to consistently is good ol weed

  Would you say that wholesome role is something he kept after the Cosby show  but before recent scandals of course   As I understand he had still a pretty full career after the show  right   Most definitely  He went on to have another moderately successful sitcom simply titled 'Cosby'  his previous TV wife was also in this new sitcom as his wife  but they played different characters   He was in a fairly popular show called 'Kids Say The Darndest Things' where he would interview children in front of an audience  the humor was mostly in the silly  innocently cute answers that the kids gave to his questions  He also had a kids cartoon called 'Little Bill'   All of this was due to his wholesome image  The 'worst' thing anyone could say about Cosby at one point was that he was too harsh in criticizing the black community  during various public speeches that he gave to black communities     but he was still well loved and respected

It does though  She doesn't want to be around people because they'll only get hurt because of her and she realizes she can't have a normal life with friend like she thought  She retreats home because her family  are possibly the only people close to her the WF wouldn't mess with  especially on Menagerie  or so she thinks   She knows things will be awkward but it's her best option other than just roam Vale forever  She gets there and turns out the WF are up to shady stuff there so she has no choice but to investigate

Room names aren't as important as direction  If you are watching cams  use direction relative to the player you are trying to help  as well as general room discriptions  on house for example  if your team is upstairs  and enemies are coming up a set of stairs  you really just need to say if it's the west or south stairs or whatever their directions actually are  You don't need to be too detailed  but simple cardinal directions are enough for most players to get facing the right direction

  However I believe that all of those abilities  which are point and click  track the target until it connects   Not completely true as Butcher's and Varian's charges have a limited range  meaning that after going for like 4 seconds in Butcher's case  he'll just lose all momentum and stop dead in his tracks if he doesn't impact  Varian does the same  but only charges for like a second

As the other player said healers are very balanced   Disc can put out a bit more dps in a dungeon but lack healing throughput   It means with a good team who can dodge everything disc can be one of the best for mythic   a single mistake though can wipe them because they don't recover as well as other healers   Outside of that the healers are really well balanced in raids and bgs   Arena can be a toss up  it mostly depends on the comp for that   Each healer has different pairings they work well with     Solo content I would probably have to say druid pr monk because of being offspec tank    Once you reach a certain gear level tanks generally become some of the best solo farmers because they tend to be best at tanking large groups of mobs or doing old raids

  Honest question  why do you want to upgrade so badly  Is early2013 much different than late2012  I could see mine easily going another 2 years   Not OP but another perspective   I want a new MBP soon because of Applecare   Now  I haven't had anything major go wrong on this particular Mac  but my previous one needed two logic boards and a screen   Without Applecare  any one of those would have been over  500 to fix   So once Applecare runs out  my machine is a gamble ticking timebomb of an expensive repair   I usually get the   1500 model  use it for three years  and resell it for around  500   So owning a mid spec Mac usually costs me around  350 a year  and I'm content with that   It's possible that drawing it out another year could lower my overall cost  but it's just as possible that it costs me an extra  500 for that fourth year  and really by then software tends to be outpacing the hardware anyway   So I've always felt justified in replacing around every 3 years or so     I don't think I will this time  though 
yet only one of those words fit with EDs gameplay

Same  not sure why she is getting downvoted as everyone's skin is different  In my teens I had horrible acne and over the years I spent thousands of dollars and years trying to find a skin care routine that worked out for me   I got so upset when a college roommate  who had flawless skin but never washed  moisturized  went to bed in makeup constantly etc  would ask "Well do you wash your face " after I complained about my skin  Ugh
On one hand  it definitely should for consistency  and simply because it makes scaling the skill a bit more normal  On the other hand  that modifier is very very strong in the current state of the game  especially so on a fire s kill  If they fix double dipping in 3 0 that definitely give them no excuse to make this change

  Path of Exile  Atlas of Worlds  I come back and play 1 2 char's up to the 90ish range every league  hands down the best F2P game ever made in my opinion  and arguably the best ARPG ever as well     I certainly wouldn't say the game doesn't have flaws  boring initial levels  the imbalance between life ES to name a few  but to me the core gameplay is good enough to more then overlook these things   I think it's worth noting as well that the devs obviously really care about the game and are always working to fix issues as best they can as well  such as adding in lockstep  adding more server locations  etc 
Why does this have to get to aggressive  I thought this was a joke sub

 Oh boy    You haven't read much of their forums have you   I go on the official forums and reddit all the time  I'm pretty critical of a lot of things  FM  posts are pretty rare  except for the odd "Why cant I FA OFF without losing speed so I can escape better" which they USED to have things like that  but it made the game impossible to kill people  That's where the artificial nerfing came in  No more compass markers  arrows on edge of screen  yaw  blue zone  In the very early alpha they had unrestricted everything  but it was a one dimensional nightmare    Rotation rates were killed so much that rotating onto a target is night impossible   Because in the Alpha  when rotations were high it was exactly like Star Citizen   rotations are cheap  efficient  in space  so everyone was doing it over actually flying  They nerfed it primarily to switch it from aiming priority to flying     It doesn't  so this is not a concern  You can orbit people faster than 1  They can react  and 2  they can rotate on you  It is definitely possible   I don't believe you can orbit faster then someone can rotate  Unless it was a Caterpillar

Interesting bit about half way through      Perhaps that should not be a surprise when  on the first occasion  Giggs was summoned for an interview about taking over from Francesco Guidolin but apparently blew his chances because the clubs American owners were unimpressed by the way he projected himself  a revelation that  out of common courtesy  the relevant people really ought to have kept to themselves      It ended up as public rejection from the club currently bottom of the Premier League and it does throw up a question about where  or when  another opportunity might materialise in the top division  or whether Giggs might have to realign his sights now it is becoming increasingly apparent that potential employers are not seduced by big name players in the way that was once the case     Not that it is a necessarily a bad thing to start a little further down the food chain  Sir Alex Fergusons managerial career began at East Stirling  where he inherited eight players and his first signing was a goalkeeper who  at a conservative estimate  was two stone overweight  Brian Clough started at Hartlepools United  with its leaky roof and superfluous s  and Bill Shankly had spells at Carlisle United  Grimsby Town  Workington and Huddersfield Town before all the glory at Liverpool  Antonio Conte  the manager of the current Premier League leaders  was relegated to Serie C1 with Arezzo in his first year of management and if Giggs wanted examples more relevant to his own career he might reflect that Steve Bruce  his former United colleague  had spells at three different clubs in Englands second tier  and Wigan Athletic another rung down  before working his way up     The question is whether Giggs would be willing to do the same and  though it would be a climbdown for the man Van Gaal anointed as his natural successor  he is reaching the point where if he wants to come in from the edges it might have to be that way     In total  35 of the 92 clubs in Englands top four divisions have hired new managers  six more than once  since Mourinhos appointment on 27 May  Swansea did at least interview Giggs  but Crystal Palace  Hull City  Everton and Sunderland did not  There was a brief link with Nottingham Forest  one of the Championships many basketcases  but so little otherwise it is tempting to wonder whether Giggs may have suffered indirectly as a result of Gary Nevilles failure at Valencia  Or  to put it another way  would potential employers be more emboldened if Neville  with the same kind of qualifications and background  had not found it so difficult transferring all that insight and opinion into the sharp end of the business

I actually had to deal with this in my Adventure League game I ran yesterday  The druid started with an awakened elephant  the barbarian had a shield guardian and a horn Valhalla he decided to be nice and not use it  and the druid used bag of tricks to keep summoning animals and conjured dryads constantly    I was running Assault on Maerimydra which is listed as an 8 hour module  First encounter I ran it at intended difficulty and they melted it  Then I ran the next at very strong and they didn't blink  So the next encounter after the fire giants hit the barbarian and realized the shield guardian was soaking the hits  I had them focus it  I managed to kill the shield guardian in that encounter and got the elephant low that the druid was making it dodge every turn  He started spawning dryads at that point and have them spam gooseberries  He also had them constantly cast entangle which even with the super high strength saves the monsters kept failing    At the point they got to the tower I made it so any summon the druid had were killed within the bounds of reason  the druid left the elephant behind because it couldn't fit   Grazzt killed all the druid summons with his legendary actions but even then it took 11 hours to finish the adventure  Summons just make the game drag on for so long  I would allow for players who I feel could do summons fast enough that it wouldn't drag the game too much because even a fast player will drag a bit when handling summons

Why 
No  but your parents income will be used to determine eligibility for them  regardless of their willingness to pay or not  It's absurd but that's unfortunately how the system works  You might try going to community college part time while working  and once you hit the independence age at 24  then transfer to the university and finish the degree

If you compare him to dragon warrior it's insane    He has one less stat point on evolve for one less mana  which is great already    But he can also hit face with his evolve if he wants to    AND it spellboosts his hand    AND you can save it to use it later if you want       He's miles better than dragon warrior    But dragon warrior is already a top tier card  He's in the top three of the busted 4PP evolve followers club with fencer and baldy    But levi is fucking better than that       The only reason levi has not been the focus of a witch hunt is because rune did not have an aggro tempo deck  Well they do now

Definitely  it was a good deal  And it's quite understandable why he was so cheap as he comes from a rather obscure football nation and only played for mid table clubs throughout his career  so his 'profile' is fairly low  He also doesn't have much marketability or re sell value since he's 31 already and anything but a flashy player    Sometimes clubs  and especially fans   are too obsessed with flair  big names  marketability or potential that they overlook  or refuse to  cheap  useful and risk free options

Good points  I hadn't thought much about the mood of the film but you're right it did capture the rebel force vibe  Also the shots were great and the movie looked nice    Personally I wanted Donnie Yen to be the main character  I wanted him to be a full fledged jedi who maybe dies a heroes death against Vader  You make valid points though

My point was not to diminish their flaws or claim that Ruby or Jaune need to be perfect or always do the right thing  In Jaune's case  I understand his situation  which is why I gave him a pass on his words to Qrow  Either way  it was still rude as fuck for him to say    For Ruby  my issue is whether or not the writers will address what happened  I don't care for her reasoning for butting in  honestly  That said  there is a point where she should be smart enough to realize that there is a reason  the bad luck semblance or Tyrian'a strength  that Qrow is telling her to back off  Instead  she naively jumps back into a fight against an opponent who has already broken her aura  and she still didn't know his other capabilities or even Semblance  She went in blind  like a moron  You would think that  because  of Pyrrha dying  Ruby would be smarter about how she engages a much stronger opponent  especially one that has already beat her once

Zul'Jin isn't an orc  We do have five orc heroes though  Thrall  Rehgar  Samuro  Gul'Dan and Rexxar  The only ones that I can kind of see looking similar are Rehgar and Thrall as they are both melee heroes and have some somewhat similar animations  The others though have different clothes  Gul'Dan  different body type  Samuro  or have a different skin color alongside the fact that he has a pet  Rexxar   Azul'Guldan is also an orc but no one counts him because he's too fat     It's more body shaming than racism  
It was a "404 not found" joke   I thought most people would figure that  Since the Snorlax is clearly shown in this screenshot  
Was gonna post this  The fact that they completely dropped all the advanced dekes in transition to the current gen is unacceptable  Sure  they weren't the most useful things in the game  but those few times when you actually pulled them off and it lead to a goal    Amazing  Zetterberg was my favorite   Plus  shootouts and the actual shootout mode are extra boring without them  Like there's only so much you can do with few toedrags and basic skillstick

  You still have not been able to link or name a study or at least a journalistic analysis going into this that supports it   That is because you don't prove a negative  You are the one claiming that statistics are inflated because of the difference in laws  I addressed all "sources" you provided  which either contradict  don't support  or are irrelevant to that argument    In the other hand there seems to be a broad consensus backing my point of view  First of all  no there isn't  Second of all  consensus is irrelevant on fact   All those things   EXIST   and are extensively covered in the 3 videos i linked  but hey  they don't agree with your narrative  so they are "biased" and not worth looking at  Continue to plug your head in the sand and pretend those things don't happen  The police   ARE   fighting this  This is addressed in all 3 videos  There   IS   an opposition party that keeps saying this stuff  Sweden Democrats have won 0 seats in 2006 and every election prior  They are predicted to win a majority in the 2018 election  Their popularity is almost purely due to them being the only party addressing the insane immigration and crimes associated with it  There   ARE   plenty of criminologists and sociologists supporting this  and many of their reports are presented in those videos  We   DO   see the thousands of victims that are constantly raped in various concerts and gathering by immigrants  Some of them can be seen in those videos i posted  This one actually makes me angry  There are women whose lives were destroyed and they are trying to stand up and tell the world  wile people like you are just ignoring them and refusing to listen  "They don't exist"   Why does no one seem to be able to produce data to irrefutably disprove    BECAUSE STUDIES DO NOT DISPROVE THINGS    but prove them  Find me a study that proves unicorns or dragons don't exist  Find me a study to say GOD doesn't exist  Studies regarding immigration and their affect on things like crime are considered "racist" in Sweden  so they are not ever done  Police are not legally allowed to record racial characteristics of the perpetrators  If an Immigrant from Somalia rapes someone  the report will never mention that he is an immigrant  or Somalian by birth

You mentioned "any sound waves generated from the object" as the source of the sonic boom   Just curious  for say a military jet  how much of a sonic boom is due to the air flow turbulence etc caused by the fact that something is moving very fast and how much it is engine noise   Paraphrasing  how loud  proportionately  would the sonic boom be if a jet was going Mach 1 1 then just totally cut its engines

Used to work for a UK based retail company that worked with and stocked Nvidia cards  Legally if you write into them  more specifically their legal department   they would have a backlog of competition winners  should somebody lose and sue them or something     You can try that if you want  but in all honesty check the T C's to see if it even says there is an announcement to be made  likelihood is that they picked a random user  Dm'd them  got no response and gave it to a staff member auctioned it in the office

I used to but that video quality is soo bad 
Their debut album was so disappointing to me  The two songs I initially heard from it were so sleek  wild  and  above all   interesting   Beyond those two tracks  they just didn't have a lot to offer for me  Mostly stuff that I'd put on par with any other average electro swing act  which was a shame because those other two tracks were   exactly   what I'd always wanted from the genre 
Thanks  I didn't know about it

Reading the wiki is your best bet to learning without someone going out of their way to summarize     To start you off there I would read about switch types   Switch brands  Board sizes  If you think you well want to buy new keycaps to get the aesthetic that you see with a lot of these posts   read about those   Then added functions such as leds and boards like ergodox    That should help you focus on the essentials

There are a lot of different ways to reorganize the divisions  but lets face it Bud Selig moved his team out of a tough division to an easy one at the time  and to offset the ballence grabbed the NL central team up for sale and threw them to the dogs  the AL West    Now I always thought putting Colorado in the AL made sense  THINK OF THE DINGERS of a DH at colorado    Can't really compare NFL division allignment with MLB's  since they both have different cities in use and the NFL has a lot of teams in the South  more than baseball anyway   Besides the Cowboys are in the NFC East  old owner Tex wanted better TV revenue in the 60's  while their stadium is west of the Rangers  who are in the AL West   Its all about historic context with these allignments

The problem with Dreams is mostly that it's impossible to showcase effectively  I've seen 3 demos of the game and I still can't even begin to picture what the actual game is like in terms of creation  exploration  and gameplay  It seems like the kind of game that's going to need YouTube exposure to catch on 
I don't like guys who get into bar fights  I view them as prideful  impulsive idiots  It shows a short fuse and lack of self control  Both things I don't want out of a friendship or romantic relationship  If they treat a slight from a stranger with violence  then what hell awaits behind closed doors    There is nothing wrong with not being a brawler  It's smartest to avoid those conflicts all together  When that is not possible  it's smart to talk your way out of a fight if possible  even if you are a skilled fighter  you never know if the other person is secretly armed  if they have friends who will jump you or what sort of legal trouble you'll land yourself into  At best  you'll ruin your fun night out  which is reason enough to avoid barroom brawls   But things can easily turn out much worse

Probably because we are so adapted to human skin tone etc  that our brains can pick out what is real and what is fake  Since we can't actually conceptualize what alien skin would be  real or fake is no different to us  Think about it like being scared as a child by a man dressed in a costume  over time we learn and accept that it is fake and not a threat  except clowns fuck that shit

this is a rule that flies under the radar n terms of gameplay basically always  but I would change the way that layers work such that you can make cards with abilities similar to "creatures you control with first strike get  1  1"  the way the game works right now some effects cannot refer to each other simply due to the way that layers are applied  I would like to change the rules such that effects which are currently possible due to layer order have at least some posibility

They absolutely do have value  The casual gamer is becoming more and more of a norm and  reviews catered to them are very interesting and important  That doesn't however take anything away from the hardcore audience who needs reviews that do their research and understand all aspects of a game  Both are equally important depending on what kind of consumer you are

Radio can be the worst because it's almost like water drop torture  drip  drip  drip  The Abrahamic god religions have the FM band from 88 up to about 92  If you are on a rural highway at night  that will be all there is  If you are on a long winding lonely stretch of a rural highway and it's only religious channels  it does feel like the beginning of some horror movie like House of A Thousand Corpses  It's so weird to see this ancient goat and sheep herder religion so deeply entrenched in 21st century America  but even the calendar has been hijacked and made a Abrahamic god religion calendar  A large part of the US population is mentally defective

I work full time now and go to college full time as well  but I've always at least had a part time job  or even two  and it's never affected my financial aid  Mostly because I wasn't making that much money yearly  I just started a full time job this summer   Especially if you are listed as an independent  you'd have to make shit tons of money at a job before it starts messing with your financial aid   Working and going to school is a tough balance  I am in a program with a lot of business classes so I take the bare minimum full credits  3 classes essentially  so I can put in effort into those classes  I also take as many online options as possible so I can ideally do most of the work on my days off    I agree with others about possibly finding a job on campus  My school has some dorms and they fire on a bunch of people to basically check people as they come and go  Easy money  plenty of time to do homework  A lot of the office jobs around campus don't mind if you do homework when its slow    As for me  I live in a big city so I would have roommates regardless  but I live with my boyfriend  We both pay rent  food  etc  but neither of us have cars so we dont have to worry about that  Depending on where you live  you might be able to take care of rent with a part time job  but it might be better to spend a lot of time at campus doing homework and saving up money for down the road  Or potentially live on campus  depending on how it'll affect your school debt

Eve Online has always had really helpful people playing it  most even document for internal audiences and then there's Eve Uni too of course   Getting up to date information relevant to that is easy to understand from the readers perspective can even be an end game goal for individuals   Join us or them  either way the game is better when everyone strives to further their understanding and indeed manipulation of the game mechanics to further their own goals   It may sound selfish as it is  but Eve is not a fair game and it's not really intended to be played under "fair circumstances"   Don't forget one point though   Market PvP can be a lot crueler than ship combat   Good luck in your future endeavors  perhaps you'll join Karmafleet  perhaps some other null sec group   Or maybe you'll go on to be a member or even leader of an influential low sec entity yet to be named   It is entirely up to you

Oxygen is incredibly reactive and thus can be a part of many chemical reactions  allowing the body to have one source for a large amount of metabolic processes  Nitrogen  the most common atmospheric gas  is very inert in its natural state and so a complex chemical system can't do much with it  Other gases are too rare

People enjoy this show for different reasons I guess  Some people watch for the fights  some watch for the characters  some watch for the plot  some watch just to see what happens  and some watch to analyze the writing and such  The result is people not understanding other people's reasons for watching enjoying the show and therefore downvote what they feel can hurt their reasons  And this isn't exclusive to RWBY  this has happened to many great and popular shows within the last few years  I wouldn't get discouraged about posting your opinion because it can still help point out what the writers can do better next time

Part of the skill ceiling in these kinds of games  Assassin's Creed MP  SpyParty  is learning how to move and interact with the world as an NPC would  or learning how to distinguish players from NPCs  I think removing player agency would kill too much of what makes these asymmetrical mp games so unique

Yes and I want to add to this that while the source is available     So you can at least explain trace bugs well if you have access to the compilers they use for their own releases     it is still under a very convoluted licence user agreement structure where nVidia has total control over which code you can actually deploy to end users  So you still can't fix bugs yourself  well you can do it in your test environment and then have it being useless while it gets stuck in some nVidia apathy burocracy maze  You are not allowed to release the fix in your own game  even if you already shared how you fixed it with nVidia  This is quite different from the  more common open source licences  https   en wikipedia org wiki Comparison of free and open source software licenses

more or less thats one order or ganymede could be between bastet and lushen  The only one that really needs to be refresh here is lushen thats why jamire is kinda meh  His speed lead is decent but so is bastets defense lead in this situation

I second this  Destiny was my first multiplayer fps  I've played cod  crysis  killzone in the past but never did multiplayer because I was bad at them   Not only did I find Destiny to be very unique in the gun play  but also not as overwhelming and I could play at my own pace  Especially with pvp

Generally  the racers aren't too much trouble to cop  The midnights that released about a month ago were pretty hyped but you can find them now for under retail  same thing with the pure platinum's and multi colors  
God damnit i paid two times 2900 yens without realizing the problem  i did the second 2900 yens by mistake too   I thought it just didn't worked at first but then i received the mails from google play that i did pay for the quartzs  Still have nothing after 3 hours and i don't know how to get refund      I'm feel so fucked right now  does someone know how to be refunded

If they make the rest of the orders until Solomon  Salmon King     I hope they do it   Well  maybe they don't make a entire party of servants for Ritsuka  I hope that he has more servants than Mashu  since in the game you can summon and make a team of 5      Other change could be that Jeanne Alter it's an Avenger in the anime instead of Ruler   In the final order  the temple of Solomon I hope they make that Ritsuka use Mashu's Shield to hit Solomon  I think it'll be better than a fight only with fists 
 They are releasing it  https   survivetheark com index php  articles html ovis   But you were too busy getting outraged at nothing to know

I wonder if the HGC money made the relationships between organizations and teams a bit harder  With the players getting paid by Blizzard  the organizations may feel they don't need to offer much and the team might wonder why they need the organization    Seems odd that we see so many splits when more external money has been added to the scene  
It wouldn't surprise me in the least if he did  He has a legitimate shot of being the all time WAR leader for batters

I was in a game the other day and in the first round I accidentally walked into a Kapkan trap blowing me and a teammate up  I had a vote kick against me and a message asking 'wtf dude'  I won the next round all on my lonesome  I actually posted the video on reddit earlier  and sent a reply asking if it made up for it  he left after

Shit is expensive  I live in a poor as shit state  Moving to any other state would be a huge jump in cost of living not to mention the money one needs to actually move  make deposits etc  If I'm having a hard time in Podunk  Nowhere I'm not really in the position to save money and move to a bigger city in a nicer state  
Ahh   Great idea    I remember a tutorial doing something like that a while back to copy game data   I'll give it a shot and update my results for any future requests  
Oh yeah  I can really see how not knowing how Git and GitHub work can screw you over when doing things like that  But even then I found it somewhat difficult to follow how I was supposed to flash my new keymap using QMK  And I don't know about the Atreus  but working with QMK is much easier on Linux than it is Windows   But I hope you can look back at that time as something you have learned from  Because I assume you know how to clone a repo from GitHub now  So if you have to do that in the future  it will be much easier 
Maybe he's just not that good   He never exactly lit it up for Utica     Healthy scratch is my  call
I had hoped that by understanding the differences would open the door to discussing the emotional contingency  Because of the guilt and feeling of powerlessness that comes from addiction cycling  discussing symptoms  withdrawals  and PAWS doesn't necessarily help   especially if there is a fear of those things from previous attempts   The clinical withdrawal from cessation isn't anywhere near the reports  Please understand  I don't doubt for a moment that the descriptions given on that sub were really perceived   How much of that was placebo effect from the fear of discomfort  In all fairness  I've been challenged that the effect I get from mitragynines is disproportionately felt  Maybe you and they might consider that the placebo effect is real and impactful   I'm not qualified to answer the question of how much a different approach would help  but I do know this much  From my own experience  and the peripheral experience I have with friends and family led me to question why the underlying unaddressed need that drives addiction isn't being talked about 
I try to  I also tend try to transmute my stonehide   stormscale into herbs  For 5 of each leather you get roughly 3 or each herb give or take  and transmutagens you can use to make blood of sarg  I don't have a LW so I'd rather have the herbs

We should probably put this higher for people who wonder how to duplicate this result   OP clarified elsewhere     Some older missed payments did disappear this year though  which affected my score positively  That's probably a very significant contributory factor here   This is an established credit history that had some old derogatory entries that went away     It's not typical to see a credit score grow 180 points organically in one year just due to making timely payments

An eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind    This kind of thirst for vengeance comes from the baser aspects of our psychology  from the violent and unthinking evolutionary remnants of the nonsapient animals we once were    In order to progress as a society  in order to create a better future for our children  we must leave this sort of thinking behind us and create a world ruled by compassion  sense and doing what is  right  rather than what  feels good

Bethesda Softworks does in fact own both id and Arkane   And if you want to quibble about the name of the studios replace those games with ANNO and The Division   EDIT  Before you mention it Zenimax is basically a shell company that was created by Bethesda  probably for tax and or investment purposes

I mean  while you are probably partially correct that kinda doesn't give enough credit to all the work he puts into his videos    TB has never been one to shy away from the fact that he wants ad money but that's why sustains him  and people like it so it's kinda win win  I doubt it's simply to moonrise ad revenue  I dare say that's a little    cynical    
What I'm saying is that when compared to other non mainstream radio artist the average hip hop fan is going to have no idea who they are in comparison to someone like Kodak Black who while not being on the radio you're going to be hard pressed to find someone who doesn't know who he is  Shit Denzel Curry is probably more well known  Basically they're not buzzing

Well it kind of depends if youre saying you want light as in you want it skinny  or light as in you want less ice or less syrup or something  They might ask you  But technically if you said light I'd assume you want skinny  which means sugar free syrup and non fat milk instead of whatever milk we use  for most espresso drinks it's 2 percent and for frappuchinos it's whole     But i don't know why the taste varies    it could be that the person just didn't make it right lol

Thank you for the clarification  I was confused as catholic Christmas is over and orthodox Christmas hasn't started yet  so nye would have been quite a strange time for using Santa as something symbolic  This way a Santa costume might have just been a good carmouflage  if the city is full of Santas anyways

Volcano is mostly a ranged thing  the only time I ever worry about it when doing 12  is if the range is getting too close  For Necro  as a guardian druid  it makes one of my best mitigation tools useless  I might have a shitton of mitigation other than Enraged regen  but I can't seem to have enough utility to kite those little shits enough to let my stacks fall off     Last dungeon I did i sat at 20 stacks on average  I hate necro

You are Exactly right TXTiki  I know there is a lot of sniper hate but lets be honest  that hate is towards those 10 snipers on your team that are 2000 meters out with one kill to show for it and 200 points the entire match  Those guys do not help their team  But sniping in this fashion 100  helps and is supporting the team  This is the snipers role  pick off targets assaulting the objective  counter snipe  and spotting   No one should be hating on a sniper that plays like this

Exactly  We always had to keep continuity  see them take the item  pocket it  and go out the door without loosing sight   If you lose sight for even 5 seconds you have to assume they dropped the product and it isn't worth the risk of confronting them and making a false arrest  We usually had one floor walker and one guy on camera so hard to loose sight of people  but it happened from time to time   If I did loose continuity what I would do is then make myself really obvious after that I was watching them    follow close  stare  etc    untuck my cuffs    turn my radio loud    or even walk up next to them and "accidentally" drop my badge on the floor right next to them  we were allowed having badges at that time   That would usually make them shit a brick and drop the pocketed item  which 99  of the time they still had  and leave the store  No arrest but mission accomplished

The original palette was a case with a mirror that held two trays inside  one with 32 eye shadows and one with 10 face powders  I used the candle method to depot both trays  I then selected 24 eyeshadows so I could make a new tray with more space for the labels  I used some cardboard  black paint  glue gun and black electrical tape to make the eyeshadow tray  With the face powders  I picked five and used more cardboard and tape to secure the powders to the bottom of the case and make the walls high enough to place the eyeshadow tray on top  I then designed the cover in Photoshop and printed out the labels    I knew I wasn't going to get much use out of it as it was  but the new palette makes me smile to see it with my other makeup

It's true that on a day to day basis it may not be a problem because it does not hurt  However  you're trying to achieve something and it is hindering your progress  If I was you I'd look up the sources I mentioned    Try squat with your feet pointing forwards and try screw your feet into the ground with external rotation of the hip  Activation of the glutes does wonders for your arches and squat alignment    If you're not sure try to hunt down a coach that knows what they are talking about as many do not

The term was coined because the oldest Millennials turned 18 at the turn of the Millennium  in 2000  so it should be common sense going off of the name that the oldest Millennials are turning 35 right now 
Mile racing is also highly tactical  To win you try stay around the same pace as the pack to conserve energy  hence why mile races are often extremely variable in times

It's not harmful as long as you're gentle enough to not cause physical damage to the tissues    The reason it's not recommended is because you're not allowing your pelvic floor muscles to develop and become strong enough to defecate on their own     It's similar to laxative abuse   There's nothing dangerous about it   but the more you do it   the harder it is to go without it   eventually you become dependant    Keep the muscles strong with various pelvic floor exercises  there's more to it than just kegels   and only use the vagina trick for major problems that you know are probably just a once off because of a minor dietary mistake

Close enough   s  I actually had the ewiz in my shop today  I'm pretty happy with the way things turned out 
I'm playing Witcher 3 right now    It had an  insane  amount of   hand crafted content    pay attention to that part  in comparison to Fallout 4  bar none  The vast majority of Fo4's content is arguably filler and "do it yourself" stuff  see  settlement building  which doesn't interest me in the slightest in RPGs   Fallout New Vegas arguably has way more hand crafted content than Fallout 4  and that game was made in 18 bloody months rater than supposedly 5 years   And Witcher 3's witcher contracts probably have more meaningful story written content than Fallout 4's quests  And I'm not even talking about Witcher 3's side quests     I'm on my first playthrough of Witcher 3 and have 100 hours so far  and a lot of that content is on side quests alone  I don't feel the same is true for Fallout 4 unless you like settlement building and radiant quests that tell you to go to areas to clean out so you can make more settlements

In theory it should be possible  but not using the electron gun refresh rate trick of days gone by  see the other answers in this thread as to why not    Given the availability of cheap processing power and reasonably priced optics  you could actually have a tiny camera in the barrel of the "light gun" which could take a zoomed in picture of a part of the screen and use real time image recognition to determine where you aimed   This would still be pretty expensive today  and likely have sub optimal latency   1 5s   but we'll possibly see something in the next 5 years or so

Idk how it went with Brave  but what was said Brave was simply pushed out by stronger entities  Razor was already dead when we joined in and it was more punishment for us that for then  We went to Bastion as we were being punished by Razor for active defense and Bastion were very active at defense  However they were order by goons to withdraw to LS which we didnt want to follow  but we left them in good terms and we highly though about Bastion leadership  About OSS  well we might kill it honestly  OSS was basicaly just one PVP corp while we are strong at PVE  Despite we do PVP we need some ground where to build ships and thats something that cannot coexist with nomad PVP corp

  That IS how some employers regard it  though  butt in chair time is meaningless  results and deadlines met are what matters   That can backfire horribly though  and result in everybody being overworked and management being unhappy because "nothing ever gets done on time"  unwilling to acknowledge a lack of manpower and thus deciding that the workers must be too inefficient  
well no but if every fucking player did it then it shouldnt appear  should it  C

The difference is that their entire legal  political and economical frameworks haven't spent 40 years being tightly bound up with the EU and becoming increasingly if not terminally reliant upon the single market and customs union to make up their own deficiencies   This is a bit like saying "Well  there are lots of other people out there walking around and running fine  so this particular guy who's just woken up from a 40 year coma ought to have full use of his limbs immediately"   Not that I'm equating the UK being in the EU to being in a coma  More like being on life support

His abilities are easy and straightforward but like anyone else there's good times to do it and bad times  I do think sometimes it's not as clear when to do what  Like his combo is straightforward 90  of the time but the times that it's not takes some thought to realize why you should do something different

I teach kids   Start with a story   A relatable story  maybe even a personal one since you'll know it the best   It is "personal" finance  after all   And pick a story that is age appropriate   If I were in your shoes  I'd talk about how I found out about taxes    You mean you don't get to take home the amount they pay you  WTF     From there you can then talk about how personal finance is part of everyday life  whether they know it or not  and give them some tips   Break it down into 2 3 bullet points    I'm assuming you may only have max 30 45min to speak    Put yourself in their shoes   If some random person came in to your classroom to talk about something you don't know  and you weren't going to be tested on it  why should you care   Some topics I would touch on would be   1  How to make money  aka how to find a job   Can't manage what you don't have   Perhaps point them to resources that the school might have   Pass out example resumes and examples of emails to send to potential employers   I hire people and a lot of them  young or old  simply don't know how to write a legible email   I'd guess that most of the class hasn't written a resume  either  or knows why you would need one   2  What is credit   They'll no doubt have seen commercials that talk about credit   So what does it mean   Relate it to trust  something everyone understands   This can then be connected to cars  houses  etc   aka buying something that you can't won't pay for all at once   3  Credit cards  and the pitfalls of credit cards interest rates   This is related to point  2   Perhaps ask them  given the idea that if you loan someone some money you'll want it back   some extra  what would be a reasonable amount you would charge "extra"   Ask the class   If I let you borrow  100  how much should I charge you for than  100   Then  bring them any credit card advertisement or fine print that shows them the outrageous interest rates they charge for carrying a balance   Even worse for payday loans   Use an anecdote to punctuate the point   You won't have to google far to get real world examples of lives mired by debt   high interest rates   Just some ideas   Above all else  make it relatable   Otherwise you're just talking to an empty room   Good luck

I know  I didn't mean that scene  I meant in general  Dub Tidus comes off as really REALLY whiney and it's really just   the way his voice was handled   Like  FFX is actually the most popular entry in the series in Japan and they LOVE Tidus and I did NOT understand why until one day I was scrolling through translated Dissidia win quotes and found some that was just some goofball taking the piss out of the entire Final Fantasy cast  I was like "Who's this guy  He seems fun and awesome " and I looked and   it was Tidus    It seems like in the Japanese one he comes off more as a goofy idiot hero  but the nasal quality of the dub made him seem more whiney than he was meant to be

If you have ever started up Bitcoin Core  previously called Bitcoin qt  using a version older than 0 13 0  there's a good chance your wallet dat is not HD   In which case  it will need to be updated occasionally   old wallets had a buffer of 100 addresses or so  so you don't need to update after every transaction    If the first Bitcoin Core you started is    0 13 0  you'll be good forever 
TBH you shouldn't have felt much of anything on 30mg plus a 30mg redose  That's barely a threshold dose of MDMA  Redosing simply prolongs a peak of the initial dose and is not necessarily additive  Did you test this stuff or just took what your friend told you  I recommend doing a bit of research before trying MDMA next time  Definitely don't waste the 40mg of whatever you have  30 days is not the recommended time between doing MDMA again  it is the recommended MINIMUM with 3 months being the healthiest and safest    Also  tightness in chest as in difficulty breathing  I'd recommend closely monitoring yourself and any breathing problems are usually good to get checked out  Hope this helps   
If they really cap it out at 250 pieces  that's a huge nerf for lots of players  plenty of mid game non late game people   On my 3rd account  which often got stuck doing B2   I'd still do 400 450 pieces   For people on B1  it's probably a huge buff  because they should be able to  I'm thinking   we'll see  be able to MANUAL to at least B3 B4ish

It wasn't being rude  If you're 15  5 years is a long time    Things that "stand the test of time" have to have been around for long enough for at least an amount of nostalgia to kick in  In gaming we should be talking at least a decade in my opinion  potentially even longer    Think about it  after the 6th Elder Scrolls game drops  will people still be playing Skyrim much  Probably not  Will people even hold the game in high regard  Possibly not  How will we know  Time will tell  It hasn't yet   If you were to nominate any Elder Scrolls game for the award  Morrowind is the obvious candidate  It's still held in high regards now    now it wouldn't get my vote  but at least it's be somewhat reasonable

They still fucking do it  which is why I'll never buy another of their systems   For the longest time this was their only marketing tool to sell 360s  and it still was with XB1  problem is now people care a lot less for their exclusives and wait for the games to be on PC   The way they advertise alone is laughable as it is  they STILL have XB1 commercials claiming that it's the only system with HDR when ps4 got the update for that function within days of the XB1 S launch   Phil Spencer is as deceitful as ever  and I won't let microsoft off the hook for that intrusive as fuck windows 10 upgrade campaign either

Modern Renaissance for sure  I just bought it yesterday because my Ulta was sold out of the Peach palette and also FINALLY had the MR in stock  managed to snag the last one   shadows are super pigmented and buttery  they blend almost effortlessly  Too Faced can be kind of hit or miss on some of their shadows  Like I love the Bon Bons palette  so I tried the Nikki Tutorials palette when it dropped  I brought it back the next day  the shadows  were chalky  lacking pigment and would not blend  
I'd rather have the PTRS  particularly at that price 
It annoys me as well  just try to remember that it means nothing and in a week everyone will have forgotten about it

NEW HOMES   Not all homes     We hear all the time about stagnating household incomes  the decline of the middle class  rising income inequality  and lots of other stories of gloom and doom for Americans  But when it comes to the new homes that Americans are buying and living in  we see a much brighter picture of life in the US    It seems to me this kind of reinforces that   Those that are doing well and can afford new houses are affording and building houses bigger than they ever have before   But that doesn't help people who can't afford new houses   I'd love to see them look into   sq ft of existing housing and then compare that to household income 
 However  if you can invest that money  May I remind you that if you have money in the bank  the bank loans said money out to borrowers of which some are investors

The point of the "millennial" tag is someone who spent part of their formative years around the turn of the millennium  1995 is the upper limit because younger than 5  you generally won't remember much  if anything  1981 is the lower limit because at 19  you have at least a general idea of who you are  You'll still change and grow  but less so than from say 8 16  the 'prime' ages for a millennial in the year 2000    That's why it's split up the way it is

Sure but that was enough to give Netflix the production power to start creating excellent exclusive content   As I mentioned in my first comment    Make movies available online with the global release  If people want to go to a theatre they will    I'm not suggesting that Netflix starts releasing movies exclusively  It can be any service

Same specs as you with the 2 9 GHz CPU  Love it so far  Haven't been able to test out battery life yet  but I like the trackpad  Honestly liked old mechanical over the force touch but I get the switch and support it  just hope I can find more use for it  as I don't think the most firm setting is clicky enough for me  coming from 2011 15"   Love the new keyboard  when I thought that would be what I hated the most  Touch bar is cool  Don't know why anyone would think of it as a negative  The 460 is much more powerful than I would have thought  and the SSD is great  insanely fast compared to my old HDD in my 2011  and even noticeably faster than when I upgraded it to a Sata III SSD  Screen is gorgeous and the space grey combined with how much slimmer this is than my 2011 is insane  Love TB3 USB C switch  one Satechi adapter is all I will ever need  and that probably wont be for too long  Only thing I'm not crazy about is the lack of magsafe  but I bought a Snaptnator through kickstarter and it seems great  plus I can use the snapnator on either side  and it basically improves upon all of the mistakes that Griffin Breaksafe made

I am in this situation right now  Friends gave me a few gift cards over the past two years totaling over  500  The Bay changed it system during this time when they added pins to their gift cards so I could not buy anything online  I went in store before X Mas to buy a few gifts using aforementioned cards   Nope  Balance is zero  WTF  6 friends all decided to give me all empty cards  Okay told to call this 1800 number  Wrong number  told to call HBC Mastercard unit  Call them  told to go back to the store and have the manager activate and call back  Manager tell me she is busy  "gift cards expire  you should have used them "   HBC must be thinking this is the 1600 century with their own Royal Warrant and expiring cards are illegal in Ontario   Okay   fine  I am going to give this to our LP Department to figure out this situation  oh  one card does not start with 4xxx  must be fake and that  50 is gone   ask your friend which cashier and what time they bought them two years ago   We'll call you tomorrow and issue you a new card on the other 5 cards    Been 72 hours    Fuck the Bay  No wonder your stock is a crashing aeroplane

The commercials before the movie previews are getting ridiculous  After the ads and the upcoming trailers  the movie doesn't actually start until 30 mins after the posted start time  e g  Cineplex says movie starts at 8 00pm but after ads and such  movie actually starts at 8 30pm   I'm on my phone when the commercials happen so I don't pay any attention  I don't remember what kind of commercials were being played when I went to see Rogue One  Out of sight  out of mind  With that said  ads aren't as effective as advertisers hoped to be so what's the point

So I'm gonna try and make sense of it  There's a lot of music that simply isn't made to only be "listened" to  Take Work for example  In the car  there's absolutely no way I'd listen to it  However  when you're out in the club and Work comes on  the atmosphere is different  It gets people going  it's simple  and it's fun to dance to  It's not a bad song  you just need the environment for it  This isn't always the case for EVERY song that's similar       I'm not going to listen to Mozart in the club  and conversely I'm not going to listen to Work in a coffee shop

I'm going to give a slightly different answer regarding lowering your Visa limit   Yes  the negative impact on your credit score is definitely something to consider   However  if you would spend less money  more than a trivial amount  then it might be a good idea   If the spending is necessary  groceries  bills you can pay via credit card  etc   then there's no reason to lower it  though   Another option would be to only use your card for regular bills and then  stop carrying it   use cash instead   
I tried skyrim a few years ago on PS3 and just couldn't seem to get into it  Since then I have developed quite the taste for rpg's all thanks to dark souls 2   Well up until a month ago DS2 was my favorite game of all time until I decided to give skyrim another go  The only game that comes close to skyrim imo is Witcher 3 when it comes to immersion but the fact that I was 100 hours into skyrim and had only just met the grey beards says everything  Witcher 3's world and quests were crafted with the same level of care as skyrim but still lacks that special something that Bethesda was able to capture   Don't ask me what that special something is because I can't quite put my finger on it   I 100  agree with everything you have said about  the community as well  I don't think I have encountered a single "elitist" know it all on this sub yet  Everyone has been super helpful even with the noobiest of questions

Copying my nomination from another thread  For information  I give you  u 1Upvote 1Respect's comment regarding the situation in Croatian football that led to Dejan Lovren not making the squad for EURO 2016    "True but there is more to this story  I'll just write a quick summary so that people who don't follow Croatian football get idea what is going on  Lovren used to play for Dinamo Zagreb  Dinamo Zagreb is owned by Zdravko Mamic  Mamic makes players sign unfair "slavery" contracts so that they have to pay him   of his paycheck even when they leave Dinamo  Even Luka Modric has to take something like 25 30  of his paycheck and give it to Mamic  Usually all this is hidden from the public  but some players decide to resist  Good example is Eduardo  who didn't want to give 40  of his salary to Mamic anymore and made his story pubilc  So far we know that Mamic is corrupt piece of shit  As stupid as it sounds Mamic also owns Croatian national team and gets to pick who is coach and which players will play  So Croatian coach Ante Cacic gave a lot of chance to Dinamo Zagreb's young players  Lovren didn't like not playing and he called Cacic on his bullshit and said something like  "Those young players from Dinamo don't deserve that much playing time  and they are only playing because it will boost their value  playing in a team with Modric  Rakitic  Mandzukic   co   so that Mamic can make more money when he sells them to European teams " Cacic and Mamic didn't like that so Lovren isn't playing  Good example is Croatian Euro squad  Remember Alen Halilovic  One of best Croatian young players with amazing potential  Well he isn't going to Euros  because Mamic already sold him and can't profit with him playing  Instead Marko Rog  Ante Coric and Marko Pjaca  all 3 Dinamo players  are included in squad  because they "deserve chance and are showing potential"  but the truth is they are going to Euro 2016 to increase their value  so that Mamic can sell them for more money into better club where they will get biggers salary  so that Mamic can take bigger cut "  From  this thread  https   www reddit com r soccer comments 4m0mjw juventus and liverpool fc are the most   
I agree with you 
i agree that skill is likely dumb  however situations you describe may be rare in random potato gmes

Yeah  then you can have some type of a discount and reward for actually playing the game

 You're being downvoted by the lazy millennials who still think everyone can just retire at 55 with a full pension  This is the comment that I replied to first and all I am implying is that 'just retiring' is not as hard or impossible for Boomers' as you made it sound  In fact  probably the generation that had the easiest path to retirement
My mom will be in a cheery mood and then be pissed off at something I did 4 days ago by the evening  She has photographs of my sister and I in her bedroom  but whenever I do something that pisses her off  which seems to be all of the time   she puts my picture away  My sister's picture has never been put away  It's something that I started noticing two years ago  Still hurts  can't wait to move out

Agreed  Playing the Walking dead games was just a matter of waiting for the next character to die off because you know it is inevitable  but To the Moon  you explored the life of a man through his memories as he lays on his deathbed  Trying to find out why he wished for what he did  It felt meaningful when you figured out a new piece to the puzzle  The Walking Dead was the weakest of all the games for that nomination

I see this in my own family    I'm old enough to be looped in with the Gen X'ers  but my heart and mind always find their way to the perspective of millennials    My older siblings were entitled with cheap college  low rents  plentiful jobs that didn't require networking ten years experience  ect     They easily blame others problems on them not working hard enough   It's tiresome    I'm so far in debt  from college  that I'll never climb out by the time I'm dead     Still  it's somehow my fault that my tuition rates were drastically higher and that I didn't get to live rent free with relatives  who also paid their ways through school

The storage is going to be a problem for anyone going digital even if they really do allow SD cards  the biggest economical card you can get right now is a 128gb Micro SD for around 40 bucks   going higher then that and your getting into "buy another Switch" territory depending on the price at launch

Thank you for your insight  And I did what I did because honestly I wasn't sure what I was supposed to do  She mentioned that she was  thinking  about a rent increase  and that it would  potentially  break down as such  The only notice of the actual dollar amount was mention the night I was trashed and this morning  which is why I say she notified me today    Usually I would just pay it and move on  but the way my housemates have been using electricity and water  this little bump could easily put me at the  800 level for a room I assumed I'd be renting for far less    If  25 isn't a big deal  why is it a big deal to her  I've been a perfect tenant  Like  perfect  To raise my rent 2 months into a lease seems a little abrupt  especially when the master rent on the house hasn't gone up for 2 years   Regardless  certainly food for thought  Thank you

If you have the money and you care about performance  I'd recommend it over regular Ps4 even if you don't own a 4K display   Parents had Ps4 in living room for their dance games since last Christmas  so I got to play with that a bit  I was primarily PC so I didn't care about anything other than Ps4 exclusives since normal Ps4 hardware was mediocre at best in 2013  I'm sitting with two GTX 670s in SLI  it can run most AAA games okay these days  but I'm not completely satisfied and don't want to spend more money on toys now that I'm transitioning into adulthood  Parents bought huge  4K TV and I played Rise of the Tomb Raider in 4K and it looked great  far better than what my PC could have done at any resolution  I tried   Then  I played in 1080p and it still looked good  even if framerate was sometimes lacking considering the lower resolution   But if you're just a casual gamer  regular Ps4 is fine 
I don't think so if you keep it on your lap 
Thanks

I think you're fine  drugs deplete certain vitamins in your body which can cause a variety of problems  also over exertion  dehydration  your brain is probably pretty tired too and can cause panic attacks and anxiety  I was up for 8 days once and clocked my heart at 170BPM and my chest was really tight  difficulty breathing  all that good stuff   turns out it was just a panic attack  Don't redose  eat some food  hydrate and sleep  Keep in mind it's still never a bad idea to check with a doctor if you feel you need to  it could save your life    Everyone experiences things differently  especially when it comes to drugs   if you read someone did x amount of drugs and was fine  doesn't mean you can do the same  1  Everyone's body reacts differently 2  Purity  you don't know how pure it is or what you're taking unless you test it  Play safe and take some rest

Honestly  you should have planned on respecing a decent amount later just to make it smoother  You get like 20 respec points just from quests which means all those Aura nodes could go into an easy to support DPS skill  Usually don't need to redo Ascendancy on SC as those cost 5 respec points each  but probably advisable if on HC

The Obsidian Sentinel build gains 100  absorption thru alchemy  and not some long convoluted loop with enchanting   Needs 3 ingredients  Abacean Longfin  Cyradilic Spadetail  and White Cap   Make a fortify restoration potion using the longfin and spadetail  then a second potion using all 3 creating a fortify restoration      This lets you gain a second restoration buff you couldn't gain by drinking multiple single effect potions   The higher your alchemy  the better    Make your potions  travel to the stone   Drink potion 1  then 2  then activate the Atronach stone   This boosts the absorption amount   Be wary that doing so also increases the amount magika regeneration debuff as well   But with so many options to boost that back up  that effect is well worth it    This option is good because if you can't get the full 100   you can simply level alchemy a bit more  or get some alchemy gear  then redo the process by choosing a different stone  then returning to the Atronach with improved potions

I think camping is more waiting at someone's spawn point rather than what you've suggested which are all valid playstyles more than anything  and this is more on the game's fault rather than the "campers"   I've had several matches  a minor number compared to the total  where we kept spawning in one area with the entire enemy team all on titans constantly one shotting us   If we were ahead then  not for long   The game generally spawns you at random spots but there's few instances where it would pick a bad spawning point and just never change its mind   What's the enemy team going to do   Walk away let us regroup   There should never be any instances where the game keeps spawning you in a tactically horrible situation and again  this falls onto the devs rather than the players taking advantage of the situation   Is it sporting   No   But war is never sporting

I enjoyed that it wasnt a time consuming thing to do and everything had relevance and was fun to do  There really wasnt any tedious trophies to acquire other than maybe the last one i got  gladios survival skill  which after i polished off the adamantoise i just rubber banded overnight to get because screw running around for days when i have a damn flying car  Im just glad the costlemark towers second dungeon isnt a part of the trophies because im not quite at that one yet  doing them in order  but judging by what people say about it  im not gonna enjoy it 
You don't understand because you're confusing wealth with class and confusing different 'crimes'    Yes  UK police do love to nab a toff   for financial crime and corruption  especially  But not really for 'party crimes' which are policed VERY diferently in the UK to the US  IN the US  it doesn't matter who you are  drink in public and you are getting a ticket   In the UK there are many different schemes aimed at stopping the lower classes from being seen when they drink  Community Support officers stalk the homeless through Leeds  moving them on from park to park  whilst students drink beer  until the police decide enough is enough  or families drink wine and pimms to their hearts content

In case you don't know this you should turn the cards in on a level 18 or lower character to prevent the aura implicits from rolling http   pathofexile gamepedia com Corrupted Sort by belt  you can see the auras require item level 19   Yes it would be quite good  The extra elemental damage stuff wont increase your poison damage  but all the extra movement speed  attack speed  crit and accuracy will boost your clearspeed a lot    And of course there's juicy stuff like soul eater and extra projectiles  
I second this  I didn't know about rerolling until much later  basically when I started looking at the subreddit   Honestly  rerolling isn't necessary cuz net decking to having efficient decks doesn't really matter until rank B or so  In fact  I didn't net decked until reaching rank A and climbed ladder with poorly optimized Control Blood deck

My stance is that an addiction has to be entertained through daily choices  We have a family friend who is dying at 45 because he drank like a hole for decades  His liver is dead  at 45  He had been told at least 2 yearz before that if he continued he was going to die  He's been told over and over and he did nothing  Everyone knows taking hard drugs is very dangerous and very bad for you  seriously  at least alcohol is a common thing but if youre taking heroin  Im sorry but you know exactly what youre doing and the risks involved    Do those people deserve to die  No  But when people on Reddit come and cry about how they're victims to this and that  talking about the crisis like it's a natural disaster that just randomly fell on people  that's bullshit  Addictions start by a choice and are entertained by choices  and the people who entertain addictions shouldnt be presented as pure victims wifh no control over their faith  Truth is  theyre fhe only ones with control over their faith if fhey dont want want to change  no matter how much money we throw at them  they'll never change  It has to come from them  I'm all for helping addicts get out of it  but this victim attitude and refusing to take any responsibility is garbage and I'm sick of reading it on Reddit

  They need to admit that their vision for the tMBP was just flat out wrong   Yeah  and this is why platform switch is the real answer for serious users   Could you actually imagine Apple doing that   The only time they did anything of the sort was when the company was openly failing and Jobs came back on board to slash their entire business model and start with a completely different vision   The death of beige  remember     Today  though  we don't have that kind of culture shift on the horizon for Apple   There is no Steve to come back and reboot the company   And they aren't failing   They won't turn back on the design decisions   The next generation will  never  be thicker  or heavier  or have more ports than the one before  and they will  never  bring back a feature or port that they've killed     No  the next iteration will double down   They'll find a way to make it even thinner  probably by gimping the keyboard the rest of the way and replacing it with a solid state panel   They'll reduce the battery size even further and make up for it by throttling CPU performance   Et cetera   And when Mac sales finally start to decline  they'll "boldly" stop making Macs  first by neglecting to update them for a year or two  then in some outlandish way like announcing a partnership with Microsoft to bring better iOS and iCloud integration into Windows     The writing is on the wall   For serious users  there's more justification than ever before to abandon the platform

I used to have pretty bad social anxiety but girlfriends and work helped bring that out of me   I used OKCupid  but that was about 2 years ago  I've always found that if you're honest and open  and not a complete arse   people respect that  and you can build from that respect   Though I'd better stop sputing generic crap as I'm hardly an expert and stuff and I can't really give advice apart from    do what feels right  Online dating  can  be good for introverts  but it takes time to find someone who suits you  If you don't like socialising or going out  don't do it  I didn't  and I gained all my confidence from work and relationships   Anyway  I'll stop spouting as I doubt you were asking for advice and I feel as though I'm at an age where I give it out without requests which probably causes people to want to tell me to shut up

Coquelin played 20  games in Ligue One when he was 19 20  Zelalem spent last season in the Scottish second tier  Just a wee bit of difference there   We can all think of late bloomers like Giroud who defy the trend  but most exceptional talents are well on their way by the time they're 19 20  That's especially true at a club like Arsenal  which is notorious for giving young players a lot of chances   Could Zelalem pan out  Anything is possible  but I'd venture to guess that it's highly unlikely based on his lack of tangible progress to date  The number of 20 year old reserve players who make it big is dwarfed by the number who never amount to much

I doubt there's anything super huge down there  because deep sea animals show a pretty strong trend toward being small  except among very small animals which are often larger   Few deep ocean animals are more than a meter long  There's probably a few unknown species of beaked whale out there  maybe a shark or squid similar to known species and a few meters long  but that's all I'd put money on in the "large animal" department   Still hoping somebody dredges up a trilobite someday  but I'm not counting on it   They say we know more about space than we do about the ocean  but this is only half true   It's true with  regards to one specific thing  it's easier to get a detailed view of the moon or Mars because there's not a bunch of water in the way   About all we have for the ocean bottom is sonar scans  and the detail is lower   On the other hand  we have much  much more in the way of physical samples from the deep ocean  as well as thousands of years of watching animals wash up on shore or catching them in nets   We've got core samples  we've sent down submersibles and rovers in many places  etc   In those ways we know more about the ocean

While Skyrim has stood strong for a while  it is primarily because of the mods  TF2 has survived due to Valve's success of implementing a cosmetic system  competitive support  the ease of picking up and playing casual  and the free to play release of the game sparking interest  Points can obviously be made for either game  but for the idea of "Test of Time"  TF2 simply has survived longer and has more active players  I understand Skyrim is singleplayer  and therefore a single individual could be worth more than one in a F2P team shooter  but it just shows more people are playing TF2 instead of Skyrim

I did the exact same thing the other day   Not a proud moment   I was trying to rage out quietly so I didn't wake my girlfriend  and I just smoked myself in the head with the controller hard enough to leave me with a decent lump for a few days afterward   The rage that this game creates within me is just amazing at times 
Thanks dude   By the way  Suit tossed around the idea of adding "Nuke" and "Wait" to the phases for izaro indicating if you had to wait to kill izaro or not for the buff to county  He definitely wanted feedback on the idea so I think here would be a good place if anyone is reading   My vote is for yes  and both Gargoyles and Portals can be nuked    Happy lab farming  
Yea  If I want to participate in the alpha for bug testing and just the general experience of the game before launch  I can upgrade to run the game right now as it is if I want to  p

Does it mater  
When they're "admitting" they have hacks  they could possibly be sick of explaining how they killed you  So instead they simply just say "ya I'm hacking"  They could've gotten a call out from a teammate  they could've heard you  they could've seen you on a cam etc  I've played this game pretty much everyday since the middle of January  I'm pretty used to just aiming where I think they will be  Whether they are standing  crouched or prone  you can adjust to it

You're annoying them for making them work   All that arm lifting   and ugh  the scanning   The worst

I think difficulty adjusts the "body" armor aspect of enemies and I don't think bombers have an actual head  like normal people  It's just like weird body armor  I'm just basing this on what I've played but on Normal  with Glaz  I believe I've be able to consistently one head shot a bomber  On realistic it's always taken 2

I had a hard time accepting that people would stay just to remain in the club   I assumed everyone was like me in that they stayed because they KNEW it was true   I honestly didn't know of any other type   I never was in for the social aspect  but only because I had a testimony  and was doing what I thought was right   When the children were shunned  I knew it was not what Jesus of the NT would do    and that is who I thought they followed   I just couldn't stay after that no matter how much green jello I might have been missing out on from there on out   Anyway  happy New Year to YOU

Just booted into skyrim and fallout 4  both look pretty damn good with the new update  The ability to use the vive controllers is great for setup and quick demos  but youll need a controller to actually play  It would be nice if we can get gesture support because the limited buttons definitely show when using the vive controllers 
It fires a slug  which is a solid projectile  rather than multiple little pellets    It does not 1 hit kill in CQB

All the tests of time were recent releases  The oldest one there  aside from AOE2 remaster  I'm not aware of if it's significantly changed from the original  is TF2  and it's really starting to come apart at the seams  so it doesn't really fit   If anything  CS GO should have been nominated here  because its old ass design is somehow still topping charts 
I don't think it's a big deal either  That's why i said STOP THE PRESSES  haha

I feel like the recruitment and the base feeling like home was a really awesome achievement  I feel like a lot of games in recent history have a base building section but somehow it doesn't necessarily feel like it's the center of your world  I guess Dragon Age Inquisition did manage to achieve this    I wish Fallout 4 had gone this route actually  Like a settlement that you are building up as a singular entity  It's a more guided narrative in a way but you could always offer to not make players do it  You could have done things like save people who had various skills and convinced them to go to your settlement or poached merchants from other settlements or brought mercenaries into your fold

Conan's reactions are not genuine   They're completely hammed up   As an entertainer should do      This is similar to the print news industry throwing a fit when people started going online for news because it was better   For years  self described critics have abused the framework they operate under   Now the framework is being rebuilt as they continue to rely on old models   Sucks to be them

I suppose it is sort of a spoiler  My apologies 
Just uninstall  AND delete it from your library as well  You can remove games so they don't even show as a gray uninstalled title in your library  Dota and other mobas are cancers that aren't worth it in the slightest  go play basketball or some shit if you want something thats fun to compete in without making you want to kill yourself
Won't spoil anything for you  but from a minmaxer point of view  Vampires are imho best for mages  you can get some very powerful items for them in sidequests  and if you are more of a Warrior you'd better fit into the Dawnguard and the stuff you get there   For a normal playthrough  Do you feel your character is evil  Do you think being a vampire fits the personality  Is it a good character that tries to save innocent people from being overrun by bloodsucking monsters  Game is more fun for me  when my character has some consistent lore behind it

I almost sided with the person you replied to  but I realized the OP was squatting 3 times a week  Definitely easy to go up in weight when doing that exercise a lot  Heck my 1rm for dl just went up 30 lbs in 3 weeks by doing it 3 days a week  My sleep schedule sucks too    Seems like OP was sticking to a good diet and sleep  Can imagine the gains will be plenty when properly focused upon

Why do you need tweaks for it lmao
Something you can try that is a bit risky is to backup all of your saves and wipe Skyrim from your computer  I don't think you actually have to backup your saves because the uninstall allegedly doesn't touch them  but it wouldn't be a bad idea   Then reinstall it and put your save files back       This risk with this is if those mod files in your data folder are indeed messing with your game and are thus involved in the save files  Upon wiping the game  your save files may become inaccessible without those mod files present  and you'll have to restart       I might be misunderstanding your problem  though  Do you want your mods to work  Did they ever work  and the game started crashing randomly  If you just want to go back to vanilla and you aren't attached to your saves  I would recommend what I said above  Even if you want to make the mods work  I still recommend resetting the game and trying again but with a good mod manager  I really like Nexus because it is very easy to download straight from the site into the mod manager and a lot of the popular mods have that option  A few don't  but most do       The deal with modding is that the more you get  more unstable your game will become  That's just how it works  If you keep it to a smaller amount of mods that are known to be compatible with each other and you use a mod manager  I think you should be able to get a stable game  Unless the issue is with your computer  not Skyrim  Then you're just screwed 
Yes

Related in a different context  it's like when I go to the hardware store to get supplies for whatever DIY project I'm currently working on and some male employee will ask what I need help finding   Which leads to them asking what I'm working on   Which leads to them telling me how I should be doing my project differently  Just yesterday I was there to get hooks to finish a gift i was making for my BFs mom and they were so expensive  so I was brainstorming alternative solutions    and the guy was like "well you could use invisible fishing line " And I was like "I get what you mean  but that really isn't the look I'm going for" and he was like "no it's invisible  so you wouldn't see it" and he kept trying to convince me that this was a great idea no matter how much I protested  so finally I was like "NO  I understand what you mean but that would look extremely tacky and I'm not going to do it"  He got really butthurt  but I lacked much empathy for him at that point  " 
True  but they get conflated often   I don't know anything about the person I was responding to  so I encourage them to look into both so they don't get misdirected 
My dad  who was a great dad and whom I still love dearly  did this with cereal  cheese  lunch meat sometimes  He'd cut the good stuff with the cheap stuff   Except on his sandwiches   Eventually it was just us eating the cheap crap  cereal out of a bag etc  and he got the good stuff  "Oh  you can't even tell the difference " YES WE CAN  DAD

Swann's Yellow Bent down the hatch just like that bomb  RIP Uncle Earl and Happy New Year to you brother  
VR in a nutshell gives you a sense of immersion into another world experience while you physically aren't there  They do this by using state of the art technology to track your head body movements  and render the data to display a scaled virtual experience to your head  You basically throw a headset on your head that has a screen for each eye  and headphones for sound  Where you physically turn your head will tell the computer what to display to you  It's so precise that it taps into your instincts  People have even fallen over in VR because they tried to lean against a counter that wasn't actually there  It's an amazing technology that's very expensive  but worth every penny  You can come home after a stressful day and be on a beach  or take a trip to the moon  or ride a roller coaster  
I sat in front of my window waiting for the new year to hopefully be better than the last  Wish me luck

Quad development or full leg development   I see what you're trying to do  but it's not the same  You can't isolate the quads the same way you can isolate the biceps  so the analogy doesn't apply   The fact is you said chin ups are better than curls because you move more weight  Well  if you ONLY want to develop your biceps  curls are better  End of story  Moving more weight doesn't mean you're working a specific body part more than any other exercise if you're recruiting more muscles to do it 
At the NSFW regulatory of course  Where else  xD
Being high isn't an excuse for doing something wrong

I call a battle a sustained fight between organised armed forces  If someone shoots at you and you shoot back that's a firefight  For my deployment the most dangerous I had it was a large riot at night in Dili  capital of Timor   buildings on fire civil unrest etc  they'd try to get us with rocks and darts and shit  Then run away as soon as you look at em  Due to the rules of engagement we didn't fire at people running away  A school girl I knew when I was a kid had been shot at more times then I have been   She was in a night club that got lit up  I wouldn't call her a veteran   But this is just my point of view  I respect everyone's point of view  it's just wording that I choose   BF1 is a great game though

Well new games is good and all  but since the Wii U was a flop Nintendo made some really good games for it to try and make it more popular  Since people haven't bought the Wii U but will buy the Switch  they want to play those great Last Gen games they can't anmore 
I really think that even after "full release" that the game will grow slowly over over the years in quality with updates and content patches much like other MMOs do

Under normal circumstances anyone with your identity information  name ssn date of birth address  can open credit lines in your name   Put in a freeze on your credit prevents anyone from doing so   You have to unfreeze it first before you can use it   It's a security measure for when you suspect someone  like relatives parents  have access to your ID info and you don't know if they will try and use it   Basically it's a preventative measure against identity theft

I remember seeing a thread about slit of little things in GTA V that made me want to buy the game   
The XBox is emulating NES hardware and running the emulation at a set speed  If it ran it at as fast as possible  then it would be several times faster than the original NES game and would be unplayable  I can't speak for Mega Man exactly  but older games tended to run on a cycle locked to the screen refresh which was a fixed 60Hz or 50Hz  There was only one piece of hardware they ran on  so there was no need to adjust for different hardware speeds 
Fuck you  And enjoy your new   LEADER   in the new year  We can't wait to see this debacle unfold     
What happened in here 
Our religious "music" teacher was the best  worst   We would be singing a hymn in assembly and if we  the entire school  half arsed a note she would stop playing the piano and loudly 'perfectly' demonstrate how it   should   be sung   Nothing makes a kid sick of religion like a religious school  As long as their parents don't drive it home   Come to think of it I can't think of how I made my  atheist  Dad feel when he used to read me bedtime stories and I would ask for stories out of the illustrated Bible we had  Luckily we had a SNES and we both bonded a lot more over Donkey Kong Country and Super Mario World 
Oh  Welp  I'm of no use  then

I see two good reasons for it     Making late games less stalling  You know where the last ship is  you can head in its general direction to end the misery     It's an incentive to play more aggressively for cruisers  Battleships won't pick that  sorry destroyer players  but you're often very predictable and often use smoke too aggressively  which is a big clue on where you are   but as a cruiser  you're supposed to hunt these destroyers  and that's one tool to do that     In early game it's not very useful  as there are still too many ships anyway  I'm of course mostly talking about random battles  but there is little point in that in the first 5 minutes  Come on  you all know the general direction of the enemy DDs and it's in front of you  more or less   Good or bad I don't know  but there's a clear purpose to this skill  The fact that you don't like it doesn't make it nonsense  My personal opinion is that it's not much of a game changer  it's way too inaccurate and it's very easy to read it wrong  I do play DDs a bit too and that doesn't look like too much of a big deal except in mid game stages if some RN CL is on me  If anything  DDs will stay a bit closer to their teams instead of going as lone wolves in order to render the tool useless

Nope  they'll all focus on you  because you'll be the biggest threat      Some of those hits will get through   Put another way  If you see half a dozen people attacking you  and one is obviously the most powerful  who do you order your comrades to focus fire on  The weakest one  or the one that's doing the most damage   They'll send one or two sacrifices forward to tie you up in melee while the rest of them stay at range and pincushion you with arrows

This was my insecurity in high school too   I was so self conscious about being flat chested and my thighs not touching  Now that I'm older I just avoid body con stuff  which is OK because that's really not the look I'm going for with my style anyway  
Well that's certainly your prerogative but 99  of the time that's why people ask these questions  They "can't find" anything on it because most people just read the dialogue and most people don't need to ask this type of question  but hey it still manages to come up a lot   
I see even you did not manage to keep count  He gave him back the 9 dollars after she took out 10 dollars for it  She then expected him to give back the 10 dollars or hand over another dollar but then he takes back the 9 dollars and keeps adding to them to he get to 20 which she exchanges for 20 dollars  So in the end she is out 10 dollars

I got an internship offer from a bank that  everyone  was so sure I wouldn't get  not because I'm not smart or anything  but because the people who typically get those internships are from affluent families and go to Ivy Leagues  I was literally just a no name kid from the South with odd jobs on my resume  Took me by surprise 
Never been a huge fan of that sort of argument  The Doom campaign stands on it's own  you could have just released it without multiplayer and it wouldn't feel lacking in any way  And having the multiplayer doesn't take anything away from the campaign  I get informing people not to buy it for multiplayer in the review  but the state of the multiplayer has absolutely zero impact on my enjoyment of the game so it shouldn't impact it's place on game of the year in my opinion 
I've definitely had it happen before  wish I had enough storage space to store  any  videos  Oh  the pain of a solid state drive    
I think the fact he hasn't got a job in the lower leagues by now  no doubt he has seen countless offers  shows he thinks he is above them

Would've and would'ov are easily close enough in pronunciation to think they are the same  especially in quick speech  To transition from would to ve requires a vowel  usually like a light "uh" that sounds almost like an o    Anyway I don't know why I bother because you're arguing semantics about two similar sounding words that is a common misunderstanding and typo  Yes  it's wrong  but it's not a stretch to understand why it happens

My biggest issue was the targeting on large enemies    All I want to do is swing my sword at this giant snake that is literally coiling itself around me  and the game is like "you're targeting the head  can't let you swing your sword then  you're not close enough"   and controlling which part you're targeting is a nightmare   Half the fight against the Adamantoise was me fighting the goddamn targeting scheme more than the giant turtle

As I understood you're purposefully pointed away from your screen when you play  although I don't really see how that translates to the Unity SteamVR asset  which is just a rectangle you drop into your scene without a clear orientation   I have noticed many experiences tend to favor a longer edge as the one you generally look at  so I got my costly stuff at the corner of the shorter edge of my playspace

Having eaten in US  UK  Greek and Spanish Mexican restaurants  I'd say the UK ones are reasonably good  It's hard to tell which one is most authentic as I've never been to Mexico  I'd say the US ones are marginally better  but not enormously so  The ones in Spain and Greece were good too  often with a local twist due availability of ingredients

It's pretty informed speculation  There's little reason for them not to  They had to drop last gen consoles because they weren't powerful enough to handle WotM  and  to repeat your words  look how much the engine still struggles during moments like the siege engine  Considering this  and the recent reports of what Destiny 2 is going to be like  it makes a lot of sense that they'd want to build a new engine

I just tried with the wands  you have like 6 buttons total which really isn't enough for anything more than walk  hit  cast  jump  and use but it was a lot of fun walking through a dunteon with the controllers  Looks great with the new update and the profile scanner it includes that you run after loading into the game  I see potential if we can get gesture support for the vive wands which would free up buttons and potentially allow for a lot of immersion

Reddit crown hype v3  Gofastmen 
They quickly raised invention Xp rates in disassembling augmented gear and lowered the Xp rates from using special components from gizmos greatly  It was a good move  but to have to do this might show that things just weren't tested properly item Xp had to be in read by something like 18 times  They were really off initially   but to now  invention is still quite an empty skill  the item gains no additional benefits after level 12 and there is practically nothing from 99 120   Regarding the nxt client  I haven't seen a word regarding their wanting to fix the crashing issue on macs  It's true that one can turn back to the java client  but it's been quite a while after nxt release  and many of is with macs just feel neglected because we aren't the majority  I'm pretty sure with batch one  one was getting similar rates of chimes by cutting bamboo on Waiko or fishing on whale's maw as one was when going on voyages  so people just went for cutting bamboo or fishing on whale's maw for chimes  until batch 2 came along  making it more desirable to take voyages  The numerical changes could actually have come a lot earlier I'd argue  if they had done some extensive testing and balancing

Mechanics means skill shots  and how is stutter step hard exactly  It's not hard to stutter step it's just taxing  It's not your skill that wins fights it's being more patient  This game isn't street fighter  if you're so mechanically skilled and think that matters then I dare you to kill me standing under my tower or far behind my tank  Should be simple if you're so much better than me  This game is nothing more than waiting and reacting  Having a superior spot that you're standing in than your opponent  It's the Nova brawl  don't reveal yourself first  but react and you win  This game is not difficult to play in the slightest  Everything is point and click  It's patience  and even then it's luck  Pure luck of which team has the less patient players and caves first  Everything you've listed here all are matters of patience and discipline  and have absolutely NOTHing to do with point and click "skill " That is 99  of this game unless you have elephantiasis and mousing over someone and clicking is an Olympic feat   And my last argument that definitively kills the argument of this game being about mechanics is Rich of MVP B  supposedly the BEST "mechanical" player in the world  hating it and quitting the game  That is the ultimate checkmate to people like you that say this game "My skill dick is the biggest therefore I win everytime " If mechanical skill was so important then and did matter so much then WHY would he ever hate this game  Why would he quit  But he's not the only one at the top saying skill isn't important  When Chu  the  1 GM player for quite some time HIMself  said that he considers at least 50 60  of the game to be draft  He said this on townhall heroes a few weeks back  Dunktrain has said most of the game comes down to draft and decisions  not skill as well  This isn't just me being a conspiracy theorist  This game is not so much skill based as it is strategy based  Having a better draft  and better strategic decisions on a macro and micro level  And what's the best micro strategy 100  of the time  Patience  Patience and reacting  Don't act first  Don't stand wide out in the open to cap the tribute first leaving yourself wide open for attack  It's a trap

  With a STEM degree you could try online tutoring  or tutoring from your home      I've tried this quite a lot   The problem is that the market is absolutely flooded with tutors considering there are virtually no barriers to entry   The ratio of work to dollars earned is minuscule for all but a small fraction of people who do this    So     40 hours after the wife gets home and kids are in bed   This is why catering and woodworking are two things that are in my mind   Both are things I can pick up and put down throughout the day as I'm able   Things that require gluing myself to a computer with rigid hours are obviously out    There are lots for software type jobs you can do from home   I've tried looking into these but feel like I'm reading Greek   I'm good with tech but most guides to software jobs I've been finding seem to be either infantile   Here's six hot jobs you can do from home    or written for people already in the field with a degree of programming literacy I don't yet have

little rant here    they had a long beta period which tells me that mythic  should be properly balanced  but now that i have some experience with m   growing every day  i get the impression that m  is actually not properly balanced  this starts to get a real problem because m  is THE alternate endgame progression besides raids  it does start to get repetitive though and i hope blizzard can do something to keep the experience fresh  make the affixes more interesting  maybe alternate mob spawns   continue the rant    some things just don't seem right  take for example big groups of small minions and the bostering affix  i admit that my group may have done something wrong there  i'm just the tank  but we bombed a group of those mana worms in court of stars  one survived somehow and got like 20 stacks of this bolstering stuff and became an end boss  that doesn't seem right  there needs to be like a grace period in which you can kill mobs before the buff applies or it should only apply to elite mobs  but even then there are some groups that are pretty hefty with this affix  a lot more hefty than some other affixes   skitting or whatever it is called isn't so much fun either  again  i'm a tank and the random behavior of mobs isn't fun for me  maybe i lack experience there  maybe it's not random but i build aggro a lot less effective  if that's the case i can work around that  i can not work around randomness though   the timer is m 's essence but it's not all good  in fact  i think it would be better to get rid of the timer  this aspect creates a very antisocial environment  people get salty extremely quickly  when you wipe  you can basically forget a 3 chest  bad affixes in the wrong dungeon  forget 3 chests  one player leaves  hah  forget the run  admittedly this only happened two times for me but there were two players that ruined the experience of two groups  that's extremely frustrating   personally i would totally get rid of the timed aspect  make the dungeons tough but give infinite time  let people communicate  let there be social interaction  you can't talk in a timed run  that's counter productive  people who chat do less dps  increasing the timer  decreasing rewards  increasing salt levels   i'd get rid of timers altogether  not even have a separate thing like the old challenge mode  it would force people into it because of rewards anyways  it would defeat the purpose of removing the time aspect in the first place    end rant

You were looking in the mirror I see 
Most of the time it's better to double click  Reasons     You make sure all your shells go out at the perfect time to shoot    Since all your shells all come out instantly  you can immediately start looking around  which helps you keep on top of the tactical situation and dodge enemy fire    If you are in smoke  double clicking makes you harder to track than firing sequentially    If the target is not paying attention to you  they will have less time to react to your first volley    Arguably a little harder for the target to dodge even if they are paying attention to you    Killing your opponent a second or two earlier may prevent them from getting off a last shot   However  there are some situations where you may want to do otherwise     If you really don't know where to shoot  a ranging shot can help you get more information    If you need to shoot as soon as possible  you are about to die  target is about to go behind an island smoke your traverse   holding down the mouse will remove the delay between the reload finishing and you clicking the mouse    Likewise  if your ship has rapid fire guns and you are trying to wear down a non maneuvering target  holding down the mouse will maximize your sustained rate of fire since there is no delay between the reload finishing and you clicking the mouse    If you don't think you will need every shell to finish off your target you might keep the rest for another target  but beware RNG  
This is so extremely sad and disturbing  my thoughts are with everyone in Turkey  They always have to pick soft targets because in the end they remain the greatest cowards on earth 
Oh my god you're right   
I actually think in terms of combat the game was one step forward two steps back for the series  It was more open and the stealth more fleshed out but there was practically no enemy variety  the open areas led to them having little in diverse combat scenarios that funneled you into creative unique spots  and what weapons I had felt more meaningless    There might be aspects of the combat that are better but overall as a whole it is definitely worse and perhaps the least I've enjoyed combat in a naughty dog game since Uncharted 1

We might be looking at this as Civ players on the Civ subreddit and are over estimating our reach     Juggernaut beat Wisp  reddit favorite  in the Valve Dota 2 Arcana vote  https   www reddit com r DotA2 comments 4xl8xv juggernaut won the arcana vote    It's a popularity contest and it often goes to the  most played hero  https   www dotabuff com heroes played   Support players on reddit  who are in the minority and colluded with trolls to influence the vote and a consensus was reached to try and push  Wisp IO  https   www dotabuff com heroes io  to the top of the vote  The trolls were on board because Valve has neither item or arcana support built for the hero  so they would have to do a lot of work   However the Dota reddit has  200k subs while there are  12m active Dota players  not sure what   voted     When Wisp was knocked out there were tongue in cheek cries that the vote was rigged  From reddit's point of view they had won and had not considered the large unwashed masses who treated the vote as a popularity contest  not a serious vote  Wisp was only played in 2  of games compared to the popularity of Jug at  21     Civ is the right answer for this question    but this was never about picking the right answer  it was about tribalism and your favorite game  The Skyrim and CSGO tribes are bigger and far more aggressive it seems

  For most people the security of their reddit account isn't a big deal   It is when it's the same password or patterns as other more important accounts  Also  a previously unimportant account could become important tomorrow  When that change happens do you think the user will bother to change his password  Probably not   That's why it needs to be forced  People are bad at judging how important their data is  Especially since the data within an online account constantly changes and is beyond the average user's ability to control    People don't start out as mods  They start out as regular users just messing around on Reddit 
I have noticed that it hasn't happened in the last few days unless I'm running a bunch of different programs at once  Which might be acceptable since it's under a heavy load  Before it would randomly happen    Also  my battery has almost doubled since then  So I'm not sure if it's fixed  if I haven't triggered it again  or if it worked itself out after a few days    I'll try to update if I notice anything else happening  but unfortunately I don't really know  
Nope  As for the why  GGG prefers to keep these things hidden for a couple reasons  One  is that people become WAY too fixated on "big numbers"  And with how many times you can hit or tic damage in POE  it'd be screen clutter galore  It'd distract and likely make it even harder to see what's actually happening  GGG would rather have you  feel  how combat is by how long it takes to kill enemies  stuns  etc  The other reason is that published numbers are WAY easier to game  Like if you know that a certain mob or boss has X hp  you know exactly how much you need to deal or how many hits and starting building planning around that  Again  the focus move away from the feeling of combat and the focus is transferred to these numbers  POE is already pretty heavy on the spreadsheets  Path of Excel  on the planning side  it doesn't need it on the gameplay side too

As someone firmly planted in silver over prioritization of camps is the big one that kills me   People treat camps like the main objective and prioritize it over pushing a structure down   No matter how much you plea or ping  they will always split up to do camps once the enemy is wiped   What is worse is they don't even bother clearing the lanes to move them along  they just cap it and leave it   The enemy spawns  clears the camps  that have done zero siege   then they gank one or two people attempting to invade a camp close to their base   I have become numb to being called a noob for wanting to push instead

Wild Hunt would be epic 
How about they announce the "10 anniversary"  no way it'll be called that or even mentioned  at WWDC in early June and launch it the same day as the original iPhone on June 29th  Probably extremely unlikely though  especially if they'll have new a MacPro at WWDC  
Nice catch  Love the idea nevertheless  
What   WoT looks amazing on console and runs fine   Pretty sure ships is  less  graphically intensive than tanks   It would run fine   That being said I don't have any idea if they intend to make a console version

I think it'll probably come down to gameplay balancing  I'm speculating  but my suspicion is that making it run at a variety of framerates will be harder to support  and particularly considering the low gameplay tickrate will feel very odd  particularly in PvP    144Hz Destiny 2 would be amazing  though 
And that sentiment  which involves race as a unifying and exclusionary force  is fucking racist

Find your enemy's weak spot physically and hone in on that  I mean  Think like bond  You're having a conversation with someone and you've already figured out 3 ways to kill them if you have to   My best advice is to avoid conflict if you can  Figuring out subtly whether a potential person you may fight with regularly skips leg day and is heavily dominant on the right side or has a longer torso that can't be blocked or shielded completely  Longer hair  This is why many fighters warriors keep their hair short  Just make subtle observations about them  If the situation escalates be sure that you're in control  Normally a palm to the nose at an upward angle can solve many problems and disable your attacker   Be aware of your vulnerabilities too  Take great care to protect them

Don't worry it's always the same people  Military ranks always have a high concentration of younger people  10 20 years ago generation "x"  filled the military and food industry  10 15 years before that it was the previous generation  And so on  The food industry is easy to break into with little experience so it attracts  younger people  The same is true for the military  Plus a majority of people stay discharged after their 4 or 5 year contract is over and don't re enlist  The military won't let you join if you're over a certain age so unless you stay enlisted  the ranks are usually younger people  This news article will be recycled for every subsequent generation  It's not news  more of a fundamental law  like gravity  or the recipe for the colonel's chicken 
That doesnt really disprove my point  Gwent's just a side activity you can do if you like card games  It's great that they made a standalone game out of it  but it's not as important for witcher as minigames are for grand theft auto  Between the two i thing GTA definately deserves that award

Which is true but do you think all that matters to OP  I doubt the durability is much of a concern  Nobody I know shoots a steady diet of hot  357  Sitting here staring at the 2 The Security Six is barely if any smaller than the GP  It's the underlug that makes the difference what OP wants is value  
The turn based combat has a few quirks to keep it interesting  it wasn't too grindy if memory serves    The narrative is pretty good  not the best ever but more than sufficient to support the length of the game  The real draw for me were the lost memories  short memory sequences triggered by the environment  They were text over a static image with some sound effects  very simple but very well written

One way to think about it is that multiplying by a negative "reverses" the direction of something  If you picture numbers as arrows on a number line going from 0 to their number  i e   6 is an arrow starting from 0 going right to 6   5 is an arrow starting from 0 going left to  5   then multiplying by a negative reverses the direction of the arrow   1   6    6  flipping the arrow around   1    6 does the same thing  it takes the  6 arrow and flips it around to positive 6

That's unfortunate   They more or less mismanaged one of their most valuable assets for a quick buck   Those saying  "maybe she only had one fight left in her"  I'd argue she didn't approach this fight like someone who planned to win and retire   At this stage though I think that you'd be lucky to get interest in a Ronda Rousey vs  Miesha Tate contest except for the nostalgia of it

I don't get a lot of podcast time  My commute to work is only about 30 minutes  and I work in a call center  so I can't really listen to things there  it's easier to watch it at home  And besides  seeing the miniatures and all the presents they get sent are worth it   I would have felt very disappointed if I'd listened to the skyship episode

To be honest  a good amount of Muslims condemn fellow Muslims for becoming "westernized"  actually they call them infidel  not muslims  Also those muslims are pretty ok with enslaving Yazidi women   Can't solve the radical islamist problem without understanding the manpower resource

Previously I've floated the idea of having two preselected basics in the command zone  and met the same reaction  Which would still change lots of things about the game  splashing an extra color would trivial  And that's fine  Plenty of cards become obsolete every year  hundreds if we're talking about draft  that's one of the features of the game and it would complicate around the new ruling        I think draft in particular would be a better experience if players could get the basic functions of their deck to work more consistently  You wouldn't want as much shuffling as you'd need if you searched your deck every turn  but there's absolutely nothing wrong with both players getting live draws every turn  That's a better game that's still completely Magic

This straight up sucks but I feel like aside from addressing the useless guy who took advantage of you we should also look at opportunities to grow    1  be more prepared   craft some warmer clothes  It makes no sense to be in the dz and not be at a warmth level to sustain your play  2  Just walk away   you didn't need to kill the hunters  you could extract somewhere else  You already killed yours with plenty of time on the clock  This was your biggest mistake  Let players fight their own and die  you played your whole session for you  not them  Go extract    3  don't get overzealous   although killing hunters feels good  I've killed 5 in a session from similar situations  if you die to this desire  you can't really be mad at anyone else  If the other player died you'd still be mad he showed up and didn't help  See no  2   extract somewhere else    I'm jaded though  Played since launch and made it through all patches  all the shitty times and I've learned to trust no one  
Enjoy it friend 
  Refusal to back out of a decision  I can't even count the number of times I've attempted to ping type people into abandoning a camp only to see them remain there and force us to stall an objective 4v5 or immediately get ganked by an enemy that was obviously approaching   This is by far the most frustrating thing and what I would consider to be "MRR Hell"  No matter how much you work on mana conservation or improving mechanical skills  you can't win games if your team loves to go one by one to the objective and proceed to die 10 seconds apart from each other  
How can you not like it  it's an epic masterpiece  Fuck off back to call of duty then  
What you said is pefect and nice but is not part of DEs core philosophy  Their approach is rather the MMO expansion way in slapping a new treadmill to get players to play  The entire core of the game is not built for intellectual playloops like that
  Four  there's no deathmatch  There needs to be a deathmatch  3v3 is the best game mode IMO and I'm kinda sure there's only one map for it   There is only one map  Ecopoint  Antarctica   However  originally they swore there would never be 3v3  1v1  or any other game mode besides 6v6  but after community demand they changed their minds and put one out 5 6 months after the game released  That's a pretty quick response to their fans  considering how long it takes to design and create the map  the matchmaking algorithm  etc

I don't think you understand what a contract is   It's not a fixed term contract  It is a month to month contract   A contract is a legal agreement between two parties  The CRTC is referring to mobile contracts  Whether you're paying from month to month  or fixed in for any length of time  you are still entering a contract  The same is true if you hire a plumber and make an agreement for service  or just about anything else  It's a contract   I was asking for advice here  not arguments where I have to explain basic principles

 I'm proud of the fact we've not given into the fear mongers trying to divide people throughout the western world   I find your comments funny   You denounce patriotism yet you're a civic nationalist  the epitome of patriotism  Not only that but you also denounce having fear mongers "divide people" when your multicultural beliefs of inviting people into Canada with radically different beliefs is seriously dividing Canadians   "Oh yeah  I'm sure bringing in people who subjugate woman is going to unite Canadians around the country "  s  What a joke

I just wanted to let you know I just ran this puzzle   The party was in a cavern that opened up to a narrow path surrounded by lava where a "bulldozer" machine was poised to push them off to their deaths   There was a cabinet and it had "or die" carved into it with 5 books strewn about  Using the bookmark  they were hinted that the books had to be put in order   In addition each book had two numbers written in the front  e g  255  1 or 160  6  representing a page and a word on that page   If they arranged the books in order and got the 5 words needed  the first letter of each word would spell out "LAUGH"   and as long as they laughed at the monster  it wouldn't charge them and kill them   Took my party 20 minutes and 3 hints to get to the end  Thanks for the idea

  The industry may not want you but since when did you want to become a comic book creator to get kudos from other comic book creators       It isn't about kudos    it is about being able to work civilly with people who would be your coworkers  colleagues  mentors etc  Outcasts   untouchables tend to have poor career opportunities          u tekende  honestly though  don't necessarily give up on your dreams  You could always try to hack it as an indie or something  It's not like the comics industry doesn't have a rich history of folks going their own damn way

For FRep  I'd just record yourself clicking the buttons  Entrance  Missions  Select Companion  Depart  Auto  then Next Next Next at the Results screen  If you select play with repeat recording X times  where X is  say 80  it will just play that recording 80 times  That's literally the most basic you can make it  It won't account for connection loss though   If you want to account for connection loss then you should turn wifi data off  screenshot the connection loss screen  go back into FRep  press create new sequence  add the recording you just made and then press add control  scroll down to image  select the screenshot  then move the rectangle over to the next button by pressing edit image  set Match Pixels Rate  80   0  will probably do tbh    Trials  5 0 sec  5 seconds should be enough   Set  On Sucess   Next Fail Timeout    Next  This should add a 5 second period after your recording each time to check if the connection loss screen shows up  Finally  you should make it loop like 100 times   I'm a complete macro noob so that's how I  would  do it   Purposely saying "would" in case macros become bannable   then I haven't publicly admitted to macroing

The car is his until the title passes to you     You need to get it home   Call your insurance up and ask them what happens hypothetically if you borrow someone elses car and there's some mishap   I'm assuming you have insurance   Since this is a private sale with someone you know  you might be able to swap paper  you  the check  he  the title   After  you get it home  and return the plates to him 
       Except that the same number of barriers will still exist because the zones   are   bounded

So not the same car  but another Pontiac  the solstice I owned misfired a lot under stress and it threw the same code  I believe across all 2006 Pontiac models  they used incredibly cheap cats that failed hard and early causing misfires  terrible fuel economy  and a huge hit to acceleration    Does your car sound like it has a modified intake  That was sign number one of the bad cats  It made a sound that reminded me of a noisier intake  Has fuel economy 9my really taken a hit  After replacing the cats I went from 20mpg average to 29 average    I know that this might not help you   but it is my experience with a 2006 Pontiac solstice  Luckily for me gm recognized how bad the cats were and extended the warranty by leaps and bounds     Edit  I also switched to premium for a month and the problem became less noticeable  You could try that to see how it fares

Yes  you can macro on a tablet for tm farming   No  you will not be banned if you are using a macro to tm farm   You WILL be banned if you do anything to change the state of the game   TM Farming with a macro is  not  changing the state of the game 
It isn't discrimination based on the race or sex of Trump  it is discrimination of him based on him being an asshat     White is still a race  and straight is still an orientation that are protected   I would fight the same fight if a white person were being discriminated because they are white  or a straight person couldn't get someone to bake them a cake because they were straight     I think there has been a misunderstanding of what I was trying to get across   Probably my poor writing skills

If they perfectly replicate the Wiimote's functionality with the joycons there can definitely be support for Wii VC   From a technical standpoint  Wii emulation isn't much more demanding than GameCube emulation  so both should be possible with the Switch

Finally  Can't wait to jailbreak my 4s  
It's been a thought of mine lately that NPCs and NPC factions of some kind are possibly needed in the multiplayer survival genre  Just some semblance of order within the chaos to direct players  provide a small zone that trade can be constantly maintained  guard patrols  etc   This is generally inspired by EVE's High Sec  Low Sec  and Null Sec though for the genre I think High Sec wouldn't exist   I'd like for players to be able to raid  though not necessarily conquer  the safe space if they can amass the resources and players to do it   
GL and BotD are nothing like eachother honestly  BotD has far more in common with Enochian than GL as GL has almost no impact on your rotation other than your opener

Did we read the same article  It was all about poppers  I mean it was a stupid article but it was clearly about poppers 
The thing I'm seeing most people state  not just in this thread  is that it "will be better when connected to V5"   Or "better when you can binge"  Here's the problem with this  1  If this Volume has to lean on an  entire other volume  that we haven't seen yet and for all we know could be better or worse  in order to be good  then it's  well  not good at all   2  The writers are still the ones to divide up the episodes and decide where the cut offs are  The fact that the episodes themselves are paced poorly in the context of what they start and end on  Is a symptom of the same overall problem  And further proof that they have trouble with pacing 
Wait until you find a treasure map with something like a drawing of a tower near a river  and try to determine where it is   There's 10 normally in the world  and a few you can get during different side quests 
You just explained how it's risk reward though  In case you didn't catch it   And it's definitely optional

I am sorry  You love each other but won't see eye to eye anytime soon  The question is what your relationship will look like going forward  Do you think you can both find a way to develop a healthy relationship despite this disagreement  
It is meant for damage though  rewarding timing and skill for higher damage  The knockback was there to compensate for the lack of damage it did at close range  When it released it even had a 50  damage bonus  before double donks were an offical thing it could 1 shot pyros and demos with perfectly timed shots  And before its recent got nerf it did 141 damage on double donks  it had a higher damage output overall than stock  It can still 1 shot light classes  but they have to be at close range  It was always meant for damage until Valve decided it did a bit too much   The idea is to reward the player for timing the cannonballs  As of now  there's barely any reward for timing it  defeating the purpose of the weapon   Making the projectile speed actually work correctly helps make the weapon more usable than buff it really   
Are the century ones junk  though  Just curious  probably gonna go with the ptr

Finish the video and let me know what you think  Personally I think some of the responses of those on the alt right about homosexuality have not been based in fact and have been very feels based  Mostly it's been just saying homosexuals are degenerate  which many of them are but not du to their homosexuality  and unnatural   While scientific studies on the origins of homosexuality leave a lot to be desired  there are promising indications that there are a few possible evolutionary benefits to homosexuality   increased fecundity in the maternal female relatives  http   journals plos org plosone article id 10 1371 journal pone 0051088    better caregivers to children  http   www psychologicalscience org media releases 2010 vasey cfm    social bonding  http   uopnews port ac uk 2014 11 25 homosexuality may help us bond   among them   I think on the whole there is more reason to embrace normally functioning homosexuality than to reject it

Fallout 4 has 6 or 7 pieces of DLC  Unless you aren't counting some of the DLC as DLC for some arbitrary reason    Skyrim has Hearthstone  Hearthfire    the one with the vampires and the one that sorta takes place in Morrowind    Oblivion had shivering isles  the nines and then  of course  horse armor    Not a shit ton per se  but certainly not only 2

To be clear  the creditors will quite likely contact you asking you to pay but unless you agree to do so  you don't owe them anything  
Other than The Last of Us I can't think of a game that swept as heavily as Overwatch has without being part of or derived from an existing franchise  Witcher III  Rocket League  Bloodborne  etc all huge but also all successors

Hang onto it either way in case they buff Blastoise  I really think they should and eventually will 
Genuine comment here and I am not being insensitive so please don't take it that way   You can use written speech pretty well  I have no trouble understanding you  but I don't know how fast your typing is or how difficult it is for you to do so  as I only see the end result    Can you possibly bring a computer or any other form of text to speech device    Obviously it shouldn't be needed as long as your attorney shows up but it'd be a possible back up option 
On the internet  you could call a 120 year old a kid  Let alone Reddit 
Craftycarnivalzombie do you get the feeling that the attorney was trying to take advantage of the OP   It just has a snake feeling to me  
I can't believe it either  man

Fair enough and fully respect that  I plan on going support next league myself  but can usually coordinate with my friend whose build is built around a support  Though for leveling we often play at our own leisure and do it solo  maybe Skyping if both playing but at different points in game

Monk refresh  8 seconds  DRG refresh  1 second   At this point it's clear you just don't know how DRG works  that's fine  Go make a poll or something  monk is universally accepted as being the easiest job to play  There is a reason why top tier players never talk about how hard GL3 is to keep up  because implying they have trouble keeping up the easiest stack in the game is embarassing  lol  You only lose GL3 in raid fights right now outside of extended boss jump aways if you suck  that's really all there is to it  
The new scanner that you run after launching the game dials in the positional rotstion and fov settings somehoe and makes it look great for skyrim and fallout 4  going to hop off and try some other games for science  Using the vive wands as controllers makes it great if you just want to explore  the limitation on buttons makez it hard to play j less you have a proper controller

That's all fine and well  but the guilt trip only works on me if I believe that ever hand that's digging into my pocket is asking for fair compensation and no more  Of course there are reasonable costs  Rent  insurance  hydro  wages  food isn't really a legitimate fee to add to the ticket because I pay for that food at the concession counter   But there are a lot of costs   particularly by distributors and studios   which are grossly and shamefully inflated  and a lot of those fees are dumped unfairly on the shoulders of the cinema itself  forcing them to collect it from the customer  And that's not even taking into account any gouging that the theater itself is guilty of  Popcorn is literally marked up 1000  at the counter  I'm not exactly wiping tears away on their behalf   I'm fine with ticket prices covering expenses and offering a fair and reasonable profit over and above that  But it's pretty naive to claim that's all I'm asked to pay for
