Yeah it happens  I'm free to talk here or PM   Gotta keep your head up  don't think about it find something to keep you busy
I definitely have  I think back to when I was a kid and using the urinal  When I was a kid I'd just whip that shit out and start pissin  it didn't matter if there were 40 other dudes in there  it'd  flow like water  Nowadays I have to do breathing exercises to calm myself down if there is anyone in the bathroom

I don't blame women at all  Honestly if anyone ever did date me for some crazy reason  i'd just feel really sorry for them 
Same experiences  Same situation  my friend  Never experienced a romantic relationship with a girl  Now here at age 18  I have severe anxiety and it's hard to get out of my comfort zone but I know that comfort isn't right for me  That's the truth for people who have anxiety depression  By all means  you  myself in included  need to escape and find those who will let us in their lives  You may not know how to love yourself but remember that you know how to love others 
I jusst did it 
JK Rowling made a very nice Christmas tweet that really helped me   In part it reads  "Ive also heard from people who are going through very tough times  These always seem worse at Christmas   At this time of year  were bombarded with images of perfect lives  which bear as little relation to reality as tinsel does to gold   If youre lucky enough to be with the people you love  warm and safe  with enough to eat  Im sure you feel as blessed as I do   But if your life is currently full of difficulties  if you arent where you want to be  either literally or figuratively  remember that extraordinary transformations are possible  Everything changes  Nothing is forever   Thinking back to my worst Christmas  I found it hard to believe that my unhappiness would pass  I was truly afraid of the future   You never know what the future holds  Astonishing reversals of fortune happen every minute   So if youre sad  or lonely  or bereaved  or ill  separated from your loved ones or in any other way suffering this Christmas  I send you love and wish you luck and better times  Millions of us have been where you are now   Remember  Christmas Day is  in the end  just a day  It isnt a test or a scorecard of you or your life  so be kind to yourself "  That last one is really the heart of it all   To reiterate to today  New Years Eve is  in the end  just a day  It isnt a test or a scorecard of you or your life  so be kind to yourself   I spent many many years doing nothing  making false promises  and seeing nothing come of them   Even today it's really easy to get stuck in a mire of "I'm still overweight  I don't have a girlfriend  this year was wasted" but it's very hard to pause and go "I started gaming with friends every week  I started some D D with reddit strangers that goes every week  I took 3 trips for myself  I spent a lot of money just on myself to make me happy"   I guarantee you that there's a lot you did for yourself this year to take heart in outside of the two big goals of being fit and getting a girlfriend 
While you're at it  fuck 2018 and 2019  heck  fuck all the way to 2099  No need for more years  Fuck 'm all 
TV series  Find something out there you like  with at least three seasons  and you're gonna love it 
For me Cymbalta worked really well for anxiety   also had you noticed in the post  i'm not addicted to opoids  Like I said  I tried them one time  the second time  I was going to but got rid of them instead    As far as the alcoholism goes  I've had to quit cold turkey for a couple months at a time at points  when suppliers moved away and such  I never had withdrawels and within the five days since my last drink  none have occurred  And this drinking was literally so bad  for some one my age I guess  but bad for anybody I assume  That I would drink and then make myself throw up just so I could drink more  This didn't happen often  I have not had any withdrawals of alcohol ever    And I'm not on prozac  but what did you mean by withdrawals from that  Or Cymbalta or whatever    What is Cymblata  is this something I should talk about with my doctor   Xanax  of course on the lowest dosage so far  has had no noticeable affects in my mood  Maybe it helps anxiety and I just don't realize it or something    And what is suboxone     NALTREXONE and SUBOXONE are medications to keep you from doing drugs and drinking    SUBOXONE is an opioid that blocks the effects of any other opioids  It's also sometimes prescribed for pain  I'm thinking if you have pain issues it may not be a good idea    Naltrexone is for addiction ss well but I take it to help with the night eating I get from my antidepressants     Xanax for anxiety is going to flatten your personality out and they also need to be increased constantly because its short acting  Maybe consider Klonopin which is better suited for someone who doesnt want to pop pills all day  I've had them all and stopped because they are the worst to come off of   For anxiety I had great luck with Cymbalta but everyone is different  For anxiety I found the Beta blockers work best  A low dose of Inderall helps a lot   You have a dangerous alcohol problem  The binging and purging thing is interesting  While I don't believe in addiction I do think your drinking is a symptom of some sort of personality disorder   As a safety net try naltrexone for a month so you can get ahead of the drinking and focus on what the problem is  You could have ADHD for all I know  Symptoms range from a total disregard for your health to getting hyperfocused on substances  Sucks about the shots    
Good for you mate  Have fun  
IRL  I have met many wonderful people and a few that were complete sociopaths  The issue is that sociopaths are like black holes  everyone gravitates towards them and nobody can escape their grasp  Most social circles have one at their core  not unlike most galaxies   It's not that good people don't use the internet  Most everyone on the internet is faceless  It's hard to feel shame when one knows that they are anonymous  It's even harder to feel empathy for someone who is anonymous  A certain awareness is required to step back and realize that everybody that one interacts with on the internet is a living  breathing human being

You cant save her  She is also already in an relationship  Even if she does get away  its best to be in therapy for at least a year before beginning another relationship  She has to save herself  No one is coming to do it for her  She had an opportunity to have him removed when the cops were there  and chose not to  Thats not uncommon  but it shows she isnt ready to leave yet  It can take years for that to happen  You cant be more invested in her then she is in herself  I recommend you check out thehotline org and look for the resources for Family and Friends  And be very careful  
Jup  I hate it because I've become rather good at getting the few daily attacks i get to go away by breathing slowly and thinking "it's only anxiety  nothing bad is happening"    But in the middle of the night  you cannot always think rationally for the first few minutes when you wake up  so here the pounding heart or offset reality feeling of anxiety still can get it's claws in me    And then the "downward spiral thinking" of how my day at work is gonna suck because of lack of sleep pretty much ensures that I will not get any more sleep   Aaahhh  The joys of anxiety  I'm hoping 2017 will treat me better anxiety wise

Id say Headspace or Calm
I get that this is a depression subreddit but maybe we shouldn't encourage others to "resign" from life
Totally   We get into this weird "Got to take stock of my entire life and how the last year went"   I got a lot of help from a tweet by JK Rowling that ended with  "Remember  Christmas Day is  in the end  just a day  It isnt a test or a scorecard of you or your life  so be kind to yourself" http   imgur com gallery GJTSn  It's probably more depression  but part of SA leads to us sitting around contemplating things and planning stuff way too much   Try to have a good day just like any other   
it is a special kind of headache 
Stimulant overdoses are usually painful as fuck    I'd recommend you get to an ER or call an emergency service asap it's really not a fun way to go   
If it's any consolation to you I went to bed early on NYE  In fact the holidays seem to have passed me by with the only noteworthy event being my virulent head cold 
God  it's the worst  Especially if you're like me and are prone to constantly worry about your health  I've gotten better about it but the thought is always in the back of your head that it could be something more serious like ALS or Parkinson's  Of course I know it's rare as shit but that's just another example of my own irrational fears   I've been dealing with a twitch in my left eye for like 2 weeks and it flares up when I get nervous  It's starting to ease up though so thank god for that  Hopefully our twitches will disappear for the new year and we can celebrate 
I have a somewhat long story that I posted last night in a different forum  It is anxiety related  so I figured it wouldn't hurt to share it here as well  I am new to Reddit and this thread so I look forward to looking through it and finding some stories and talking to some people who I can relate to about anxiety  Happy New Year   I just had a pretty crazy 4 hours and I wanted to share it   Basically I had a breakdownand then a breakthrough   The backstory is my life  but I will try to keep it as short as I can so hopefully people read this  I have never posted something so personal  but if even one person gets something from it  I will consider it worth it   Right now  it is 9 pm on 12 30 16 and if this is not the best thing that has happened to me in 2016  tomorrow is going to be amazing  Technically the last part of it happened about an hour ago and I just decide to write about it  It began at 4 when I was dragging my ass out of a funk and trying to take it to yoga   Rewinding a little bit  I just arrived home on Wednesday night  today is Friday  from going home to MD for Xmas  Long story short  my parents had a bitter divorce over 20 years ago and still cant be in the same room so Xmas usually sucks  I wasnt going to go home but based on some realizations in prior months  I decided I wanted to go home not for Xmas  but to talk to my parents about how their resentment towards one another affected me  I could go on and on with examples of ways they have hurt one another and I probably will write a longer edition because it seems therapeutic  but thats not for now   I convinced my parents to meet and so I went home for the holidays for that  I was contemplating not going up until the last minute and cancelled my uber to the airport twice  My anxiety has been reduced for much of the year but started to get very bad when I began making plans to ask my parents to do this  Lets just say it wasnt easy  It took a lot of emotion out of me having to come up with 17 different ways to tell each of them how this affected me  what bothers me and ultimately to agree to it  By the time it came around  I was having such a tough time  I told myself I needed to power through it and at least try  so I went  We talked about how their relationship is unhealthy for my family  I told them that they are the parents and need to set a better example  They ended their relationship with each other and thats fine  but to still hold so much animosity so many years later has affected their relationship with me and my siblings  Even during this conversation they couldnt help but bring up the past and blame one another for how things are today  Again  this is only the abbreviated version  but basically they just point the finger at one another   Another key part of this story is  how  I feel  they handled having a gay child  Growing up  I was bullied a lot for being gay  I wasnt out   This has had a huge factor on my life struggle with anxiety  I never talked about it growing up for fear it would destroy my family  but I found out more recently they knew of it  Growing up in their silence and lack of any type of positive discussion or comments on the topic of anything gay made me feel like I just could not be  I came out at 26 and am now 33  When I came out they said it was ok  but I still sometimes wonder  They still just ignore it  but I have realized thats just how they handle things  This was also the first time I have ever had the opportunity to ask them both at the same time why if they both say they knew I was gay  they didnt talk to me as a child  I have asked them individually  but they usually blame the other  I still dont feel like I got a good answer  but I think I got an honest answer  which I greatly appreciated  Overall  there were some obstacles in the conversation  but at the time it seemed it was a step in the right direction   However  more drama happened after and since I have come back and had time to register it all  plus taking into account other things that I am leaving out  I have felt this sense of doom that nothing will change and I might have to just cut off ties with my family  This might sound extreme  but there is more to it  My anxiety until about an hour ago has been at a lifetime high since I left to come home  It is impacting me in ways that effect my livelihood  I have been doing hot yoga for almost 2 years  It has done wonders for me and my whole mind  body  spirit mindset  I am kind of obsessed   Well  I rushed to class and made it just in time  I got in and immediately started sweating like a pig  When I first started this happened a lot and to the point of it making me self conscious  but I came to appreciate that because I think I am literally sweating anxiety out  This was some next level shit though and the fact that it was happening this way so quickly made me realize it was going to be a long class   Well  it wasnt because it got so bad  I couldnt do it  They tell you when you start that you should never leave class  just lay down and make it through  I always did this  even in the beginning  but by the 30th minute  I was out    the door  Another interesting side note on this is that I was late to class and the only spot was right near the door  I think if I were in my normal spot on the floor  opposite end of the door   I never would have done this   I bolted out without my stuff  went to the locker room and just hung my head in my towel and tried to make sense of what the fuck was happening to me  Since I left my stuff and was not going to go back in to get it during class  I just took a shower and then went out to wait for the class to finish   As I was waiting  feeling pretty guilty for leaving  people began coming in for the next class  As I mentioned before when you are new  they give you the overview and the most important thing is just dont leave  Well  there were a few 1st timers tonight  Also  the teacher for the next class was one of my favorite instructors so as she is telling people this  in my head I am just saying god damnit  this is the one thing that I want to do and I cant even get through an hour because I am so jammed up with this family shit  I started to chat with the instructor and some of the other people working and they asked me how my holiday was  I said it was a little stressful but tried to keep it at that  Once I got caught that I left class though  I think they were like  oh shit  he isnt joking  Class finished and I did my walk of shame in to grab my stuff  I apologized to the instructor who was along with everyone else was so supportive  One of them even gave me a hug   As I began walking to my car  I started to get emotional  Mind you  I am kind of an ice queen  so this is odd   By the time I got to the car  I was in full on bawling  for me  mode   My friend and I had talked about meeting up earlier in the day  but I was feeling so anxious all day that I said I wanted to try to go to class and see how I felt after  I told her what happened and just vented about my Xmas trip  She and I used to be roommates so she gets my family stuff and we definitely relate to each other with family issues so its good we were talking earlier in the day  Otherwise I might have just kept it in  I told her I probably didnt want to go out but was going to eat and see how I felt  She was going to the gym so she said she would text me after  Taking it out helped me to really lay out in my head how crazy it all is and how its slowly eating me alive  After more tears and some long talks with myself I realized that Fuck them  I have told myself in the past  but this time I feel like I believe it  I realized that my whole life I have gone out of my way to try to accommodate them  Whether it was trying to convince myself I wasnt gay for fear of what they would think  acting as if everything is hunky dory when I go home or even just going home since I have probably done that over 40 times for the last 13 years  During that same time  my 5 members of my family combined have visited me a total of 6 times  and I have lived in some pretty amazing places   Anyways  all these thoughts went through my mind  I also came to the realization that I have  at times  allowed them to make me feel ashamed for being gay  Im not saying its their fault and I wouldnt even think this was intentional  but they have  This is due to other factors  such as politics  but the pain has always been there and I just uncovered that   Once I realized this  I feel like everything I felt before just kinda washed away  I realized that allowing these things to stress me out has only gotten in my own way  Not just with accepting myself  but in every other way that this anxiety has tormented me  relationships  socially  physically    Going from such a bad place to how I feel now in such a short time is crazy  I feel like I just let a huge weight off my shoulders  I'm looking very forward to putting this new attitude to work in 2017

I do desperately try to speak to her and get ahold of her but otherwise I'm not like your ex  I love her  I really do  It just breaks my heart to be without her  I can't move on and I won't move on

Thanks i appreciate you sharing your experience  It is really hard on me but at the same time based on his behavior it does seem like he is genuinely suicidal  He called me from work and told me he was going to just go leave and kill himself  He said he was just calling me so I could tell his family he was sorry  When I asked him how he planned on doing it he said he wouldn't tell me because he didn't want me to try to stop him  I begged him to let me pick him up from work so I could take care of him  I feel like an awful person because for a brief moment I felt like I should have just ignored him and let him do it if he really wanted to  But if i don't stop him then I will feel responsible  
  be successful  This is the key  I struggle with it myself  I don't want to be successful  I HAVE to be successful   But what is success  Try to ask yourself what YOU want  what are YOUR goals  What if nobody was judging  if anything was possible  Whats your personal success gonna be   You are adequate  You are worth it  I like you just the way you are 
This happens to me  too  Whenever a close friend tells me about their own problems and anxieties  I'm always really anxious for them and I try to resolve it by giving gentle advice and suggesting plans of action  I'm the dad friend  complete with bad puns and all   You're not mental at all  trust me  and it might actually be hyperempathy  I've heard it's not all that uncommon for anxiety sufferers   
Goodnight
I'm absolutely lovesick and heartbroken  
Well in all fairness  I think this year has blown so many buttholes for all of us  I think personally my anxiety was the most extreme it has been in my entire life because of just all the craziness that has come with 2016  I'm sure things will be better in 2017  I remain super optimistic 
Thank you  and thank you for taking the time to share your personal experience  It made me feel less apprehensive about taking meds  
Yeah  I went cold turkey off of Wellbutrin last year  It ruined my brain  as I now have seizures  I wouldn't recommend it  Just slowly wean off to be safe 
Ask your doctor if Prozac is right for you 
I am pretty much the same  but two years older  and I didn't gratuate high school  Well  I just seem to keep going  Maybe it will get better 
Doing the things that give me anxiety  It sucks  but i just do it  Its getting better now  
Same Here

Wow totally describes my relationship with depression and emotions  or lack thereof  
Doing that right now  Once you are drunk it isnt that difficult  but alcohol always goes both ways
Alcohol  video games and cycling  That's the stuff 
Even the drink can't help getting through this night my God my head feel like it's got a ton of weight on it 
This 
I think I'd do well I don't really need those 2 things anyways
I am  therefore i must post 
I think the biggest mistake I made was ignoring my anxiety  It's sort of a natural response  to push back negative thoughts and emotions  Perhaps our culture is partly to blame because we've idealized "happiness" in a sense and are never taught how to manage negative feelings when they inevitably arise  You're expected to just forget and relax and it'll all work itself out  but of course  it never does   It's something I wish our educational system would do for young people because it certainly would've helped me out if I knew what anxiety was and how to deal with it from a young age  Could help so many people   Anyway  I hope your anxiety eases up and you have a good new years  My new years resolution is to stop worrying so much  We'll see how that works out 
Hey  I love you too  man  I hate that you're going through that right now  
Does not have the same ring to it though  Hip new year perhaps 
Why 12 34  
It's ridiculous I have to drug myself to not want to blow my brains out   To dupe my brain into thinking it's happy   I still hated life even when I had 10k in the bank   Ridiculous 
I don't even know why  but this really made me smile  At the end of the day  we are all different and different things make us happy  Being happy is really the only thing that matters  i think   
Idk
Yeah  that's nowhere near enough 
Hi  Same here  I didn't even have anything I can do  but still it feels bad  I live in the middle of nowhere so i'm not hearing any noises outside  but I bet it feels horrible  But remember it's ok to be not doing anything special  I'm really not the right person to tell you this cause I'm feeling sad too right now  but I want to try cheer you up   try to make you happier  i'm not sure of my language   I'm not sure what to say to you  but try not feel bad cause of your decission  If you feel not going anywhere it maybe is the best to be home then  Think  would you have had fun really  if you decided to not go  Or if you really feel you want to go  is it too late yet  There is still people out there  if you really want to celebrate with others  I really hope you would feel better tonight  It's a hard evening to be depressed  
Thank you for that information  I appreciate your response  
Well at this point I consider I have turned insane

Sounds like you've tried it all   Sorry you haven't had better results   I don't know what to do next 
The way I've improved myself was through my 2016 New Year's Resolution  Never say "no" to invitations    You'd be surprised at the many opportunities that one misses by being afraid to make a move in life   I've experienced many more new things than ever before  Foods from around the world  finally went fishing  finally made new friends beyond my small social circle  finally reached my academic goals and now I find myself starting a new relationship after a couple years of being single   Just follow your heart and happiness will find you

Here's to 2017 being better than this shitshow of 2016 
Hi  I'm new too  so no worries    I started running  which helps the most  I think  I also try to eat fairly decent and to cut down on my caffeine intake when I'm feeling particularly anxious  And I make sure I get enough sleep  That being said  my anxiety is mild to moderate  but all these little things together really help to keep it under control    Edit  I forgot to include this  but if you are religious at all  I also use prayer to help me stay grounded if I am in a really bad place  Meditation is also beneficial  I've used meditation and yoga to help me get to sleep at night   
2015 and 2016 were fkn hell

Have you tried talking about this with your husband  How he keeps getting on your nerves instead of helping you  He seems to care  as he asks you how you're going  but clearly he isn't helping  There's nothing worse when you're not feeling well than having someone pestering you like that  I agree with the comments below  therapy helps  Talking about it helps  You need to let it out  Have you got any friends to whom you could ask for help  Also  something I discovered last Winter when I was very depressed  physical activity is beautiful  Run  swim  do anything  just move  The chemicals in your brain will do wonders and it'll be great for your health  It helps me a lot  When it gets too dark in my brain I go for a run and it clears the clouds away  Hope this helps  Happy new year

I know these thoughts  I know how much they hurt   What brought me peace was this   life exists here  From the harshest environments to the most docile  life exists  It doesn't do this because it's easy  or because it has a purpose  It exists because it CAN  There is opportunity and there doesn't need to be a reason    Yes  things lead to pain  But they lead to happiness too  Sometimes the two aren't equal    You're here because you can be    inside that is infinite possibilty    inside that is hope   Not everything will happen  but anything CAN happen   If you want to talk more  I'm here   
Oh geez    Thanks for the warning  Sorry you had to find out the hard way

You have all my sympathy for dealing with the UK mental health services  They are terrible  Have you tried going to the gym or physically getting the anger out  Or having a moment for yourself in a nice hot bath  How about hobbies  Do those calm you   You are not a waste of oxygen  We humans are pretty bad at dealing with our brain going wrong  It's all well and good knowing you have nothing to be angry about when your veins are pumping adrenaline into every muscle  If you were  your husband wouldn't be asking if you were okay   as silly as it is  it shows that this super angry person isn't the normal you  This is an exception that he still wants to tackle together with you  Nobody asks a waste of oxygen did they'll share their burden with them every five minutes    Finally  don't throw the notion that something in your life is wrong too far away  This might be your body's way of telling you in its non verbal way that something is REALLY wrong  Usually anger is the extra energy our body gives us to change something that is upsetting to us  It might still be that  even if the cause might not be obvious to you or something you feel shouldn't be upsetting you  My recommendation would be anger writing  Next time you feel on edge  grab yourself a pen and a journal and let it all out  Everything that comes into your head  You should be tired  but less angry afterwards  Then go back to what you have written the next day and see if you can pin point a source or reason  
"But you are such a good BOY"      I am 26  I lose hair already  OK

I titrated off of it and a few others at the same time  try to structure it the same way  pace  as you went on it  A few pills less one week  even cut them in half  then less and less each week slow down if you don't feel right  I mean  less right than usual in an abrupt fashion 
happy new year to you  just here to say someone saw this and cared  on the same track as you man  keep going   
I felt like there was more purpose to being alone tonight than anything else
Mind you this was on my own  not under doctor supervision 
Go to your doc with a list of concerns  This is what I did  All of them were dismissed for being common  explainable things    You pay for you doc  so really you are the one to choose this  The doc will tell you if they believe you need further tests  Beyond that  don't over do yourself  The worry will make you FEEL far far far worse than you really are  
It isn't easy  But there is no formal way it needs to be done  Try writing it down    just take time    and then show them  You can do it    and it will help
I am tired of them too  My personal experience   1  I am 30 y o  I have lived in different countries  different continents and met all sorts of people  Not many people attract me beyond their physical appearance  but when somebody does  it is a completely different feeling  a different type of presence  an unmistakable smile that you want to see everyday  Yes  I have met the right person  and she is not with me  Only I know what the feeling of what meeting the right person to me is like  no one has the right to say I haven't met the right person for me   2  I definitely love myself much beyond the average person does  I eat well  I am healthy  I exercise  I don't drink nor do drugs  I am vegan  I love nature  Yet  I am depressed  I have had more failures in life than I can bear  Loving myself doesn't change that   3  I know it doesn't fix  However  not being in a relationship adds to the depression  And it gets worse as you get older   4  I have tried  And I have to tell you  today people are weirder than ever  People are more judgement  they are more politicized  more attached to their thoughts  more narrow mind and more resistant to loving one another  Society nowadays is not a welcoming place for a depressed lonely person   Honestly  I don't have any helpful advice  All I can say is that while the loneliness is extremely painful and haunting  there will be moments in life when you might ignore it  moments in which you might find joy elsewhere  I have struggled with this all my life  and if I knew a way to deal with it  I would not be here 
Should I reach out to her since it's a new year or would it be too expected or corny 
I feel like I have lost too much  It is just painful  But thank you for caring   
I had this when I was around 10 years old it creeped the fuck out of me but eventually I got used to it and learned to cope with it  I'm sure it'll pass just like it came   
Maybe you should be thankful your garbage genes were aborted     you've imposed a shit life   shitty world onto a child  good job 
I've been thinking a LOT about shutting down facebook recently   I didn't even wanna be on it to begin with    and wouldn't have  if i hadn't been dating someone who pestered me into it and had a bunch of terrible friends who convinced her something was wrong with me for not wanting to be on it     The downside is that it might make it harder for people to reach me after having been out of contact for extended periods of time    which I think it's somewhat useful for   Also for people who just know your first name  don't know anybody you know  and maybe wanna get ahold of you for some reason   Aside from that  it's pure waste   Fuck facebook

Hey  you tried something new and found it isn't for you  It's a risk you take when doing something you haven't done before  Now you know that lying in bed isn't your thing  You could have found out that you absolutely love it  Try not to interpret more into it than a single failed attempt  Just go and do something next year  
Noice  I'm attempting dark jokes to cope with depression now and it's a little hard but I think I might like it 
I have heard it is bad for the liver  but in very very very very very few cases  I've been taking it for a long time and haven't had any issues  I'm pretty good at keeping it in low doses   I figure as long as you don't drink or anything at the same time  it shouldn't be to bad  But I agree with your therapist  I'm no professional by any means and appreciate your input greatly  People who may have liver issues may want to look at some other form of relief 
Happy new year
Yep  people who've never been in long term relationships have NO idea how alone you can feel  even while you're in a relationship   Hope it gets better 
My wife doesn't care anymore   She tells me to my face   We haven't even made it a year   I can't stomach the thought of her being with someone else or another man trying to raise my kids    I don't have any friends  And my family can't even help telhem selfs   She's just going to walk away from me and not care 
It would be for Lexapro lol  thanks for the response
i'm in basically the same situation  wishing you all the best 
The worst thing I hate hearing is "stop being a negative thinker"
Not a problem my man  I've been there and I really feel for you  so no worries I'm just really glad I could help  If you try it out  let me know how it works for you  But as the above comment states  do be careful if you've had any liver related health issues as the kava could be harsh on yours 
for the love of god dont do this
I personally hate these types of advice  because they honestly just make me feel worse rather than help  I can't get mad at these people either because I understand that they are just trying to help but don't understand  I really don't know if this will help but I have pretty much given up with actively looking for love  I realized somewhere along the way that life doesn't center around love  If you manage to find love then go for it  but don't pressure yourself into looking for the right person  If I ever manage to find love again that would be great but if I don't thats fine too

I've always been a super heavy smoker  but the past year or so I've been getting ridiculous anxiety and paranoia while high  so I quit a few months ago  I can't even describe the fear  I was deathly afraid of everything  not just social stuff  It was getting way too out of control
I don't think there's a support scheme where I'm from    And I don't think I'm eligible for it since my dad is actually earning decent wage  it's his stupid spendings that worries us most of the time  I've been undergoing treatment for quite some time now  and I've been complaining about wanting to quit my job and sit at home for the past  5 months or more  Told it to my therapist  saying  "If I can choose  I'd rather not work " She said  "So do I  But this is reality  we have to work to survive "  Sigh    She's right  but this is really not what I expected from life  I'm still not accustomed to living as a cog in the machine  being an insignificant part of this indifferent society 
Omg  fuck that 
Feeling you guys tonight 
Have you attempted to make any change since last year  I admit I'm terrible at this and sometimes I feel like I literally can't but I think that's another part of the condition  It turns your reality into hell and then takes away your ability to leave  Stay strong friend

I know it will sound like if i want to make a joke or make you feel upset but       Your mom can't die twice  right  What else is there  to make it worse  It already made you "hollow"  can it be more than that      Death of my mom will be my end  There is nothing worse that can happen in my life  Nothing  I've already stated it times and times again here  I alienated everyone so less people are gonna hurt of me going after her  i am just waiting now  She is 67 and every time i think  say or write this number it terrifies me      Guess how many people called me this NY celebration  Fireworks all over the place  but there is only my mom calling me and this   odd friend from my past  who shows up every new year for some reason to watch me playing video games for an hour  Sometimes it seems like i am already dead and its   thrilling

Can you tell me one     
I think I'd rather stay at home and do some housework  I have a knack for cleaning  But    That's if I get myself a spouse  because I highly doubt I'll be  I have not been romantically attracted to anyone  and finds it illogical to do so  Basically I don't believe in love  Also  I'm born male  so it's further stigmatized if I stay at home   Part time doesn't give the attractive salary that full time has    And the benefits are way less  which    Isn't worth it  I don't know    Oh god I'm so confused

My anxiety is created from mine lmao  When you have anxiety  it will manifest itself in all forms 
Two people called me  one of them is an odd old friend from my past who shows up every new year  another is my mom      I am playing Dying Light on Nightmare and listening to TotalBiscuit's Arbitrary Video Game Awards   2016      You can have fun alone too 
In the end  cutting is just a coping mechanism  It doesn't say anything about you as a person other than that life is demanding one hell of a lot from you right now  If you can  try your other coping mechanisms first and see if the urge goes away or try getting help with some of the things you are struggling with  You would rather hurt yourself than give up  even if the world is being a nightmare  That makes you strong  not weak  
Yup  I'm 21 and haven't been in a serious relationship since I was 17  I tried after it  but was feeling kind of emotionally numb afterwards  Now I'm just plain scared of a relationship  even though I want one so bad  I'm so afraid of opening up to someone and sharing my life with them again  Not to mention the lack of self esteem and all that from the anxiety 
Fair enough  It is the worry that is making me feel like shit  Wish I could make it stop     Though what am I to do if there's something bothering me that I literally have not yet been able to successfully describe

Good job 
The demons are you  they can't leave  You either tame them or live in terror      Tfw i wrote it and realized how accurate this actually is 
The experiences you had won't go away overnight  Change can be tough  and you sometimes have to work at it for a long time  It will be faster and easier with the help of a good counselor therapist psychiatrist   Remember that anxiety is not always proportional to risk  The thing to do  if you can  is to take small risks to recalibrate your anxiety  so that you're still afraid of being eaten by a tiger  but not afraid of a woman telling you to fuck off  Give yourself small challenges every day  like saying hello to a stranger  or giving someone a  genuine  compliment  When you don't complete your daily challenge  forget about it  move on  When you do  reward yourself  After a few months  you will see progress  A tiny bit of progress every day quickly adds up

Same  Feels fucking fantastic 
  While I don't believe in addiction I do think your drinking is a symptom of some sort of personality disorder  As a safety net try naltrexone for a month so you can get ahead of the drinking and focus on what the problem is  You could have ADHD for all I know  Symptoms range from a total disregard for your health to getting hyperfocused on substances  Sucks about the shots   What does naltrexone do  And why would this lead you to believe I have ADHD

If i ever do something wrong even if i correct it or if its not a big deal  my mind just shuts down  Instant self hate mode  I dont dislike working but i just shut myself out too much if something goes wrong  I feel like i cant help it

I have a really hard time explaining what happens to me as well  It's a fear of everything  whatever I think about  there is an underlying fear  
Take it to PM  I'm trying not to be suicidal here and even with the subreddit gone I still get to read petty squabbles   
I think a good question here is this  how did it make YOU feel when it happened what do you think about the situation deep down  I think one thing you could do is maybe sit down with him and talk about it  From what you wrote it seems like he genuinely feels terrible and really misread the situation  however  I can only give my opinion input based on what I have read  Did it make you feel in any way unsafe or violated or give you that creepy gut feeling  
you feel like I copied this

No I mean that what you're saying is exactly how I feel
I'm just gonna chill tonight  because I'm exhausted from work  I want to go to a party but it's a solid hour away  So instead I'm just gonna chill with my bro  order pizza and just enjoy my evening  Tomorrow is a new day  No matter how bad last year was embrace tomorrow even if it's hard  I was once told false positive motivation can turn into real motivation   It's true  Belive in yourself and admit the flaws you have  Then slowly build your life to be that way  Happy New Years all 
I see  I hope it will get a bit easier for you to make friends once you get more comfortable with the language  I wish you a lot of luck and a happy 2017

Well it's December 31 2016  I'm tired  Tired of fighting my demons tired of my physical pain and tired of my emotional pain  I've been fighting my demons for the better part of my life and tonight is the night I will finally win  I'm taking my wife and I laws to dinner and to wherever they want after to make sure everyone has a good time while acting normal like I always do  After we are home and I've had enough booze to kill an ox I have a series of drugs that I will be taking to eventually stop my breathing and my heart while I sleep  I will apologize now to my 16 year old son whom I cherish and 2 unborn children that my wife is carrying not to mention the few members of my family I have left that truly do love and care for me  I love you all and will see you in my next life  I hope others are stronger than me and can over come thier demons  Love to all and take care

Depending on where you live  pure CBD may be available in edible or pill form  It does not get you high on its own  at all  I take 5 10mg at a time  It makes me hungry and happy and sleepy  all of which are very helpful for my anxiety 
Not like stand up but I found it funny when people were talking about how so many celebrities were dying in 2016  Then a comment underneath was like "lucky bastards" and that made me laugh XD
Totally understand  You just want a solution and there's this huge temptation to just throw as much as you can get your hands on to the wall to hope something can stick  But slow and steady wins the race unfortunately   Exercise and generally focusing on building small healthy routines seems to be the only thing I've seen be truly in our own control in regards to pushing us closer to healing    Hope you have a great new years as well  Hopefully 2017 is better than 2016
It actually helps me relax  
Do your best  Name the location  what it feels like  when it occurs  time of day  With certain food  Certain movements    how frequently  and how much it affects your day to day  The doc should be able to understand the severity  if there's any at all    Please remember I am nothing near a medical professional  Always consult your one for things like this  
I'm so sorry  Here if you want to talk 
As far as wanting to hurt people  it's possible you're just really kinky but these thoughts may be an indication of additional mental illness  in particular i was reminded of this  http   www cracked com article 21834 5 realities life when your brain wants you to murder html  you should probably see a medical professional and discuss both issues with them  If I haven't explained enough or you just want to talk feel free to pm me
How long do you think it took you  I've been dealing with it on and off for two years now and I'm starting to feel like it'll never pass and I'll never be able to live a normal functioning life    glad to know I'm not alone  At 10 years old I'm sure it would be extremely scary  Thanks for the support  
Really depends where you are living  I live in Germany and English is my second language  maybe that's why "I love you" doesn't mean too much to me like in German "Ich liebe dich"    I can see why you are sad  I wish somebody would liebe me    But I like you  if that's fine

Yeah dude it got to the point where even when I was smoking alone at my house  once I'd get high  all I could think about were things that would terrify me  That's what drew the line for me cause I realized that if I'm feeling so uncomfortable just smoking by myself  and not getting any enjoyment whatsoever out of it anymore  there's no point to me smoking  It's a shame cause smoking used to be one of my favorite things to do  but I guess it's nice that I've stopped since I'm not spending money on it anymore  I don't have to be scared of getting pulled over with it in the car anymore  and without it distracting me I've been trying to work on myself the past few months  I've been going pretty hard in the gym the past few months and I'm making great progress  which is helping my anxiety cause of self esteem from getting in shape  and also cause of the endorphins and all that which gets released from hard exercising on a regular basis 
this is really cool  Nice job  D
I can relate to you so much  I just feel like every year is getting worse and worse  I'm pretty much the same age as you too

I read the whole thing   I can empathize with some of it especially classroom anxiety   I used to drop a class if I thought I would fail or do poorly  but I changed my policy to powering through everything   I lost a lot of percentage points for attendance and participation  lack there of   I would definitely watch a documentary about your life    
Take on each issue individually and try start with achievable goals  Progressively improve on them  Dont be distracted by social media and others more privileged  If you wanr to use it fot your benefit find idols that inspire you  not all of them had it easy  You have a hunger to succeed that they dont   use it to your benefit  Your english is good keep working on that too  Lastly you are young  Good luck 
I didnt really read the post sorry  But if u cant even remeber ur name and shit like me see if u have adhd  I hardly remeber my name I cant even fucking spell because who gives a fuck   really  haha honestly you have a girlfriend she most like u to be dating imo I would just keep doing what ur doing ur making her happy   And trust me life is faliure since i was born 
My thoughts are with you  Even if you couldn't bring yourself to doing it  remember that you tried  you considered it  you reached out to someone for help  That is more than a lot of people do and it is brave  Remember  one step at a time  I know we want to fix everything all at once  even though we don't know how  Don't push yourself beyond your limits  but do try to focus on at least one goal to achieve  Even if it's as simple as getting up and making your bed in the morning or walking around the block  if you can acheive these goals perhaps you can achieve something harder in time  I hope that even if things didn't go the way you hoped that perhaps you feel lighter knowing  even if it hurts  When we hit rock bottom  there is only one direction to go  You are kind and brave  I believe in you

Dude talk about some bullshit  I hate that list shit of things to do  it makes me so irritated hearing it but it's not like your situation  It's just my chores at home from my mom whom I love   In your case man  forgive me  but I honestly think they're assholes 
  Why would you choose to keep experiencing this day by day  night after night   Life is a joke  and death is the punch line   You get to choose what you pay attention to  and what you ignore   Don't believe everything you think 
Exactly  Im wishing college will go well for me so at least i can feel a bit better and concentrate on fixing myself  but it all seems hopless to me right now

I just don't know what the problem is  I'm not bad looking  decent height weight  ok job  I do have confidence and social skill issues but that does not really come off when I first meet people so it's not like they can see through me that I'm depressed  Each rejection is like a hammer hitting a nail  making me go further down and down each time  until eventually you just want to give up  there is no satisfaction in life anymore
I agree with everything you said  Except I dont think there is a meaning to life  Where just here to exist and tbh I really dont want to  Appreciate ur comment tho

I know  Saying it feels like beating a dead horse but it's true  I'm a student physical therapist interested in working in a collaborative practice focused around the treatment of mental illness  I know several centers that employ a physical therapist to work with patients suffering from mental  not physical  ailments because it's so  so important    I have my own fair share of personal experience with mental illness and I accept that for me personally  I  have to  do some form of exercise every day  some days vigorous  some days active recovery  I  have to  eat well most of the time  This is on top of medication and vitamins  probiotics  fish oil  and rhodiola  It takes upkeep  But it beats being so depressed I let my life pass me by while I rot in despair and emptiness   A big tragedy and part of my life's work is that a lot of people have a very narrow concept of what they think "exercise" is  They think of the gym and they hate the gym  I hate the gym too  But I can run a marathon and move over 100lbs by myself  partly because physical therapy is a manual labor job   I love being outside in nature and so that is where I exercise in my spare time  Other people like being social and might enjoy something like swing dancing or rec league basketball  Others yet might be curious about yoga or pilates  Some don't have any interest in exercise whatsoever but can commit to walking 30 minutes a day if they think of it as part of their treatment  Movement is medicine  Some people like it  some people think of it as a necessary evil  but the key point is that it is in fact  necessary  for good mental and physical health  I am still learning how to best convey this to my patients but if they only listen to one thing I say  that's the most important take home message

Last year I was decluttering my room  11 foot by 11 foot room completely full of junk that I've had my entire life  When I say completely full I mean you could barely even enter the room  Like what you'd see on tv level bad    Anyways  I was all alone last year and didn't have a bed or a couch to sleep on so I got drunk alone just sitting on my floor in a corner until I fell asleep    What proceeded that New Years was by far the worst year of my life  Dog dying  being abandoned by the very few friends that I thought I had  Dad having a massive heart attack are some highlights  There was quite literally zero positive days for me in 2016   I feel so much worse today than exactly 1 year ago  The only difference I felt like a year has made is that I have a bed to sleep on tonight    I don't really know why I'm sharing this  I guess your post just reminded me of myself

I was at a new years party that was pretty tough  A ton of happy drunks  A lot of "PP  why are you moping  You should have more fun"  etc  I just can't feel like that anymore  I suffered through it and read this subreddit on my phone not to feel alone   After a bunch of people had left  someone asked me publicly "What are you doing on your phone  PP "  I said "Reading  r depression "    That changed the mood quite a bit  but then we had a long talk about depression and therapy  Everyone talked about the things in their life that they were struggling with  and it felt 10x better than the stupid new years countdown   Happy New Year   r depression  I hope things work out for you  xoxo 
 Stop thinking that you're overly worried about the environment  You have a healthy worry about our planet  The thing is anxiety latches onto anything it finds  blows it out of proportion  inhibits you from taking your mind off of it at all  and makes it seem like it's the end of the world    The way it takes over your mind can be horrifying and make you want to be asleep  Seek professional help when it gets to that level  Medication and therapy can be a lifesaver   Edit  you're not seeing what other people aren't  You're super overreacting because of anxiety taking over your mind  I know it feels like it's a genuine worry  but it's not you  it's you on anxiety

I'm in a club right now  just as lonely  
It depends on how comfortable with telling people you are  I've had mild PTSD for many years due to childhood abuse and it became much more pronounced in my daily life after being raped last year  I am super comfortable telling people my experiences and making sure they know why I do certain things I didn't do before  which is totally personal to me  you may feel differently   I'm lucky my friends have been super supportive and understanding  and I think if you feel comfortable with it  it may be beneficial to tell them  I've actually gotten a lot closer with certain people after telling them because they share similar situations  And those who don't understand  I find I don't miss them in my life  Good luck  I hope things work out  friends are such a great support system 
Everyone is different but especially since starting medication for my OCD I get WRECKED emotionally after drinking or taking Vicodin  alcohol also effects opiate receptors   It takes up to a week or so to get my mind back together  What I recently noticed is that tequila doesn't have as bad an effect on me and I learned that tequila is the only alcohol  that I've heard of anyway  that is a stimulant instead of a depressant  I'm going to experiment with this further and see if my theory holds out  If not I guess I'm done drinking because it's just not worth it 
Agree  please report stuff like this as it violates the posted rules and we will remove it as soon as we find it  
Thanks for the tedious lecture  genius 
My year hasn't sucked as much as yours  but then again it isn't really a contest  This year I was diagnosed with Dissociative Identity Disorder  had to abandon two friend groups because I was too dumb to realize I was the asshole  BOTH TIMES   and had two relationships that I had no emotional connection to  I'm about to go into another one and I don't want to fucking do it again but I don't know how to stop it   So here I am  alone again on New Years Eve  listening to The National  just like I was last year  The only change is I have no hope for the future  Even though I'm still very young I just can't see it improving  especially not with what I learned about myself this year 
Depression is hard to deal with end of story  But there is hope  Stay strong    we are all here in the same boat with different problems  I have been where your at  It may seem hopeless now but You will get trough it  Ive been depressed for a long time  I dont know what you are going trough right now but the pain will go away and you will learn how to deal with your issues   3
Friends invited you 
Don't feel bad for liking for someone  Its not like you choose you like  I met this awesome girl same interests same hobbies and most of same banter etc    In my mind shes perfect girl but she has a boyfriend  So yeah just continue talking to her be her friend if it is meant to happen you'll find out  Yo yo mate I think same i was in a taxi and was thinking i wish a sniper would shoot me xD  but dont feel bad for liking someone its not like u choose to like her its just human instincts imo
May i ask if they were online tests  Because im pretty sure that most 13 year olds feel like they have SEVERE ANXIETY DEPRESSION PTSD BIOPOLAR because they went online and took a quiz telling them that because they feel sad they have depression
I relate to that but coming from somebody who's never felt attached to his family you should hold on to them in your darker hours  as long as you're not being a burden on them who says you need to move out  Don't feel pressured by what society says is "normal" you do what makes you happy 
This year I will be happy  that I can guarantee  
I really do not recommend self medicating with alcohol  My boyfriend did that with his depression and was an alcoholic for 15 years
Sorry it didn't help 
Sorry if I'm stating the obvious here  but that's just good ol' depression for you  The funny thing about depression is that it's not always sadness and hopelessness and crying  sometimes it's just    numbness and nothing  Depression is also when you don't feel like doing anything anymore  when you lay down in bed all day  with a hole inside that can't seem to be filled  staring at a wall  trying to will yourself into doing  something   and then waiting for the day to end so you can rinse and repeat  It's not wanting to do anything  even with things that seem mundane like getting up to get something to eat or a cup of coffee  it's not enjoying things you used to enjoy  it's apathy and anhedonia  
Be careful    the rash is a life threatening reaction from this medication  Go to the ER to be sure

You can do anything you fuckin want man  Hate Workin  Get a job that ain't work  We're in a new generation where you don't just grit your teeth and take life's phallus your whole life to "maybe" retire happy  Fuck that  And you know what  I don't know you  but if you posted here then you wanted help  And that means that you don't like that you're unhappy man  And good on ya  Maybe I'm drunkenly talking out my arse though  New year  New you   
This sounds a lot like dissociation in general  Probably derealization  but I've found that everything gets kinda blurry within the category of dissociation   Definitely talk with your therapist or doctor  They can give you some good ideas   In the meantime  especially if this is bothering you  try researching grounding techniques  The physical ones especially have helped me a lot  like putting on hand lotion  feeling how my feet feel on the floor  scents  warm showers  etc  
I want you to know something   This is normal  It doesn't make it any easier  but you aren't alone in feeling this  Millions of 13 year olds are feeling the same right now and many are going to be able to move past it  I hope you can  I want to warn you not to fall into self destructive behavior and to try to get help  Avoid drugs and alcohol especially because you could form very VERY psychologically harmful addictions  And most importantly  hold on to your friends  I wish I did  even if you don't really like them  Someone there who doesn't give a shit is still someone there   Remember you're 13  you have two ways in life  Either you conquer it  rather you minimize it  eventually or you just get used to it  There is always suicide  but don't do that  There's really no point  You'll get out into the world soon enough and then you can do whatever the fuck you want  Maybe not  whatever   but you're far more free   Just hang in there  dude 
Thanks  I really hope I can get into somewhere at least semi decent  Do you not get a student loan in America  
I'm pretty sure all effects depend on dosage which is usually increased gradually when it comes to anti depressants  At least SSRI   Sadly those meds can make anxiety worse before they kick in for real  for some people it takes some experimenting with different meds of the same kind to find one that works properly   Yeah right now I use "quick fix" and that's enough at least for now  I'd rather avoid anything more powerful   I keep my dosage as low as possible even now  and especially anti depressants because they made me rather numb emotionally  I'd use them if I had to though but I'd seek therapy ASAP too 
Hope 2017 turns out to be brighter for you
Hey im 25 and live with my parents  Honestly it sucks sometimes  My sex life sucks  My friends have moved on  I just work and feel like a robot stuck in the same old routine sometimes  But you know what  I love my parents  And they love me  Im sure your grandma doesnt hate you  Try to spend more time with her so she knows you appriciate everything she is doing for you  I promise you whatever she "hates" you fir tonight doesnt mean anything long term    Dont let the the hateful attitude she may sonetimes give you impact the way you feel  Im sure it can be resolved    Its a new year new start new opportunities to grow closer to one another  I dont mean to sound supwr depressing but your grandma won't be around forever  I know i was 11 when mine died and i didnt get to say goodbye  My other grandma has alsheimers so i slowly watched her mind slip from her  Take advantage of the time you have with her by doing whatever you can to make her happy  Even if she has an attitude or whatever  I promise this will make both of you feel better everyday living with one another 
Just letting you know what my grandad said to me " Where living in hell now soon as you die you go to heaven " Does matter what ur dad does it makes happy thats all that matters its his choice and im glad something brings join to him  and we are all responsible for our choices imo but if it makes u happy go for it  Legit u work for a job u hate i appreciate that i cant even do that  Working for something someone u Dislike that takes balls  U need the money and u do it  I dont care 
Anytime    What have you lost  If it's ok me asking   
Thus this post is pointless 
It's all about what you smoke  It always made me really anxious  but after moving to Seattle and knowing what exactly I'm smoking and figuring out what i need is a wonderful tool that helps me get the best sleep I've had in a very long time  Coming from someone who never could sleep at all because of anxiety  
1  Waiting does nothing ffs  It won't magically get better by itself  Just "being out there" and "being present" also doesn't do anything  I could do this again for years without  any  results  It's very  very hard work for me  nothing else    2  Me too  Telling me to love myself is like telling an arab guy what's the best snow to ski on    3  No  but my problems are the reasons I'm not in a relationship and I'm certain that a relationship now and then  could be  related to happiness  and a feeling of selfworth   Just an idea of me   4  And see how few things I am able to do  Observing others who are healthy and having fun  Yeah  that worked well for years    Not sure what I can tell you  Have you tried online dating  It might be easier 
You too  happy new year   
Well 2 thoughts  1  My HOCD became completely manageable once I stopped caring if I was gay  Once I wasn't frightened by the idea it went away  So work on that  There are many ways to go through life and I know so many wonderful gay people in my life who live very well     2  I would try to figure out through your therapy and treatment why you are acting on your thoughts  Not trying to make your HOCD worse  but I personally find it interesting that you engage in your thoughts  Might be completely normal for OCD  but I think it's worth asking a professional about   If it turned out you are actually attracted to men and you could learn to accept and be ok with that  it could change your life for the better

It works for me  explains a lot actually  
Feeling very similar  You're not alone in this    I could leave it and do anything else  But I'm having so low energy and no idea what to do else 
Dont worry about Facebook  Not worth using  And there is nothing wrong with spending some time alone  I hope you have a better 2017  Stay positive
Will do from now on  thanks
You dont need God to be happy xD people still belive in santa etc     Plus im proud of u bro grill     I'm glad u found something that makes u want to be happy 
Yeah man that only happens to me when I'm in an uncomfortable environment 
I didnt read much of it but  Atleast ur looking for a job and shit that takes alot of effort imo  I cant be arsed getting out of bed tbh   Atleast ur trying to better urself thats all that matters imo  People call ur lazy etc    who gives a fuck ur trying and i appreciate that
It is kind of sad  So far High school sophomore year was the best time of my life  and now things kinda suck lol
I always told myself I'd never do anything rash or stupid while in an emotional state  emotion clouds your judgement  I can look back on times I've 1000  wanted to die but now I'm kind of glad I didn't
Awful  Two grandparents and my family dog of twelve years died  My self esteem has sunk lower and lower and I've further isolated myself from the rest of the world by maintaining as few friendships and relationships as possible because my perception of myself is so distorted that I don't find myself worthy of them

The reason I dont have social media  That and the fact I dont have friends  
Ok thanks  can't really go to a professional though  I guess i'll try 'stop caring'  
A lot of Hollywood Undead songs  Bullet  Pain  Hear Me Now  Black Dahlia to name a few    Edit  genre is rock  Sort of 
Alcohol makes my anxiety worse  So does caffeine and sugar  
Yo imo anyone can make friends anyone even you  She just cares about you but has trouble saying it  Like why arnt u enjoying urself with friends etc      She just wants to know why ur not enjoying urself but like me u dont know  Dont be too hard on her she just wants the best 
Holy guacamole  This is the best explanation I have come across so far  Thanks a lot for the link  I really thought everyone once in a while thinks about murdering people  Like not in a 'I really want to kill XYZ  because XYZ is stupid' but more in a 'What would happen if I pushed XYZ in front of a car '  And sometimes it really itches in my fingers to just do it  but obviously I don't do it   ain't nobody got time to go to jail   Thanks for the link again  
Happy new years  Hey at least you have a friend to celebrate with  Mine all moved away  My ex cheated on me this last year and she was my everything for years and years    Maybe this will help you  in the next year i hope to find a person to hangout with  I dont care if we pick each others noses  kidding  Just know that i had the worst year imaginable and that you are lucky to have another person to even talk too    But i am feeling optimistic about this coming year  I hope that i find someone that i can make happy enough to reply to my texts or hangout with and do whatever  Im going to do what ever i can to make even 1 friend     Sometimes if u step back and look at it from someone elses perspective it helps you feel better  I hope i have helped even a little bit   
Good for you     not sarcasm

Fuck  I am so miserable right now  I feel like I'm cursed to be alone  Does it get better  I got some good things coming up in the next few weeks but I'm worried it won't be enough  I'm tired of being me

Glad it helped
Geez  that was a bad one  I'm usually anxious but sometimes i think myself into a bad depression  this was one of them  Im better now  I guess i just needed a little pick me up  Im fine now  but anxiety will probably set in soon  that or ill go into another depression  Thank you so much for your willingness to talk though  you don't know how much that means to me  
First and foremost  focus on your breathing  It's very easy to lapse into mouth breathing or feeling like you can't get enough air  which keep the stress cycle going  Try to gradually slow it down  if you can find some music to time it to that helps  A friend was advised told to hold her breathe for several beats inbetween each breath because it resets the body  since you can't be running from danger if you're not panting   Depending on the severity  at work I would find an alcove and take a moment to text call my bf  ask a colleague to hug me or take a bathroom break so I could drop the mask for a few minutes  If I was having a really bad day I'd let colleagues know I couldn't deal with people and go out back and clean things and count down to end of shift  Using muscle memory is soothing because you're not relying on memory   At family events I hide in my phone  just scrolling through facebook without really seeing it  or if that's not allowed I just put on a listening face and go quiet  If it's a party with animals I go pat play with the pets  you look busy and it's soothing and distracts from using your memory  I find looking at cats really helps  stroking a fabric  I wear a polar fleece jacket so i always have my favourite texture with me   and messaging standing close to my partner  Even just stroking your own arm can help if it feels right   Positive statements can be hard to remember but they can help  as simple as 'it's okay' or 'this will pass'  right up to 'I'm allowed to make mistakes  everyone forgets things  no one expects you to be perfect' ect  Saying out loud to others that you're out of it  had a broken nights sleep or whatever can also take some of the pressure off  Everyone's felt like that at some point  and will be more accepting if you forget or do something silly   My therapist recommends grounding and a safe space you can mentally go to  so you concentrate on the five senses to bring you back to your surroundings  or have  ago to image that's comforting  for me it's a memory of my cat in a quiet house  and you keep building that image up until it feels real with all the senses   I used to dissociate all the time  zero memory  so I started just by staring at something until I could see details in it again  reminding myself where I was  and working on not yelling at myself for forgetting everything  I would write everything down and always put it in the same place so when I panicked I could go there and check what I was doing  as simple as 'phone  keys  wallet' and as complex as the list for closing the store  in order  I wrote it every day because it helped me focus but it still felt like wading through mud in my mind  You're going to forget things and get distracted easily but it's a protective mechanism  you've just got a lot of ram going to processing something in the background and stress puts you into fight flight so it shuts down longterm memory and other processes   I hope some of this helps  It's so frustrating to lose a detail you just had moments before

I can get loans and stuff but going out of state in America can add a lot of money to tuition and housing and such  can get up to about a  20 000 difference or sometimes more   Im getting scholarships and in state tuition where im going  but it will still cost a lot once i start to pay off the loan  The field im going into wont pay out much in the beginning  which will result in a lot more work on my end to pay everything off  Thats why my family puts a while lot of pressure on me to get more scholarships

Your welcome   How are you tonight   I am just hanging out at home tonight  Not sure if I'll make it to ring in the new year  I'm getting sleepy lol 
Feeling really alone recently  My birthday was the 23rd and a depressive episode kicked in as I woke up  I'm trying to get myself out of it but it feels kind of pointless  My fiancée is in Chicago with her best friend and sisters right now while I'm in our hometown with my parents   I don't know  I'm just really hoping this new year changes things for me   but with the current state that seems unlikely  but I'm trying to be positive  and right now I know that's all I can do  I'm looking for cheap therapy nearby as I just got new health insurance  so hopefully  hopefully I'll get better 
Social phobia  i'd like to join them but i think so little of myself in a social setting that i dont even try to engage with them  
I have just gone to bed at 3am after spending 8 hours at a house party with 30 people and 20 of which I never met before today  and I've just been wandering back and forth between the dance floor and the lounge and bar talking to people for 1 minute at a time or less until awkward silence kicked in and made them uncomfortable  How to make 20 people dislike you in one night  and 2017 has only just begun   I just ran out of "awkwardness attempts" and decided I wanted to go to sleep instead  Music is still booming loud out there and the 20 people are still there  It felt like a walk of shame  I'm here as my sister's little brother and we're all adults  so I feel like I've been the ultimate portrayal of self defeatedness  I've not bonded with one person out of 30 and tomorrow I'm going back to my city and study in my dorm and continue to go down my hole of loneliness because every time I go outside I'm met with people I just can't relate to 
Lots of dealerships have somewhere between a 24 hour and 7 day "changed you mind" policy  If you honestly can't afford it and didn't pay the debt off I'd plead with them to take it back  
laughing  slight glances  talking  i'm simply paranoid around other humans  It's crippling
Yes  that is what I tell myself  I should rephrase it  I can't be sure of right or wrong without an absolute answer  God being an example 
Not that complicated of a problem  but still ruining my life haha
Worth going to urgent care  Being dead would suck  
Every time 
I know exactly how you feel   Lost my mom in February this year  and also blame myself   For that and other reasons  sleep is literally the best part of my day   I have    contemplated death   And like you  I remember the ones who need me   even if I have nothing else to contribute to their lives but my presence   Most of the time words are a hollow comfort  but my mom used to say  "You can't fall out of a ditch" when I was down   And I would remind her that "at least we have noses "  I mean really  without them  we'd all be walking around looking like Voldemort with no olfactory sensation     I guess I mean to say that I feel the same sense of desolation   The feeling that nothing will ever get better   But I have to believe it will  and look for the small hopes and happy moments and silly  stupid humor     Those moments are few and far between  but I think our moms would want to see us smile   I hope you can find a smile  my thoughts are with you    
I definitely understand what you mean in a sense  We have similar experiences  I find it interesting what you say about light sensitivity  I get that whitish light while looking at things as well  And the fact that you are also overwhelmed with existence  It really does drive me nuts  I'm actually more comforted by the thought of death than I am life  Also it's slightly terrifying thinking of the fact that we may possibly exist forever  I don't know how everyone else lives without feeling this way  It's just so overwhelming   Life is strange  But I'm comforted knowing I'm not the only one feeling this way  I really hope you and I can get back to feeling normal    Or at least able to cope with these feelings  Does being around other people bother you too

Im a terrible fucking hypochondriac  like 1   2 weeks every month il fucking break down  just this last week i had a huge im going blind scare  turns out im not   but for 2   4 days im a mess 24 7 panic attacks  but after that i go eh  fuck it  mind you i still have slight anxiety as i have GAD    But  in the beginning  i had a huge heart attack scare  and that lasted for a month  what helped me get a huge grip back was going to the doctor  and told them what was going on  and they gave me a A okay  but do to anxiety i was thought maybe they where wrong and they did not see it  but every attack i told myself there is legit nothing i can do and there no point to suffer every day and it helped me power through it  Now this is all pretty jumbled so apologies  if you need to talk about it talk to someone PM me  i have a discord   Also dont google symptoms  you have most likely heard this one a lot but its true  your anxiety feeds off this     
I'm currently in therapy  Maybe not being prescribed stuff yet means she doesn't think I'll need them  which is nice 
Hey  hit me here or inbox or Steam  same name   I am sure we can play together and you can talk to me if you want  I am a complete stranger after all  right  It WILL make you feel better and you may even get some advices in return  win win kind of situation  
This has to be the weirdest year of my life  It got really bad in the last few weeks  I just want this year to be over  I'm alone and miserable  Things are happening for the better and I hope to use that momentum to try to be finally happy  I hope you guys have a happy new year  There is hope for all of us  I know it 
We're all kinda in hell at the moment  this plane of existence is quite painful  we're all coping in our own ways  be it with delusions  drugs  cigarettes  violence  bullying    Etc  Etc  We're all in pain   I don't care if my dad is happy  he's being irresponsible  I should add that at times  he'd ask for my mum for money  and my mum earns very little  less than  500 a month   I don't really hate my job  in fact  I quite like it  except for a few tasks and 'work hazards'  fucking fire ants and the blazing sun  that really turns me off   What do you mean by 'I don't care'

From what you describe  it seems as though he wasn't trying to hurt you   He expressed clear and sincere remorse   What that doesn't change is how you feel about this   Some women can hold a conversation  set boundaries  and feel secure in moving forward   For others  it's a relationship ender   Either is fine  if you know what you want   And I know it can be confusing   The key here is what you believe of him and what you are comfortable with moving forward     If you feel on the fence about it and you believe the relationship is strong otherwise  think about couples counseling   It could be brief and helpful for something like this

I'm defeated only 6 hours until new year's and 2017 will still  Ake me Depressed 
Happy new year  Hey a supermarket isn't a bad job  You can get promotions fairly easily  I used to work at one for 3 years  I feel the same way  Everyday feels like its exactly the same to me  I am a robot wandering about this earth  But trust me hard work pays off   You seem like you have the weight of the world on your shoulders  Just take a deep breathe and relax  Who cares if your a virgin  So what  Would you rather have an STD  My point is just dont be so hard on yourself  Everyone your age has barely started adulthood  What i mean by that is take the most promiscuous person from high school and how many times do you think they have had sex    not as many times as you think    Just take a deep breath  I'm 25 and sometimes still think like "why bother with life  I'd rather be dead" but you know what  I'm going to keep trying  When you start to focus on your own death at such a young age people dont want to hangout with you  They are at the age where they are enjoying and living life    I've been there before trust me  Please dont let the years go by  Before you know it you'll be my age saying " damn i should have done this or that" Don't keep looking at the past all the time  Don't stress about what the future has to bring whatever happens happens and you have to live in the present    Its a very hard confusing time in your life trust me i know  But all the parties and shit wont mean anything in a few years  Really what are u missing out on  Drunk high people screaming at each other and backstabbing each other   Maybe focus on like school or something before its too late  Im just now getting back into school because it was like every year something would come up i had to deal with  Just make a plan and reach for the sky  
Yep  I agree with you  Everything about my life gets worse by the minute  The world seems to do the same  
Hey there  I appreciate your devil may care attitude  but here's the thing  I'm not sure what I'd do if I were to quit now  not sure what kind of job I'd take up  I can't picture myself having a long lasting career    I'm too undecided to stay rooted  I've considered being a librarian or a diver  but the former might require me to cut my hair  and the latter needs some courses and a certificate  not to mention it's quite the travel from my house to the workplace   Drunk huh  I rarely drink    I hope you're having a good time  and yes  Happy New Year 
Happy new year to you and your sweet little friend there  I know what it means to have a special relationship with your dog     May the new year bring you both great things    Edited for spelling typo

I played it once with friends  it got me out and about for the first time in months  But I haven't played it since  I live in a rural area so it's not very good unless we drive to the city  
Okay so this morning I didn't have D   so I ate Taco Bell  Which was probably a mistake   since I haven't had anything like that in a week and a couple hours later I had a little D     I'm PRAYING it's from where I haven't eaten something like that in a week

Is there an option to maybe snug a person for you out of a big party  Or maybe you can wait untill some of them leave  Or maybe you can take a walk with someone to their home  Hitting a brick wall with your head  by overthinking all those problems can't help you  right      Last time i was in the situation like you i was   washing dishes after everyone  Kitchen was near so i was listening to everything they say  i WAS with them  in a way      Maybe you can snug a glass of something  find a comfy chair and just sit somewhere not far  listen to them and watch the sky or fireworks      I'm sory but i have to go to sleep  its 05 00 for me and i need to be at work tomorrow 16 00 and i have some housework for tomorrow too      I wish you the best  Don't hit that wall  put a chair next to it  or look for a window or a backdoor  Metaphors

My depression has responded best to the following  out of the tens of meds  combos I've tried  Ritalin  Abilify  Kratom  Oxycodone  Provigil  I have 'atypical' depression FWIW  Naturally  don't start the Oxy unless you have to  
I wish I could tell you that it does  but in my experience that would be a lie  Sorry to say  Naturally  I can't speak for you  though  Who knows  maybe you'll feel better in a week  But for me it's hard to find meaning in anything  There is not a single thing that I want in life  Nothing matters  I guess the one thing I want is a quick and peaceful death  Either that  or happiness  but the latter seems rather unlikely  Sorry if I sound too negative  I don't want to further discourage you  
I guess that's it  We  have  to believe that it will   Thank you for sharing this  I relate so much with what you've said   And with a HP reference  to top it off  Haha   Let's continue living for those moments  kind stranger

Forgive me but how can the election bother you this much  I doubt your life on a day to day basis will change much at all  
Number 3 is so fucking true  I know I would have these problems whether I was with someone or not  but what's wrong with having someone who truly loves you  in spite  of your problems  It's better than not having that 
I decided to start using Tinder because who knows  maybe it'll be easier to talk to girls there  I matched with a girl  was very nervous to even start the conversation but forced myself to type in the "hey"  she responded and we talked for maybe like a couple of hours about random stuff  At the end of the conversation I pretty much asked "hey  could we maybe move on to whatsapp " and she gave me her number  Really wasn't any flirting involved  I just sorta talked like I would with a friend   I haven't said anything else to her yet but hoping to ask her out on a date or something tomorrow  even though I have no idea how that should go    Even though it might seem like nothing  this is honestly significant for me because I have a hard time talking to anyone irl  especially girls  because I'm always afraid of rejection   So even if nothing else comes from this at least now I have a little bit more confidence and can sorta copy some of the things that worked this time the next time I talk to a girl  
Hi littletoottoot   Unfortunately  what you are going through is very common for a lot of survivors   Some will believe and support you  some will not   There is so much misinformation about sexual assault and what consent is and isn't   Add to that that most people don't want to be put in the position of thinking someone they know is capable of doing something so horrendous   I's easier to blame the victim or think there must have been a mistake  when there clearly wasn't   Having a community  like here or RAINN or therapy  anywhere people will be able to understand your situation and provide support  is good   I always say  despite how much therapy I can do  a major key to recovery is having a good support network   That could be family  friends  or even strangers on the internet who are there when you need them   You are welcome to write as much or as little as you are comfortable   The mods do our best to monitor the forum and remove any unhelpful remarks   I wanted to caution you about requesting PMs from people   We've had some incidents where predators will use posts here to contact and further harm our community members   Use your judgement  but if anyone tries to tell you what happened wasn't rape or was your fault in any way  please report them and break off contact   We usually ask posters to confine their interaction to their threads  but we also understand that a great deal of healing can come from the personal connections people have made here   The best I can say is to be on guard and never give out personal information that could identify you   If   you   decide to PM somebody  that's your choice of course   All my best 
I made it outside today too  just barely  Even if for a few hours sitting on my laptop in a coffee shop  watching everyone converse with others  NYE is my most hated holiday of the entire year  and it never fails to disappoint  You'd think a person would be used to it at this point  I still have  6 hours left  but always end up knocking out well before midnight 
I just now discovered tonight was New Year's Eve after googling hours for a restaurant  I normally don't do anything for New Years but was thinking about going out tomorrow  Oh well  maybe next year haha  
Happy new year  fellow human
Hmmm it's the opposite with me  When I'm alone I'm much more calm  It's also weird that you think smoking brought this on because this is also the reason I had to stop smoking  Instant panic attacks and overwhelming sense of consciousness  
Thanks for that  just might be the motivation I need to pick up the phone and make an appointment 
As 17 year old  I've been through some bad spots  Talk to someone  It's the most important step  It's bad now  If you can survive this you can survive the next thing 
Same thing happened to me tonight  All of my friends are with their SO's  I'm eating a gun tomorrow  Hopefully then they'll all get the hint that I was suffering

Okay im going to be a little hard on you alright  Don't hate me    I'm 25 and dated a girl for ten years  since high school  and she cheated on me   The f    d up part is she chested on me while i was visiting her own grandfather by myself in the hospital a day before he died   Some girls just do not f     I paid her rent  helped her with her mother's death  funeral   and gave this girl everything  She was the only girl i looked at  So you can take it from me when i say that this woman is playing you    If you stepped up for her vhild when it wasnt yours that makes you a fantastic guy  really it does man  I dont want you to think im knocking you for that  But now she see's she has an income babysitter and she thinks she can do whatever she wants  Just like my girl " oh hes at the hospital with my papa so i dont need to worry about that today  Hmm what should i do to pass the tine" you get what i mean    You seem like me  one of the good guys  This world has certain types of female that prey on guys like us  They can't make up their f       mind on which flavor of ice cream they want so they just try all of them  I dont know the entire story obviously   Dont let her string you along man  Do you want to spend your whole life wondering if shes f       another dude when your not around    Sure i mean you have kids involved and you can act civil towards each other but she seems like she doesnt know what she wants unless its you to be around as the dad    My advice is be the best damn dad u can be bro   i dont have kids  if it were me  i would find another girl even if it takes a while  Kids get attached to whoever u bring home so make sure u dont have like a different girl everynight you know just find a good girl who doesnt mess with you head and give u mixed signals like this one does  They do exist  the good guys like u n me have just got to find them  
My  then  therapist and psyhciatrist described this to me like that  anti depressants suppress your emotions which you actually need to feel in order to sort them out  Therefore  the more you take them  the less you can get out of your therapy  On the other hand they're very useful when you can't get much out of your therapy because emotions are too strong   Based on that knowledge I'd consider it a good sign if they know how hard it is for you  I assume you tell them  and refrain from prescribing anything  If in doubt  just ask them if they think it would help you either with therapy or life in general 
I'm with OP  Gunna start this year off right with a quality suicide attempt  Hopefully it works  
110  feel the same man i've been suicidal my entire life  changed how i act around people so they'll like me  i have NO friends  get maybe 2 texts a week from my father pretty much asking if i've killed myself or not  I haven't been to a bar or even a store with a friend for probably close to 2yrs I really  really have been trying to get the balls to hang myself but now i'm thinking of seeing a professional and maybe try meds before I do  idk why i wrote all this shit  wish you the best of luck man
Same to you  Happy new year 
The reason for not allowing advertising yourself as a helper is that it's a slap in the face to the OPs who've poured their hearts out and asked for help   There are always people who have not received enough good responses   why not reply to them   The reason for not allowing helpers to invite PMs as a first resort is that there's no reason for someone who's legitimately here to help to avoid scrutiny of their comments by the community     
 removed 
This is a terrific response   I love how much hope and encouragement you have  given how hard all of this is   I really like your strategies and that you were able to make new  supportive friends   A good chunk of healing work is helping your mind to re focus  sometimes forcibly  onto positive things   You exercised this idea really well 
I want to blow my brains out at a house party in front of all my "friends"

It always happens during times when I've been stressed for a prolonged amount of time  Thank you though  I've decided to attempt to book a doctors appointment 
Man  I wish it were persistently effective for me  
Thank you for your feedback  I'm taking this day by day  hopefully a visit to the psychiatrist will help or at least give me some answers 
Why can't you go to a professional  Is your OCD not being treated at all  If that's the case it'll just move onto a new theme if you beat this one  That's my experience anyway 
Thank you SO much  I totally appreciate all of this advice  I was in the middle of a Fry's department store when I read this  and my anxiety was just running rampant  But looking at quotes was incredibly helpful  It helped me ground myself a little and made me look at myself objectively and not through my haze of emotions   I'm just getting started on mindful meditation  but it's hard to find time to just concentrate on that and not on the hundreds of other things that I do in my day  I'll have to make it a priority in the new year      Thanks again  
Thank you for this  I feel like theres days when I'm great but then the smallest things make me feel physically sick in my throat when I think about it going wrong etc  but when it's making me feel physically sick thats when I feel it hard to cope  I think I'll go to the doctors asap and just see what they make of it all  Thanks again 
As far as i know i was born with mine too  My mom says so at least  Maybe she was the one that implanted it in my head       
Goddamn this speaks to me really hard   
The first time I took Provigil I started putting in 15 hour work days out of the blue     YMMV of course  but just saying  Now it has no discernable effect  
That sucks   But why did she send you pictures  Keep your heads up though  today a new  365 pages long story starts and you're just about to write the beginning    
Love the attitude man  I feel the same way  today is just another day  why dwell on it and be sad when there's PLENTY of other people that aren't doing anything on NYE as well  I'm going to enjoy this 3 day weekend and look ahead to the future  Happy New Year to you  your brother and everyone you care about 
Agreed   
Thank you  it didn't even occur to me to really seek medical advice  but you're right  Thanks for your help  it's so hard to function when I can't feel my hands hahaha
Hope so too   Just remember that it can take time to get meds straightened out so as cliche as it may sound  patience is key

I get you  I tried to reach out to my parents telling them how I didn't want to live in 2017  My mother's response  She went on to tell me about how she had just programmed the DVD player and ignored my confessing that I planned to kill myself  
I was thinking this a lot yesterday  What the actual fuck goes on inside us  Why do our brains want us to suffer  It doesn't make any fucking sense  Mental illness really sucks and I wish it would all just fuck off for everyone  So many people crippled by mental illness are often the kindest  smartest  most creative and generous people out there  and it's so saddening that this kind of shit happens to them  I hope some day in the future there will be something to permanently rid someone of mental illness    I hope everyone has a better year and more luck in fighting your problems in 2017  2016 was goddamn hell buy I believe in all of you that y'all can beat this shit 
Your posts have been absolutely beautiful  thank you 
I'm on mobile and can't talk much but I really didn't want to forget about your post  I'll try to add more later  But basically you're not a social justice warrior  A sjw is someone who is  not always suffering from a mental health disorder or been traumatized  They are the types to want to silence everybody and shut them up if they feel they are saying something that would hurt them or a generalized perception of a large group of people  They appropriated the term trigger from post traumatic stress disorder which caused it to lose all meaning  Trigger for them could literally be anything triggering any emotion  not just a ptsd flashback or severe anxiety atrack  Often times sjws claim different opinions are triggering to shut them up unfairly  Eg  Someone says they don't like then feminist movement  SJWs are very angry and hateful and yell a lot  The term mutated from keyboard warrior  which was just a realky angry person having an unternet fight  Not all feminists are even sjws  it's the super angry hateful people who you can't even talk too    What you're suffering is an anxiety and what you've described are the mechanics and patterns of avoidant behavior from anxiety  It's all just a normal part of anxiety and it doesn't mean you're like the type of people who get called sjws at all    You're not a pussy or weak either  Anxiety is so powerful because it was a survuval mechanism for us   The internet can seem black and white but there are a lot of moderate and sensible people out there  You're one of them yourself  and you're on a place right now full of people who understand   Also since I'm already talking about this I figure it won't hurt too say this  I don't like the people you described either because with safe spaces and self censorship I see them self inflicting and self imposing severe anxiety upon themselves which I have been through because I live with cripplling agoraphobia from ptsd and autism  It's so sad    
I'm forced to be with my family   and I already told like 10 jokes nobody laughed at   Pretty much a normal Saturday for me  
Yes  
Shit  I'm so sorry about that      I'm in a similar boat  Alone on New Years  It's fucking depressing  and I'm seriously considering drinking a fuck load just to rid these emotions    And I've actually never been drunk before  
Whilst I don't know if you're serious or not I wish you all the best  no matter which way you choose   
Hi lemon   When I know clients I see are having a hard time talking about what happened  and it's nearly always the sexual aspects  I encourage them to keep a journal   It's easier to write down thoughts  feelings  memories  ideas  and let yourself ramble when it's only you   I think one of the reasons online forums can be so helpful is because we are anonymous  which frees you up to write anything   From there  you can begin bringing pieces into your therapist  to look at together  talk about   Sometimes clients will just read to me with a stone face the details of what they went through   Other times  it's just one haunting thought they can't shake   Writing is a great addition to the healing process     I've had clients hand me scribbled notes that say "show this to ChildTherapist" with just a sentence or two on them     Our sexuality and sexual abuse can get very very mixed up together in painful and odd ways   It's sometimes embarrassing to talk about the thoughts and memories we have   Talk with your therapist about what you need to make it safe in the room to say what you need to   Maybe there is something they can do to help you feel safe and contained while you talk   I won't sit here and say you will get past it  but I believe absolutely that you CAN   It's hard and I truly know how much it hurts  but you can move past this and have it be a memory that's less painful   All my best 
Sound advice  but im not even overthinking things  im just in a permanent stage of feeling like shit  and whenever i try to fake feeling good or try engaging myself  even if i can do it for a little bit  it doesnt make me feel like ive achieved anything and i just go back to my original state
Cheers to yet another year

Idk if classifying ERP as "terrifying" is helpful  per se  ERP is the main thing that can help people overcome OCD  it's tough  but a godsend for those that stick with it   Cheers 
Thanks   also  do you know the chances of a 16 year old who doesn't smoke chance at getting lung cancer  
No  c please don't  We have no clue what's in store for 2017  And no one knows what can happen in your life  Maybe you'll make new friends  find a partner  start the right med  have a great experience  discover interests of yours  Please give 2017 a chance  maybe it will make up for the shit of 2016 by being the best year in a while   Please post to  r SuicideWatch and read the side bar if you are considering suicide  Also I'd urge you to call a crisis line  they are amazing and kind people  and they don't judge  People care and your life has so much value  Please stay alive
I totally feel you man  I wish I had some live in my life   I can just hope the best for 2017  U
You sound a lot like me minus the job part but my job isn't really special  Hopefully 2017 will change our luck 
I have so much resentment and jealousy of my older brother  it has taken a toll in our relationship and we've become kind of distant and estranged  He has his life together  is physically fit and knows how to act like a proper adult  And then there's me  a 13 year old girl stuck in the body of a 20 year old man child 
Not a marijuana smoker  but I use CBD oil  The oil can bring me down from a panic attack  It is very relaxing  Marijuana also contains THC  which is psychoactive and will get you high and possibly cause paranoia  CBD is the component that acts opposite of THC in some ways  it alleviates anxiety  Different strains of marijuana will have different effects on anxiety depending on THC to CBD ratios  If I were looking for a strain to help with anxiety  I would look for a higher CBD strain   More info on this topic https   www leafly com news cannabis 101 can cbd undo the anxious side effects of thc
For many of us  life is just one never ending bad day  Every next day day the same as the last  
Thank you    
No worries  It's a busy time of year  All the best to you this New Years 
Im sorry to hear that   merry late christmas to you too and happy new year  Lets hope that 2017 will be better    
Great   Played a bit of Doom   Late last night ran across a improv comedy club doing a NYE show with appetizers and desserts catered and a toast at the 4 marks of NYE in the US   Wavered on it  but really proud that I bought a ticket and am heading out to it in an hour   
I use to watch videos all the time  but then again I'm realizing it's just pointless and a waste of time   Unfortunately there's nothing else for me to do   So yeah
Yeah  im the same way with that  but i still had other aspects of SA back then  But thats actually a good point about the bathroom issue
Ya know I've heard tell of fellas goin off grid  Travelling in search of somethin  We're all searchin for somethin man  For some it's numbers  Others  Well I figure they like words most  Then still others find somethin beautiful in plumbing  I'm figuring on heading out myself  No idea what I'm lookin for either so you ain't alone  Maybe we're lookin for nothin in particular  We're the few  but that just makes us the wild cards ya know  
Hm I guess I can be lucky not to have a sister  especially a sister asking such hurtful questions  u
Seriously  its like our brains embraces them  it doesnt make any sense  Most mental illnesses fuck with your life in many ways  why dont we have some kind of defense mechanism against this 
Home alone on New Years  Blast your favourite music  eat your favourite foods  find chat rooms  and do things you like  such as hobbies  It can still be a good night even if you don't have anyone  Make the most of it  And believe me  the things I recommended can help a ton 
The thing I like the most about your goal of working out is that you said you're doing it for yourself  not specifically to find a partner  People who focus on aesthetics and have the mindset of "I have to get ripped in order to find a SO" usually end up giving up on a routine a month or two in   I had a conversion with my sister's boyfriend one of the nicest  most rational people I've met  over Christmas and his words stuck with me  "Don't do it for anyone but yourself  Do it for your health  do it for your own motivation  A lot of people who don't see progress just give up  Keeping fit is not only good for your body but for your mental well being as well "  It's been a long time since I last had a workout routine  I feel the same way as you because I'm scrawny and feel like everybody's watching me at the gym  I've just started to do calisthenics at home every day for at least 30 minutes  Pop in some tunes while you do it and it will fly by  Once you start to build a routine for yourself and stick with it for a couple weeks it'll start to become second nature 
That's just a very responsible doctor keeping tabs on your son since that is a very high dose  The standard "top" range is 30mg but it doesn't mean that you overdose at doses higher than that  I was on a dose higher than 30mg for a while  Even when I was at 15mg and 20mg my psychiatrist had me in for periodic EKG's just to check things out  Many psych medications can have cardiac implications  it's just kind of the risk many of them have  The class that abilify is in is known for having a small risk of an abnormal rhythm  an abnormal ECG  and sudden low blood pressure when standing up  Those symptoms are not generally super serious but it has caused the medical community to be considerably more cautious about other potential cardiovascular issues that could be present  especially in someone who may not be aware of any underlying issues    It sounds very much like your son's doctor is being responsible  There is no such thing as a "no risk" psych med  There is no "Tylenol" of the psych world  Some antidepressants are fairly benign and have few side effects and people can go about fairly normally with them  Any other class of med in the psychiatric world comes with risk and side effects that are somewhat unpleasant  Usually the illness they are treating is more unpleasant and so we take the meds  Abilify is honestly one of the more tolerable of the bunch  They sort of start getting less desirable from there  
Yes I'm bored I have a headache
Thank you  I appreciate the kind words
That's me
Had the same thoughts earlier today  You aren't alone in this tonight  
Snapchat is worse  Yet I still click through each and every story of people having a good time  
OP you're probably a really chill person and I hope you have a better day tomorrow than you did tonight    If you're in upstate NY you can smoke pot with us
here's a virtual replychug 
I'm doing alright  What about you 
What a positive post under all the negative ones   Happy new year everyone 
I don't think it's over thinking   I think you personally have some issue with someone authentically trying to pay you compliments or interact with you positively   Now  I don't know how people do interact with you  could be that it's really fake and worthless  but it sounds like your boss was truly paying you a compliment honestly  and that you can't accept that   When I got some progress on my SA  it surprised me the kind of people I chose to be around during it   It felt comfortable and good to be with people who weren't really positive  or interacting authentically   It sounds like maybe you have friends who belittle you or at least aren't 100  positive people   It also sounds like you can't speak your true feelings  if you get to the point where you are verbally assaulting them in your head   That is something you ought to talk to someone about and work out   Because you should either be able to handle situations where that happens  or you should feel free to say the things you want to say  or you should be able to pick people to be around who won't treat you like that   Not blaming you for any of it  just saying it sounds like a viewpoint that you'd be much happier healthier working on 
I'm so glad that you are in a better situation   I hope your benefits are sorted out soon   Is there a food pantry you can visit in the mean time     I think you are the only one who can make the right choice about whether to have a baby or not   If that's what you want  I wish you the best   I am not a mother  but hope someday I will be   There are many joys you will find   No one will pretend that there aren't hard times  too  but for people who want kids  the joys far outweigh the challenges     In my case  I am very thankful that I didn't get pregnant   I was extremely careful with birth control  especially after realizing how abusive my abuser was   I'll admit that I was terrified to see his characteristics in my child   I was terrified that nurture might not be able to overcome nature and have no idea which parts of his personality are nature nurture   I truly hope that your child grows up in a loving home and never exhibits any negative characteristics you saw in your ex   I wish you the very  very best   Good luck getting back on your feet   And Congratulations   
For me music is one of those things that can make me feel a little  usually because the song in some small sense can describe how i feel  most of the time i feel pretty numb  
I couldn't have said it better man   
My chances are higher when I control most aspects of their environment  Social aspects   Knowing their wishes  needs  social status  education  and quirks opens social dialogues I can choose from  Certainly some find the challenge difficult if their resources are center around their thoughts  My attempts centers around extracting as much information from them through their friends  families  online info  facebook  twitter  forum or whatever site he she went to   
Why not just stay home 
You know I've always wanted to try improv in a way kinda  I heard it helped with social anxiety  
I kinda don't get it either  
Haha my problems arn't as bad as yours but yeah my bestfriend left me for a guy  I was there when she needed me but when she got a bf i was second best never there for me  Still hurts and I feel shitty btw dont want to compare just sharing my story    haha If you want someone to talk to just message me  I like talking to people that are struggling like me hopefully ur year changes around or else    jk haha
Don't worry  some jokes bomb it's totally cool  As long as you make yourself laugh it's fine  But then again  it's a lot easier said than done 
With number 4 I honestly stopped giving a shit  Surprisingly I am decent at talking to others but I will never approach them  I simply don't feel like it  Instead I choose to spend my time reading things or daydreaming to my music  I figure like either my pills will make me feel better enough to  want  to talk to others or I'll be alone for a long time  cope as best I can  maybe suicide  I honestly feel as if I don't really care since my days may be numbered  More importantly though  I enjoy not forcing myself to do anything I don't want to do 
OP is on Long island     Thanks for the offer 
Take a breath  List things you want to do and don't want to do  Then make a plan 
That's tough   I've been avoiding all my friends for the past few months because they're doing things with their lives  They've got jobs they're going to school  And here I am  Doing nothing  Just hang in there buddy it'll get better for all of us 
r raisedbynarcissists    What assbags threaten to throw out their sons' things goddamn 
I haven't heard of TMS  but I will look into it now  But yeah those side effects sound pretty drastic  and with a lack of permanence  sounds pretty terrible  
I feel you  I guess my life is even worse than yours  but I don't have any real "friends" either  It sucks and much of the stuff I do is just pointless and a waste of time  I don't know what 2017 will bring but I guess I have to keep my head up  
I understand you  Not on everything  but a lot  I understand the hiding and keeping you're head down and just feeling dreadful because of school  I'm in my last year   Sigh    Do you have Kik  We chat here if not  but I'd like to chat on Kik so I can know when you've replied  My Kik is idkwhattoputhere     
It really sucks losing a best friend    Hang in there mate  You should really consider talking about this with people  Maybe reconnect with your friends  I find that whenever I'm feeling really dark and gloomy  talking about it always helps  Therapy is helpful  if you get a therapist you connect with 
Hello     Firstly  I would like to say that I am incredibly sorry that this was the opening to the new year  It sucks  I'm sending virtual hugs  you must be having a very tough time    Secondly  I'm a disabled person physically  mentally too but my physical illness is invisible  and I believe that people who have depression have the exact same rights to claim disability as people who are disabled physically  Think about this that way  I get money because I can't work due to spinal pain  you can't work due to mental pain  But pain is pain  no matter what form  Please  please don't feel bad about claiming disability allowance     I believe that your parents are doing the right thing by splitting up if they're unhappy however  I completely understand how that would affect you on a deeply emotional level  And while I haven't been through this  my best friend has and I promise you that it's not as bad as it seems  They'll be happier  and soon  you will too   I think that you should take time to grieve  you have every right to be upset  Don't let this define the upcoming year for you  It'll be like any other year  it'll have its ups and downs but in majority of events you still get to turn it around    I hope I haven't said anything that will upset you  I wish you all the best  I know everything is super tough right now but it won't stay like this    If you need anyone to talk to at any stage  feel free to pm me   
I noticed but just did what I do every day  ignoring the fireworks outside  
you're the first person in this thread to comment on my writing  thank you
No wins for me  My crippling anxiety and depression worsened  I have suicidal ideation weekly now  I go to bed each night picturing what the people around me will think when I die  Thinking about 2017 makes me want to vomit  I have to drop out of college soon too  
Haha your  just shy no need to be ashamed he probably finds it cute as fuck  One day you'll find the courage  Plus if he really likes you  He wont mind waiting so you know he's a keeper    You'll kiss when your comfortable no need to rush it  Good Luck I believe in you 
Caffeine is definitely one of my go tos  But I also take Effexor  damn though they are throwing everything at you  has it been helping    
Okay a few things 1  Come as Gay or Bi if you are still unhappy  or more  You are straight    Even though I have done that and I still pointless worry about it 2  You are aroused by gay porn this could be bc          You have a serious porn addiction  so bad that the acts that degrading  fucked up acts these men are doing arouse you          OR you are genuinely bi but I highly doubt that   DO THIS   STOP MASTURBATING OR WATCHING PORN FOR A FEW WEEKS    A MONTH THEN GO BACK TO THE GAY PORN YOU WERE WATCHING AND SEE IF YOU ARE STILL AROUSED   if you aren't the brain circuits that allowed to be aroused by the gay porn should be gone by then if not and you are still aroused you might be bisexual    IF YOU HAVE CONTEMPLATED SUICIDE BC OF THESE THOUGHTS YOU ARE NOT GAY   THINGS TO DO TO HELP COPE AND OVERCOME    Exercise     Improve your diet     THERAPY         make some friends        some real friends you can actually talk to about this   NoFap    Talk to Women    Meditation    And no matter what deny every "am I gay" thought   after you come out as bi gay if you are still unhappy   
Thank you      Happy new year 
Reword Drugs with Alcohol and thats me xD
Your not alone btw m8 
Thanks
I feel for you so much  At the beginning of this year a group that I had trusted and thought of as friends all turned their back on me  Now the one person I thought I had left to trust now is off celebrating with them  I know it's petty jealousy but being alone sucks  
I feel it  just tried to spend some time with the folks  dad got offended by how I smoke my cig  near violence ensued  had to leave 
Haha I feel the same as you  Listen to NF Paralyzed  I think this should describe you 
What chat rooms 
Yup pretty much this
I hope you can change your perspective  We all have our ups and downs but what makes life beautiful is that we have Both  There's a lot of good in this world and I wish you the best in finding it  I know it's a battle  You can do it  
Yeah but seeing all those Snapchat stories of people having fun sucks  u
Speak to your parents buddy   Approximately 9 hours ago  I was feeling very  very down and suicidal  about total misunderstandings and misreading things that were said happened over Christmas  I was racking my brain for hours  how I was going to ask my brother about those things that had been plaguing me since then  I got it into my head that my brother would kick off on the phone  saying something like "how dare you think of us like that "  He caught me off guard whilst I was planning what to say  and he phoned me  so just said what I had to say  but asked him not to be angry before hand  I also explained that what I had to ask him may seem trivial even stupid   You know what buddy   It turns out that neither him  his wife or their son meant the things that I though they had  with the way they looked at me when I said whatever  or what they meant when they said whatever   And I'm 44  and it's still very difficult for me  But don't let that make you think that it's all gonna be bad  even by my age  Chances are it won't  Hang in there and tell your parents   I have Asperger's  and so  social situations are extremely difficult for me   In the end  all was sorted  I apologised  and we said "happy New Year" to each other  and with that said  that saw the end of 2016   Don't worry about a phone  I know you don't know me  but I have shit loads of spare phones if you want one  You matter  not material objects  They  in time can be replaced  you can't 
That's terrible  certainly not worthy of best friend title  You deserve better OP   Happy new year buddy 
Man   life sucks  it's true   but we've managed to endure it   and I'm content if I have to suffer for the remainder of time I am here  them let it be  even if everything might get worse  I still know we are far stronger than others  feath will do us apart either way  even if this demise is permanent  I can't change your or my destiny and I know this text wont do shit about it  there's still the possibility shit can work out  it might wont  but fuck it  what if it works out  Life is a shit hole  but will it be for the remainder  Even if it is the smallest of chances  I think we can live for a few more moments 
Trying not to weigh too heavy on my SO  She's so supportive  but she doesn't deserve to put up with me every day  so I'm attempting to make conversation on r baseball and take my mind off things  It's going meh  
Life sucks  I go on impulse buying sprees which i always regret and end up getting refunds for  essentially wasting time  and everything is just shit  My family is disappointed in me  and I have no idea what I want to do with my life  I have no passion or drive to do anything that would sustain a healthy living  I want to fucking die  but I'm too much of a coward to do it  
I feel for you buddy  I'm a recovered alcoholic  It does get easier 
Just drifting in this turbulent sea called life  oh so weary of everything  drenched  tired  starving  pointless   Wild cards eh  I always loved wild card characters  no obligations to alliance  mostly lone rangers  probably weirdos 
Yeah I agree with what your saying  I guess I'm stuck on her because we have two kids together and so much history  I've done so much for her from getting her any car she wanted cash in hand along with a house that she picked out and putting food on the table along with a roof over our heads  I know she wants me back I really do but like you said with the ice cream she doesn't know what flavor she wants  Its hard on me because I have no family they are back in Jersey and I'm in Texas and to top it off with a bang my mom passed away on new years day of 09 and its gonna be a tough on tonight  Ill take your word for it bro but its hard to cope with this problem then she wants to fuck me and tell me how she feels and then next day back with the other dude that she said she loves   You cant love some one that damn quick  But hey she's kinda fucked in the head  I made a mistake that I cant take back I wished the worst on her and came back she has some type of cancer and I feel so bad now  I hate being such a nice guy and getting treated like shit  why cant girls respect men like us 
Wow this song is perfect for me honestly thanks man  i still feel so nervous every time i post something on this website i never know what im saying is right  but every time i get a response it gives me a little hope

I'm dependent on the government for living needs  I am unable to work or go to school presently  and it's likely to be permanent disability  So if there's a giant change to medicare or otherwise  I won't be able to afford my medication which is what keeps me from hearing voices and being intensely depressed as often  I'm scared of the sounds coming back  the psychosis    I know it's not real but it's scary and I don't want to be in that place again

Take a nap  smoke a bowl  maybe even go workout or something    Do whatever you can to be some sort of busy    People suck and the can easily be replaced    Image Time  Reality  If you want to not be depressed do what you see not depressed people do   It'll feel fake and unvoluntary at first but that's natural    I'm not an expert at this but keeping yourself busy in some way or another is super important to your well being in there situations    You can PM me if you want someone to talk to 
Has she sought help  Just out of curiosity  That could be one way to help with the behaviors of OCD  but I understand if that's just not an option    Coming from someone with OCD  I can't even imagine how annoying I am to people around me when I act out  I know that people like my boyfriend and my mom love me  but I'm sure they get sick of how I am  So know you're probably not alone    But  also   maybe try to be more understanding and give her some leeway  It's possible she lashes out because she already feels bad  or maybe even shameful  about her compulsions  and she doesn't know how to communicate that to you  I know I lash out against those close to me when I'm having a panic attack or in the middle of a compulsion just because I'm already feeling bad about myself and my OCD  and if someone says something negative to me about it  it just adds fuel to the fire   Also  be communicative with her and let her know how you're feeling  but also that you're here for her to come to  I had to learn how to communicate how I was feeling with my OCD  and my mom had to lean when to step back and say   ok  I don't know what you're going through  but I'm here  So it's a two way street    Good luck

There's also the trauma aspect to it  which is that my abusive father talked a lot like him  and I can easily get PTSD issues just hearing that voice  So it's hard for me to feel remotely safe when you have someone who's so close to my abuser  in power   In this case a pres instead of a cop and dad though  I just    don't feel safe and haven't felt safe since then  and because of the hate crimes  I might not be black or otherwise  but I'm afraid of what people would do if they knew I was disabled and autistic  I want to feel stable  and safe again  But if this is the wrong place to vent about something I'm deeply terrified of  then I'm sorry 
Please don't mate  I was feeling the exact same way in June last year  I now am thankful that I didn't do it 
Thank you

Yo there is no right or wrong answer when you post on here  Imo its just to blow some anger or how you feel  Just say what u want no ones going to judge u on this subreddit because everyone feels shitty  And if they do there just a troll 
The way I see it is  if someone doesn't have my phone number or I didn't contact them before leaving to set up another means of contact   we weren't talking often enough to be tight friends anyways   You have no room in your life for acquaintances  you're so much better 
And just listening for me makes me feel even worse  unless im directly involved i can get no joy out of it
I hope you don't mate  I'm a recovered alcoholic  I was feeling suicidal six months ago  and I'm glad I didn't do it

Happy New Year to you both  so cute
I really want to also   I listen to a bunch of improv podcasts and they are often the funniest part of my week   I actually found this show tonight because I met some people who took classes at the theater  and remembered that I meant to check out classes starting in January   They are all booked  but found the show tonight so at least have something to do   Hopefully it's awesome and I can see about taking classes in April   But I also think Improv to many of us SAers is like the deep part of the pool   We spend so much time censoring  planning  prepping  evaluating  that just speaking off the cuff isn't something we have the ability to do   Not sure if this will help in that regards  or if it'll just reinforce it   People here have said it helped them a lot 
You're in an abusive relationship with it  it hurts you but you keep going back  You are above it  it's not easy to let go but you'll feel so much freer 
I feel you both  I can't remember a time my PTSD and depression have acted up this much  It's really making me hate the holidays

I think that you're really right that all of our "existential crises" don't mean that we can't be happy  Maybe life's meaningless   maybe there's no God   maybe nothing is right or wrong   maybe all of those things are true  But that doesn't mean that we can't be happy  and find a way to enjoy the time that we have  Of course  that can be hard too  but I'd like to think it really is possible for us  all the same   Happy 2017 to you too  and thanks for the words of encouragement

I always get my hopes up that things will be better  But then quickly come back down to reality 
I've used so called "legal" CBD before   If you don't live in a state where cananbis is legal  then the CBD products available to you are derived from industrial hemp for the most part   Most of that is imported from China and is complete garbage   Having said that  I have used CBD oil drops and it did have a positive effect without making me too drowsy   However  after about a year it stopped working   I don't know if I developed a tolerance or if what I was using turned to crap  imported from china   If you live in a legal state  then get to a dispensary and try some of the good stuff   Forget about the headshop crap   For more information  visit  r cbd    A useful alternate to CBD is Kava   It works on the GABA receptors much like alcohol and xanax  but without most of the negative side effects     I can take it in the morning and still have a productive day   Buy ground kava powder only  the extracts and pills should be avoided as you don't know what kind of kava was used to make them   Kava generally comes in three forms   ground root powder  micronized powder  more finely ground and prepared root   and instant   Kava is normally prepared as a drink  but it is very nasty tasting and can numb your mouth   You can fill gelcpas with instant and micronized kava as an alternative     I have been using Kava for a couple of years now and this shit works  as effective as CBD if not more so    It's not strong enough to stop a full panic attack once it comes on  but it works rather well as a daily preventative   To try it out  I recommend the instant sample pack for Gourmet Hawaiian Kava     Visit  r kava for vendor info and recommendations  
The only thing we can count on are that things will remain awful

You're shooting yourself in the foot saying 2017 isn't going to be good when not even the whole world is on Jan 1 yet    You say you'll be disappointed with all that you won't accomplish then go on to say you're just going to do nothing and waste time  How can you be disappointed when you give absolutely zero effort  Disappointment is reserved for actual let downs  not things that don't miraculously go well    Yes  you can't just push your depression aside and kick ass like no one's business  but you have to try  something   Depression wants you to do nothing because that's what it feeds on  and the longer you sit and sulk  the worse it'll get    You need to reveal your worth to yourself  You have potential  don't waste it telling yourself it's not enough  People will tell you time and time again that you're worth it  but it's not this depressed version that has worth  The person you  could  be if you set every fiber of your being on 'Go' is worth it  You  can  do great things  but you need to see that you're capable   I hope the first part of my message didn't put you off  I know what's it like to be depressed beyond belief  but imo the worst thing I  or anyone  could do is feel sorry for you  
I'm still dealing with it  The key for my successes thus far is acceptance and thought segregation  I first had to accept that these thoughts are a part of me  just thankfully not the "true" me  I am truly not attracted to children  but I have to accept that thoughts about it is a part of me  That acceptance is the key to conditioning your brain to have have the fear reaction  That's the basis of ERP therapy   Those first couple hours  days  weeks of the acceptance are so hard   It feels so wrong and counter intuitive  which in reality shows you are not what you fear you are    Then the segregation part  I identify my OCD thoughts as  "Scumbag Brain"  It allows me to sort of disassociate from the OCD thoughts and keep them separate from my conscious  real thoughts   Aside from that I am also on a low dose of Cymbalta for my OCD and Vyvanse for my ADHD  My understanding is that Cymbalta doesn't really help with the thoughts themselves until high doses  but it helps me deal with them due to less depression and more balanced brain chemistry

So sooty for your loss mate  I still grieve after my dad whom died 28 years ago
Lexapro is my wonder drug  I thought I'd try something else in September  long story  so my doctor prescribed Trintellex   Didn't work   So then we switched to Effexor XR  and that didn't help  So I asked to go back on my Lexapro  Within a week I am feeling better  I am eating at least one  sometimes two  decent meals a day again  I  totally  related to what you wrote about how food is repugnant right now  My sleep isn't completely back  I wake up with high anxiety  so my doctor has prescribed Klonopin to help with that until the Lexapro kicks in more  Klonopin is slower to act  but it lasts in the system a bit longer  I take the Klonopin before bed  so it gets me through the night and the first part of the day  and then I usually relax as I start my routine  I take Lexapro in the AM        Hugs    
I have also found that alcohol and or Opiates WRECK my thoughts for about a week  It feels like I'm starting all over after each time I drink or take a Vicodin for my back pain  Time to make some adjustments I guess 
That should have read "so sorry for your loss"

I know how you feel  I often feel that way to  I feel like whenever I say something that I think is important to me concerning  people seem to chalk it up to my depression or my anxiety  It's very frustrating  I'm sorry that they make you feel that way too  I know it's not much  but if it's any consolation you're not alone 3  Do they know that you are depressed

I'm not saying you're doing this  but just see if the following rings true   If your understanding of exercise  currently  only encompasses certain kinds of activities  or certain intensities  especially grueling workouts   you might think all exercise feels really bad  A lot of new exercisers jump in with good expectations but end up doing too much too soon  and it hurts  It's sweaty and uncomfortable and then you're sore the next day  Why does anyone like feeling like that    Because if you stick with it  and or  if you alter your definition of exercise to include lower intensity activities  https   www researchgate net publication 51513210 The Pleasure and Displeasure People Feel When they Exercise at Different Intensities Decennial Update and Progress towards a Tripartite Rationale for Exercise Intensity Prescription   it starts feeling good for almost everyone  Maybe not during the time you're exercising  but that's okay  Exercise in different forms is a pleasure for some people and a chore for others  But I firmly believe that  exercise is a necessary component of good mental and physical health     It saddens me that a lot of people don't exercise because they think exercise only means one thing  and they don't like that one thing  usually that thing is the gym   I always tell my patients to pick a lower intensity activity if they are having trouble with exercise adherence  If running means pain and sweat and breathlessness to you  why not try walking instead  If lifting weights is not your cup of tea  could you commit to home bodyweight exercises  Or home yoga videos  Do you enjoy a hobby that you might not have previously considered to be exercise  like gardening  The light exercise you will do is always better than the vigorous exercise you won't    I would really encourage you to try making a habit of any kind of daily activity that seems doable to you  It can sound daunting  but it doesn't have to be  
somehow I am unsure if I keep going because I'm stupid  
But I never wanna be skilled  I just wanna sleep

Glad it worked for you long term  It seemed to stop working for me  though my powder has been exposed to air for abit too long  it could have degraded  Did it eventually resolve your Anhedonia 
Actually the hospital may allow you to cut off contact   Or encourage it   Its a pretty outstanding perk if your in the mood to be left alone 
There's a speech called "everybody's free to wear sunscreen"  it helped me alot when I was younger  In particular  one line   "don't feel guilty if you don't know what you want to do with your life  Some of the most interesting people I know didn't know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives  some of the MOST interesting 40 year Olds I know still dont  "     It sounds like you do care about people  You care about hurting them and what they think of you    you suffer for them  It sounds like you care     Just trust me  nobody is good at anything or really has fun hobbies at 18  Everyone goes around thinking about how everyone must have things figured out  when really nobody does    We all don't exist for a reason  but instead because we can  Things can change    
I would say something super bold to them  Like "have you thought maybe I'm mentally ill and need help instead of teasing " 
Mhm  in terms of grades I actually just try to get positive grades on the tests so I can finish school and my apprenticeship   I'm sorry you're under pressure from the people around you   Maybe you should take a couple days off  Do you have any holidays    Thank you and yeah  if 2017 does better a tiny bit that would be great
I wish I were out at a bar or party  But I'm completely lonely at home  No one has texted me in over a week  I don't know how my life got this way  I try so hard to connect with others but I guess I am just completely forgettable

Man sometimes i wonder how we evolved that much with these inneficient brains 
yes
I remember it is not happening now
I was underweight when I took it  The psychiatrist I saw at the time said that it would either help or do nothing   pretty low risk medication   so I'm glad it's working for someone    
Is there something your doctor can prescribe to help out with that  I understand what you shared  though  I get so discouraged when I can't sleep through the night  I try not to worry about how it will affect my day later on  but I do  My doctor prescribed klonopin  taken at night  to relax me enough to keep me asleep and keep my anxiety lower in the morning  when it tends to be its highest   Klonopin is longer acting than Xanax or Ativan  Once my Lexapro becomes fully functional  I shouldn't need the klonopin  
I really dislike it when people say that being a relationship won't change anything  I'm sorry you had difficulties while being in a relationship  but saying that your experience is proof that it doesn't work for anyone else is just plain wrong  What doesn't work for you might work out for someone else  Be more understanding to the people who are suffering from depression  it's not the same for everyone    
Happy new year    I hope life gets better for you   
Is that a maltess  I have 3 of them  
Puts me to sleep in 25min 
Man  I feel shit most of the time  I manage to medicate  or numb with alcohol or other shit  but I dont want others to suffer for because of me  sometimes however  the suffering can be overwhelming  for me
 r BreakUps 
Me too  Even when I do feel intense urges to end it  I still have this thought saying "what if"  Maybe if I hold out then things will somehow get better one day

That's fantastic to hear  I think Lexapro and Citalopram are pretty similar  But it's so good to hear that you've had bad reactions and still found something that works for you  And sleeping and eating  I'll ask about Klonopin   I'm about to make a smoothie and see if drinking instead of eating helps  but so far today I've eaten half a poptart and some apple sauce  Ugh

Very remote  with no previous diagnosis of any cancer and not smoking  pretty much  100 chance it is a correctable or manageable issue  Once you have those tests done and know what it is the worry should subside  you can get any help you need and not fear the unknown 
Happy new year  We'll be all right 
Same to you too    
Have you tried calling a hotline  
Yeah mate fucked up New Years with this girl  she's coming around I'm hoping to set things right  not optimistic though
 removed 
Yes  smoothies are good  I also will drink chicken broth or protein drinks  Atkins   I like yogurt and applesauce  too  Occasionally I can manage to eat some buttered toast  As long as I am getting some nutrients  I feel successful  I try not to weigh myself because seeing the scale go down down down increases my panic a bit  Hang in there  You are not alone

I used to at least like things   I dont like or love anything anymore  not for years   tell me what you despise

Hey OP  you're awesome too  I hope you all have a happy new year or a new year with plans for change  
Very true  I've tried to change things  hasn't worked  I'm going to start over  I'm scared and it won't be perfect  but better than what I've been doing  I hope it gets better for you in 2017    
That's because we try to not scream in front of others   Trust me I have a LOT of mom friends and 99  of us struggle   Yes I remember that show   Love Lois  
Probably  once you start liking someone  you find more reasons to like them and you are less likely to see flaws as well 
YES        It's Always Sunny always makes me laugh so hard  Charlie Day is actually from my home town  One of my favorite episodes ever is the Reynolds VS Reynolds one    "Oh Sandra  you dumb bitch " 
I have done the online chat hotline because I was scared of calling and I'm making mistakes with what I've done sure  but I'm trying to improve soon  I'm planning on Starting therapy
I live with my parents so I'm not completely alone tonight  But I wish I were  I hate having to explain to them all the time why I don't go out and stay at home in my room  I 100  understand what you mean about feeling like an outsider  No one seems to remember me when plans are made  Or maybe they purposefully exclude me  I don't know but it is hurtful  Nobody ever texts me first and if I don't message them  we don't talk  Literally no one has texted or called me in over a week  I crave true friendship and relationships and feel like I have a lot to offer but no one will give me a chance  I daydream all the time of what it is like to have best friends and a boyfriend and to actually have fun experiencing life with them  Obviously this takes a toll on my self esteem  It makes me feel inferior in many different aspects of my life    work  school  etc  I don't even see myself as lovable anymore    I hear all these people say to give up and get used to being alone but I don't want to do that  I won't make it the rest of my life this way  I am only 22  If things don't change I don't know how I will cope    I am sorry to go on this long rant but it has really been weighing on me too lately  I hope we both can find some answers and make some changes in 2017  Hope you have a happy new year  
It's sad because i know i have the potentional to do stuff  I just never go at the "start signal"  My mind know that i can go  just move and shit will get done  But it just won't happen  time and time again that has happened  I sit idly as opportunities pass by me as i wish  "i could have done that" while im seeing the chance to kickstart something new slip me by  This thought might be arrogant or simply disrespectful towards other hardworking people   But I know because i have watched it many times and i know that it's inevitably going to happen again  Im not trying to brag of my "superior intellect" and such but i do think i am generally smart or rather just have an easy time learning things  I just feel my motivation draining and nothing gets done  The only productive things that happen is the things i have to do to keep my status as a functional member of society    This is just some incoherent rambling but i hope i have conveyed my message in some meaningful way  And no  you did not put me off with any of this  im always open for new perspectives  or i hope i am  I know this is a sad attempt to make people feel sorry for me and im not requiring anything from anybody  Just wanted to vent a bit in a disgraceful manner 
Try it  It didn't work for me after 8 weeks at 40mg  but has helped others  I didn't have many negative effects other than slight decreased appetite for a week or two and increased anxiety   Often SSRI SSNI cause anxiety before it calms it

It can't be worse either  No matters how bad it gets  at least you have someone who smiles to you everyday  We  the single  lonely people  don't have that

I would like to argue that feeling alone but not being supported by loved ones is caused by not being supported by yourself and supporting yourself by joining a crowd of supportive people  aka getting back in there   the work doesn't get rid of the feeling of heartbreak  especially if it's solitary work  I had this feeling during a nightshift and it felt like implosion
Thank you very much  I have been thinking of trying Ritalin instead of the Dexedrine Vyvanse which my Doctor prefers 
 removed 
Yeah we all support you just tell us what's wrong we'll help they've done the same for me it helps makes things clearer
You will get over this  Depression is rough  You are going to feel like you will never be well again  but that's just the depression talking  Try to seek some help from a therapist and or a psychiatrist  Wishing the best for you  
I know it may seem like nobody cares but what if they really do 
You think it helps but it doesn't    It doesn't help when I can't even take care of myself let alone someone else 
Or you could go my way I planned on telling them just go see a counselor tell them and have them tell you're parents explain you're concerns about their reaction
same thing for me  My best friend got back with his ex and suddenly he doesn't seem to put as much effort in our relationship as he used to    it's destroyed me
I get what your saying  I get bothered because I'll have racial slurs in my head even with my own race 
I'm glad you are starting therapy  that's what helped me when I was really depressed  Do you think you'll be able to hang in there until you see a therapist  
Well if they do then they have never showed it
Be brave because I'm trying the same there are millions of us Depressed teens you can do it
I'm ready for a fresh start  I've started off the year well  After this post  I got a few really nice and supportive messages from my friends  
Wow  This really hit home  I ceased to do that  I  Know i should be doing this but I put it off
Don't hurt yourself try to get help and heal
I feel similarly to you  I am probably in better conditions though  My recommendation to you would be to start small  I started with simple goals day by day to achieve    Last few weeks the goals has been to do four things immediately after waking up  I mean literally as soon as I am aware I am awake  I do this    See the sun   Make the bed   Shower   Have breakfast    I do this within an hour    It has had a significant improvement to my mental state and how I feel about every day  More optimistic  more motivated    So again  my advice is start small   
The love for seroquel concerns me  mostly due to it being illegally marketed by drug reps  http   abcnews go com Politics Health astrazeneca pay 520 million illegally marketing seroquel schizophrenia story id 10488647    Maybe I am paranoid an unduly suspicious  but say  if a Psychiatrist had to come to the realization that they had been 'suckered' by drug reps  could that make themselves dig their feet in further  Insisting that they had not been suckered  that the drug reps spoke truths  Nobody likes to be suckered  
I can't tell anymore which year is the worst  They all suck  
Welcome  Sorry for the late reply  I was dealing with alot this weekend  Woah that ones been hitting me alot  what if i don't have ocd  I've been getting alot of "kill myself" thoughts as well as thoughts of whether " what if im straight and The attraction and thoughts I have towards girls is a intrusive thought instead"  I am bisexual btw 
I will soon 
Hello   Of course this post belongs here   It's great you are in therapy   I often lose my temper due to anxiety   I try to be aware of it so I can proactively control myself   I have three children and they don't deserve it   Have you tried medication   I recently started lexapro and I think it's helping   What about exercise  meditation  yoga 
Nope  I tried to tell them  but it's hard 
First I would like to say I am very sorry that this person you thought was a friend has turned out to be a piece of shit and a scumbag and is taking advantage of you  I would also like to say that it's not your fault  He knew that you were in a bad place mentally and he was the one who took advantage of that for his own sick gain  You are not diminishing rape or sexual assault by posting this  What happened to you is STILL a form of sexual assault and you are absolutely allowed to feel violated  He had also  from what you have written  threatened you  Do you still have the messages he sent you where he said he could "make your life a living hell"  If you do  save those  I would advise taking legal action  if you want to  It is ultimately your decision  and if you do  absolutely keep those messages from him as evidence  Nobody has the right to do this to you  nor do they have the right to threaten you like this  
Go ahead man  I'm here  
Get out there man  If you feel like your parents or friend dont really care about you or appreciate you  get out there and find new people  Go to a concert  an art show  an auction house and see what they have  go to a museum  Anywhere really  Just get your mind distracted from those thoughts   And If you want to talk about anything Pm me anytime  
Do you have a date  Can you stay alive until you see your therapist  
This year has gone from terrible to horrible  I have nearly nobody to turn to  especially in my times of need  I only have one good friend now  but a single person can't be here all the time  Childhood fucked me up and now I'm here loathing myself  knowing next year will be even worse than this one  and feeling like all I want is attention so I won't let myself make a post 
I like to think every natural disaster is Earth's immune system trying get rid of the the cancer  Humans 
Why were these helpful comments deleted  It seems like  r anxiety has a religious agenda  I feel like this should be addressed  
Yeah  social media on weekends and nights like this is the fucking worst  Really makes you feel left out and just generally lonely  I've been chilling with my dog tonight  he's a pretty good bud to have around when no one else is
They're just saying enjoy this shit while it last  they care they just suck at showing it 
It's REALLY dumb but the only things that have managed to get through to me in the last few months and genuinely make me laugh is the situation on the TLC show Love at First Kiss with Josh  and the Kitchen Nightmares clip "You don't microwave a salad"   I don't even know what it was  they're not what I'm generally amused by  but I laughed like crazy for the first time in forever    
fuck this the time of the year that makes us feel like fuckin loners

Oh it sucks that there is such a wide range of side effects that we are willing to tolerate over others  It is hard to draw the line  Tardive dyskinesia  or obesity  Sleep all day  or perhaps some kidney failure    I hate that it is so difficult to discern what exactly is causing the weight gain  Like you  when I am manic I am up all hours  my body clock is all disturbed  Food is also far tastier than usual    I so wish that I only needed to take these medications in short term crises periods  I find withdrawing from them so painful and frightening about relapse makes it so much worse  
Thank you 
It's worse because least a job I can quit and find a new one  but I only have this life 
I really can't help you directly unfortunately  but what thought have you put into why you just let opportunities pass you by  You're smart but evidently not driven to succeed  For some  maybe a lot  of people like that  they let life pass them by because it's easier to 'not do' than to fail  but we all take our lumps  The only way to get through life without failing is to do nothing  but that in itself is the biggest failure of all    You may never become a pro ball player  the top lawyer at your firm  the most exciting guy in the room or what have you  but if you look down these paths then start to wander down them  you'll eventually find yourself playing catch with your son  teaching him about justice and doing the right thing  and making your friends or SO's eyes light up when you walk into a room    Along the way  you'll catch a ball to the face  get swamped with paperwork  and embarrass yourself trying to make someone laugh  but hell  will it be worth it to actually  live   I hope you eventually find the answer is yes  but I understand that putting in the effort needed for just a chance at happiness is daunting  There's a lot to overcome and you won't do it in one big leap then tomorrow will be all peachy  Baby step after baby step will take you miles if you don't quit   
So what was her excuse for not making lunch   
I just keep blowing up silently to myself when these annoying assholes expecting me to give them shit for free 
I didn't actually hurt myself tonight  dark humor only  I've stopped and am seeing a therapist about that  Thank you for the concern though 
I got High off of brownies and had intrusive thoughts  However  while high I don't tend to respond to thoughts and remain extremely calmed  This caused me to panic and now I'm anxious again  But thank you so much for replying
Believe me you're not the only one alone  Gonna smoke  drink and play some video games to keep my mind off shit  Are there any shows you like to binge  You could get in your pajamas  make some popcorn and make it a party    Now  more than ever  it's important to remind yourself to be kind to yourself  Forget it's New Years if you have to  I hope you do take care of yourself  You deserve happiness just as much as the next person  
Happy New Year 
You need to stop trying and start living  Stop seeking for acceptance and accept yourself 
I put it off too  but I think if the habit gets started it will continue and become just part of your day  I have more intrusive thoughts that I didn't mention and really feel that the journaling will help 
I asked a few people if they wanted to hang out  most of them were going out with other friends  and didn't bother to invite me  So guess I'll just be sitting in my room  lol  
I can totally understand where she is coming from  Her boys are just out of control and full of trouble since birth and she is just overwhelmed and these are not your average boys  
I'm in a similar situation  Stuck in a rut  Go to the doctor  a therapist  someone  There are people who will listen  I picked out a random friend from way back in high school and he has helped me through just talking out the feelings   Day by day it gets better  but I still see the pain on my wife's face when I start to slide back down into the depression   Just remember this  You are not alone  Those 2 family members care about you  Talk to them  It would mean the world to them  That you would bring it to their attention  
I mainly do edibles  I usually chill then eventually fall asleep if i'm alone  I used to be against any usage of substances until I tried it  really helped to calm my nerves  Just general tips if you do deicide to try it  be careful not to overindulge as edibles take longer to work and drink a shit ton of water unless you want dry mouth  don't make the same mistake as me
Hey I agree I used to feel this way   but now I realize I kinda do it to myself   Like I don't go out of my way to talk to people or hang  Even when I get invited places I normally turn it down so at some point people just stop inviting you to do things  It's hard because 99  of the time I want to be alone but the one percent I wanna do something I can't find people to hangout with   Also check out the song by die antwoord   alien  you may relate to it I know I do 
not really into shows but thanks 
I came to terms with what I have done and how I got to this level of depression   I did as you did   Bottled up emotions from work  irritations personally  etc  til an incident with some family broke me   Now I know my problem and am working on being a bit more open

I totally understand  I recently went through a breakup and all our plans for the New Year went down the drain  I don't have a lot of friends and almost none that I hang out with on a regular basis  This didn't bother me in the past  but now that I no longer have a girlfriend I'm really feeling the void  Don't feel worthless though  I am having the same battle right now and I just keep reminding myself that I'm not worthless  that I am loved  and that maybe next year will be better  Also  your English is really good  The only real mistakes I saw were that you used feel  present tense  instead of felt  past tense  and want  present tense  instead of wanted past tense  when describing how your brother felt pity for you  
Fuck 2016 and those people  I hope you find happiness in the new year

Yay  Fake smiles and selfies everywhere
I related to a lot of what you are saying  especially the part about being tired  I'm sorry you are dealing with all of that  I will listen to you if you have anything to say  
This year was exhausting    Happy New Year  folks   may it be kind to you all  
Nah  it isn't that it's not smart  There is nothing wrong with trying  and I'm sorry it didn't work out for you   I think you will find something you can connect to someone else with  Maybe I can tell you about an experience I had tonight   I went out for a new years party for a bit tonight  I never planned to stay too long  but I'm glad that I went even if I didn't leave really happy  or really drunk   It was still an experience  But anyway  I met a guy there  It seemed like we took a few college classes together a few years ago  I didn't feel interested in him in THAT way  but I kind of saw that he seemed sad  I've been feeling sad too and  I dunno  I just kind of wanted someone to talk to about something REAL  I was interested in helping him too  not just venting for my own sake    But  in the end  he choose to go with a girl for sex  And that is all right  we didn't even barely become acquaintances  And  if that's what he wanted tonight  that's okay  There is nothing wrong with it   I'm   bummed that I didn't get to make a  potentially  significant friendship   Sorry  this was probably something I just want to vent talk about a bit and I kinda seized this opportunity  but it isn't totally unrelated to your story I think   Even though my experience didn't have the result I hoped for either  my point is that it is so likely you'll see something  that something might click when you meet someone  You've been through a lot in your life  I bet  Maybe you'll see someone  a girl  she has this look about her that you recognize  You'll think  "yeah  I've been there"  You'll want to talk to her   You've been through a hurt  and I bet you'd want something substantial  too  Something that means something  even if it isn't romantic  I hope we can both find it 
I don't understand why you're bitching at me  I  only said that I'm tired of hearing the same bogus advice from people who don't understand what it's like to be unloved    And I never said my problems stemmed from a relationship  quite the opposite  my depression comes partially from never getting to be in a relationship    Also  I'm not fucking harassing depressed people  You are  Go the fuck away  Nobody needs your bitchiness  
Thanks  good timing reading this
Thanks
Its because they dont know how to help 
It's okay  man 
You'll be okay 
Me either   Im pretty sure I havent been to work in a while   I thought things would be different   I thought if rhings were hard i'd have to be some kind of vagabond like a soldier or police officer   Butnits so kich worse I just have this job and that job  and its always so doable   I can do this job that I don't want to do   And another year goes by    The very idea of a hint of dignity is old fashioned   I am so lucky to work and to have an even half way good job   And let me stop me right ther  because I am so lucky   And isn't some Algerian dude depresswd his father wont acknoledge he is due some wealth from some oil wells   I met a guy in this position  lord lnows what became of him   Anyway  I lost my train of thought   But I lnow some people are happy   People of my age  aproximately my looks are digging it and doing alright   And I don't understand at all     Whats going on   I'll die relatively soon   I'll live through first world problems   Could I hack it as a racoon    I suppose it would be similar enough    
Hard to say  There's no way that you  ought  to feel  if it's something that you've got past and can look on it as an unpleasant but time limited experience  that's a marvellous thing  Getting to that point does not  of course  diminish the seriousness of the crime itself   However  the society in which we live is so thoroughly vicious to men who have been raped that it's easy to imagine victims feeling that they have no option other than to be "all right" with this  Emotionlessness can be a coping strategy in such situations   May I ask what drew you to this subreddit  I might be wrong  but it seems to me that just finding out that this place exists took a bit of effort on your part  That would seem to indicate that it's still on your mind to some extent 
Hi  That's awesome that you're interested in support groups  If this is the first time you are trying group therapy and you have any questions  don't hesitate to ask me because I've had a trillion hours of it  I hope you can benefit from support groups like I  and many others I personally know  have benefited   OK   are you familiar with psychologytoday com's support groups finder  You can search by your zip code or city  or nearby ones   Then look on the left sidebar to narrow down your search by what you want the group to focus on  There should be contact information  so you know who to email or call

Check out DBT   I have similar thoughts worries and myths and this therapy method has helped me a lot  
You still have the certification from the course  Why cant you find another similar job  You are probably right to feel screwed over  but it wont do you any good to dwell on it 
   good then
Gotta at least give it a chance
She looks just like the dog I used to have   3 Happy New Year to you both  
So  because some people have it worse I can't be depressed  Because you're happy being single I can't be depressed  Being single isn't the only thing making me depressed  but it is one of the things  My chemical imbalance isn't subject to your discretion  Go fuck yourself 
That's not too far away  Can you hold on until then  Make sure you are honest with your therapist about how depressed you are so they can best help you 
Man  you definitely have a right to feel that way  Take it easy on yourself  I hope it'll all get better for you

It is nuts how people get angry   I've been in full on fights wear I was bored and without enthusiasm  but my bosses have lost it because I was listening to too liberal talk radio   
Thank you for the advice  I hadn't realized that temazepam could be making things worse      My psychiatrist actually started me on just lamotrigine  I had serious neurological side effects from lithium of all things  and was on zero medication for observation for a few months   I am not sure if lamotrigine does anything for me  except perhaps reduce mania frequency  it certainly didn't help with depression     After a year or 2 of misery I was "allowed" citalopram  which is wonderful  my depression and anxiety lifted rapidly  but without hypomania or anything  except during a crisis period 3 years later  It seems like it is just the withdrawal from seroquel that is destabilising things       
That's really shitty and inconsiderate of them to do  
There are so many people here who just wanna talk to someone and not feel lonely  I wish we could all just get together in a room and hang out for a bit

I'm 22  I found my first grey hair on my head this morning  Crazy  right    It's because I'm so stressed I'm p sure

Hi  My psychiatrists saved my life when they prescribed my medication  and that is not an exaggeration  Simply put  my mind and body do not function anywhere near 100  without my medicine    I'm on 225 mg of the generic version of the antidepressant of Effexor XR  and I'm on five milligrams of the generic version of the anti psychotic Abilify  I'm also on medication for hypothyroidism  but hypothyroidism developed waaaay after depression and anxiety  My results below are from my psychiatric medication  These are my experiences     I am no longer suicidal  I want to live  no more terrible headaches  much more energy  no more extreme fatigue  I sleep a regular amount instead of sleeping anywhere from fifteen to twenty hours a day  I don't want to self harm at all  no more brain fog  I can concentrate normally  my appetite has returned  I can actually leave my home  I am not stuck in bed  my hair has mostly grown back  being suicidal  depressed  and anxious put such a huge stress on my body that my most of my thinned and fell out   I can retain information that I read and hear  my memory is normal  I regained my appetite  my body doesn't feel like it weighs a million pounds anymore  no more body aches at all  I am no longer anywhere near being on the verge of having a panic attack  I am so much more calm  no more breakdowns  sex drive has returned to normal  no more crying spells  can tolerate a much higher level of stress without breaking down  I am not angry  I can feel all emotions again  I'm no longer numb  no more racing thoughts  no more constant feeling that the worst is going to happen     I haven't experienced a single side effect from my antidepressant at all  The only side effect I've experienced from the anti psychotic is increased hunger at higher doses  I'm on a lower dose now  so it's not an issue  I don't want to downplay the importance of my therapists though because they are also heroes   I mean this respectfully  but would it be possible to update your doctor on how you're doing when you get the chance  This doesn't necessarily mean that your medicine will be increased  but it's important to tell your doctor how you're doing  This is entirely your decision though  so no pressure from me  
Fuck yeah  Congratulations on trying your best man that's all that you can do  Cheers 
Oh yeah my cat died also  YEP GOOD YEAR FOR ME

I feel you  I've gotten to a point where I feel like I'm putting too much strain on a close friend  even if he tries to reassure me  There no way he can't hurt  you know  I'm starting to feel like I need to vent to him less  and have more fun with him instead  It's hard   I've gotten used to going to him for help  But I think   I need to try to find something else before I loose something that means everything to me  I hope that you don't loose your friends  I'm sure they care for you  Be sure to still have fun somehow  We have to find a way to thank the people who are willing to hear us out  help us in our darkest moments  I just can't think of anything better we could do except do our best to be happy 
Doesn't mean they should hell at me  
It's not like we can help it

Yeah I've never had the best experiences with trying to form relationships  I always assume I'm annoying or not important good enough to the person  I don't want to be in a relationship and force that person to be with me  I also don't want to show my aggressive jealous side

That's really sad  It seems to me he cares  but sometimes people get so wrapped up in their SOs that they forget that their friends need and care for them too   Does he know how you feel  I think just ending things like that would cause a lot of pain and confusion for both of you  He might have no idea why you no longer wish to be freinds with him  It's really really hard to have the "I think I love you" conversation with someone when you're fairly certain the answer from them will be no  And I'm not going to lie  when you hear the "no" it hurts like hell because it shatters the last bit of hope you held on to    But at the same time  hopefully this person can handle this confession with tact and respect and you two can work through it  Some friendships can weather that storm  and become stronger for it  And if it does get to the point where you decide it's too painful to carry on with the friendship  at least you have no "what ifs" and you both know where you stand

Same  and no one speaks to me  Vicious cycle 
Damn this is me to a T  I'm currently living with my parents and I'm am pretty anxious about moving out because they are my main source of comfort and help me to feel a lot less lonely  When I move out next year I don't even want to think about how I'll be coming home from a shitty day to an empty house 
I can totally relate 
Hello  fellow 17 year old here  I hope everything goes well once you get into college  I started school early  so I've already completed my first semester  My advice to you would be to try to not let your depression get the best of you during those first few months of college  I did  and I've basically destroyed all of the friendships I had built in both high school and the first weeks of college  Be strong  and happy new year 
It's disappointing because good days can happen  but somehow they don't last  Well  on the bright side not every day is bad lol 
If you listen to counting crows you're automatically a friend of mine    Definitely one of my favourites  and one of my favourites to show others  Stay awesome
Yes I think I can

Same  2016 just felt like the universe playing some cosmic joke on me  I know for a fact that 2017 will continue down the same path unless I actively make a change  If I don't I'll probably kill myself sometime next summer or fall  and I don't want that to happen  I want to live  I know I can feel happiness if I work for it  That's why I've decided I'm going to war with mySelf next year  I'm fucking done with this shit  so fucking tired of always feeling bad about who I am and my place in the world  It's time to finally take back control  Real control

Glad to hear it    feel free to message me if you ever need to talk  and don't be afraid to reach out to a hotline or your therapist if you ever feel suicidal again  
Please dont kill yourself  you even listed the reasons to live  Illnesses can be treated  people are here for you  you dont need to die  Even though i suffer from my own mountain of issues i still believe that if you fight hard enough things will work out in the end  Things will get better for you  youll find someone who cares about you  about your personality and not just your looks  There will always be treatments for illnesses  and death is such an extreme way out  At least try some of the treatments  What do you have to lose by trying if you want to die anyway  Best case you get better and you keep on living  You dont need to die 
It was terrifying for me is what I meant but you're absolutely right  It is what helped more than anything else 
I wish the best for you  Stay devoted and always keep the goal in mind  No matter how hard it is  that feeling of true happiness will always be worth it 
I literally stumbled onto it while digging through Reddit wasting time since my wife is at work  Realized my unanswered question and decided to ask 
Sweet  
It was my best and worst year all at the same time
I'm sorry  it wasn't intended at you  I'm just saying when someone makes a thread like this or talk about it in real life  people have a habit of using their experience as the truth to people who struggle to get a relationship  I'm with you  sorry if it came out wrong   Just adding some background to why I wrote it  There was a thread before saying how someone felt alone being without a SO and most people in the thread were replying how being in a relationship wont fix anything  I was kind of frustrated with their replies because they think their bad experiences of being in a relationship meant relationships are bad for everyone with depression in general 
This happened to me  but I have a good idea of why  I understand the behavior I did that caused it to happen  but it hurts so bad

I honestly know the feeling  same shit is happening to me right now  among other things  It might not be something you did  but something in their lives thats changed  Did you all just graduate or something  Maybe theyre moving on to jobs and college like my friends  It most likely has nothing to do with anything you did 
listen you can lose weight easily  you have to do it for you though  Don't start chucking the diet pills or hitting the gym because they told you negative things  You have to accept yourself no matter what  This doesn't have much value coming from me because I am literally having this problem now  Anyways your not alone  I know exactly how you feel 
First of all  have a wonderful birthday  No matter what lemons life gives you  you be strong  I can't imagine how to even feel the pain you've suffered but I hope for all the best in life ahead  Have a virtual hug from me and if you need to talk to a random person  whether to vent or just a casual chat hit me up with a PM  Happy New Year 
Im in the same situation  You arent alone 
I'm so sorry    You sound like a very beautiful person and I wish I could get to know you 
Some people are just awful  It's how this world is  I don't know why people choose to be so shitty  but they do  It's dumb but it's just how it is 
I wish we could hang out in real life   
Motherfucking horses

Same dude  Shit sucks  I really hate holidays because they always remember how alone I am 
Im trying to eat less  but its hard  due to all the other issues  i feel like eating might be part of how i soothe myself  like stress eating or whatever  I think that maybe alot of my problems are tied to each other  idk 
Thanks for the advice  Since I'm going to a college in another state  making and keeping new friends is going to be important  Im glad that I was able to finally let my feelings out and be taken seriously amd able to comverse with others like me  Thank you and happy new year to you too 
Maybe it's time to try something new  These are "dead mans goals" because you can never really achieve them  you never really know when you're there or how far you have to go   Why not start with stuff like   Not turn on phone for first half hour in the morning Meditate for 10 minutes every morning Work out three times a week Try going to a new place once a month Eat salad three times a week  Or anything else you can think of that will slowly turn your life healthier

The offered job was in the art domain but the course is rarely something used for art  So I have extremly low chances of using the course for an art job   It's been months trying to find a half decent job and nothing  I'm not even that picky for jobs  
Please don't give up
I am very sad as well   Beat wishes on your your twentieth

Same here man 
Thanks but it just doesnt get better  It's been months and my bank account is in the red  I just feel so out of solutions at this point 
They aren't shitty people is the thing  I know them  I have spent countless nights and days with them  I have literally been told by them that they are my best friends  I have been friends with them for my whole life that I remember  I just don't get it 
I love you too and thank you  May 2017 be easier to bear than 2016 for you  for all  
I want a drunk driver to hit me any night
I would argue with that cocksucking cashier so hard 
"Put yourself out there " Seriously  What's the point in putting yourself out there if you're practically invisible or just plain introverted like myself  
I've been drinking alone this New Year's Eve just like last year so I'm kinda sad and lonely and drunk rn but happy New Years to al of you guys  this is the only subreddit I always feel welcome in  I love you all  
I love all you internet strangers too  I'm glad we have this place to vent together  Stay strong and have a better new year   Edit  Am drunk too 
Yeah  I feel the same way so I don't know how to help you  I'm sorry you have to go through this shit man 
That's hard  Sometimes there are things about ourselves that feel our of our control    have you ever talked to a therapist    
Who are you   Who  
Drinking alone  thinking about texting my ex even though I know it's a bad idea

Remember a very important fact  The more open you can be the better  and faster  a therapist can help  I thought of main points  my history as I understand it  I wanted to get across on the first visit and maybe a little on the second and we went from there  He was a little surprised and said so  I replied why should I hold back  if I do you can't help me  I am brutally honest and open with him  Sadly thanks to insurance I had to switch and started the process all over  the second time was a little easier  As for the can of worms  It needs to be opened  you can not empty it out and hopefully heal if it stays closed 
Invisible  That's exactly how I feel and everybody I tell thinks it's bullshit  A woman's gaze can pass through me without the tiniest pause  I feel like a ghost 
Spent mine feeling wholly out of place in a club  It was the most alone I have ever felt in a  relatively  crowded room 
I too am spending new years alone  I will down my traditional can of coke a cola in your honour bro  Stay positive  and remember that you don't need to be out in groups to be happy and have a good time 
Your so right let me thank him now 
Please try to talk to your parents  man  I had my first suicidal ideations at 12  and I don't know what I'd have done without my folks  If they won't listen or help  talk to a school counselor  or any adult who will listen and get you the help you need  You have so much life ahead of you  Stay strong 
As a formerly depressed person  for me it was thinking those sorts of thoughts that led me to being depressed in the first place  It becomes self fulfilling  Meditation can help with this    Another question to ask yourself  Why does everyone despise you  I have a hard time believing this is true in the first place  but if you really think it is  try to analyze things from their perspective to see what it may be and what you can change  One tough thing about being depressed is that you don't feel like interacting with others or if you do  the interactions feel forced and unpleasant  People  being interested in only themselves  and you can't blame them  you are too   might take your bad mood the wrong way and like you less for it  Some people get tired of being your shoulder to cry on  I'm not saying this is good  this is just the way things are    A final thought for you    things probably won't change on their own  Stop focusing so much on how you bad you feel and start analyzing the situation objectively so you can fix it  Good luck

Tnx   And as always I had to fight with a gf  So I have decided to listen at your advice and it worked  Have enjoyed  it atleast a little bit till alcohol  Things work out quite good  Thank you    And how was your new year 
He knows  I've been fairly vocal with him about my feelings  He's my best friend so he's the first person I talk to when I don't feel good   I learned last year that I was never an option for him romantically  he doesn't see me that way  although he kept that foggy for the first year of our relationship  When I'd tell him how I felt about him  it was always a "I don't want to mess up the status quo"  but he kept saying I was the most important person to him    So that messed me up a lot haha   So I'm pretty set of the "what ifs"    there is no romantic hope  only friendship  but I don't know how I can handle him being back with his ex  there's a whole other story about that guy  but I don't want to get into details  cause it'll just make my whole story sound even more pathetic   I was handling it ok  but the Holidays  and knwing he's with him now  probably having fun and partying  while I'm all alone    it's hard

I've been sitting here for around an hour now  wondering how in the world I was going to start this comment  Thinking to myself  "No  that's a shit way to start " or "What if someone I know recognized my username and started mocking me about what I was saying " Even as I write this  I think to myself  "Why would anyone be interested in what you have to say " or the one time m dad told me   Once was all he needed  "Man up " And with that I think to myself "Guys shouldn't cry" or "Guys don't talk about feelings and get emotional "  I guess what I'm trying to say is that I understand the inferiority that you feel  The feeling of "I need to be the best at everything  or I am nothing " Now  I'm not going to say that I know exactly what you are going through because I don't  I also don't want to sound like I have it worse therefore you shouldn't have anything to complain about   I've had people say to me plenty of times that they understand what I'm going through and all that crap  but when I ask them to describe it they either can't or just repeat what I said to them  I've also had people try to "one up" my issues like a fucking game to see who's life is shittier and who should shut up because the other has it worse  Either that or they just straight up tell me  "There are others who have it worse than you " and I hate it more than anything so it's the last thing I would want to do to someone else    I recently graduated from high school and I am living at my parents house still  I constantly think to myself everyday  "Look at you  sitting here day after day  playing games watching movies and browsing the internet  Useless "  "You don't have a job  nor do you help around the house hardly ever  You just sit here wasting everyone's time and money "  My best friend from when I stared school up to when I got to high school was great  We did everything together whenever we could  It was great  When we got to high school however  I started to talk to him about certain things that bothered me or that I was struggling with  He started to "one up" me one shitty things that happened to him and didn't care about my problems at all  Once he got a group of friends who liked to smoke  drink  skate  steal etc  He only ever called me if all of his other friends were busy  And stupid me  I would always oblige thinking that maybe one day he would actually enjoy my company again  I started to think that he never actually wanted me around even when we were younger  Just the thought that someone could just dump a friend off like that after 6 7 years like nothing infuriated me  and killed me  The possibility that I was just "filler" that whole time was absolutely heartbreaking to me  From then on  I tried to fit in the best I could with whoever I could  Even if we had nothing in common I  just wanted people to appreciate me  for real this time  So I started to try to be the best at everything  If someone liked sports  I had to be the best at that so they might accept me  did they appreciate someone with good grades  Had to be the best at that too  I started to hang around with people I didn't even like just to be accepted  constantly worrying that they would just leave me in the blink of an eye  Through the years I found some friends that I actually liked to be around and felt  reasonably  comfortable with  But they always moved away   It had started my obsession with being someone I wasn't  It was who I was now  I can't even remember how it felt to be me  My thoughts are always scattered and fragmented and there are times when I literally can't form thoughts that even make sense to me  Trying to speak to people is difficult because I have no idea what to say or even how to say it because I'm trying to think of what they want to hear rather than what I would say  I am so distracted with trying to fit in  I literally don't know what kind of person I am  Am I nice  Am I loud  Am I annoying  Am I thoughtful   All of the shit I've had thrown at me used to make me sad and lonely and that became a normal feeling  Recently  it's been either I feel nothing or I feel hatred towards anything  everything  Hatred  thinking that I deserve all of this  but why  What the actual fuck did I do to feel like this   Most of my hatred however is directed at god  if there is one   My mom is religious and so took me to church when I was younger  Didn't think to much on the concept of god mostly because the people attending that church were all cunts so I just assumed that all Christians were that way  Later though about half way through high school  I thought I found my "salvation" so to speak  I had found people that I really enjoyed being around  still nervous around though   It was a youth group organized through two churches  one nearby and one out of town  It was a small group of people who I could have thoughtful conversations with  It was the only thing really worth living for  I thought to myself  "If this is what being a christian is all about  count me in " I would pray to god go to church  the works  After a few months  however  most of the people there had graduated and moved off to University or College and the majority of the group was replaced with a bunch of loud  annoying 10 14 year olds  I was utterly destroyed yet again  It was all back to normal now  I started to blame god for everything  started to build up all of my hatred towards everything  I've built up so much hatred for god and life that I get so unbelievably angry at everything that annoys me  Now the only thing that makes me even remotely happy is the escape that games provide  It's not enough but it's something   Every time something goes wrong in game  aside from if an enemy kills me or something  I get infuriated  For example if my internet is suddenly slow and I can't play a game that requires internet connection or if my game crashes I get so angry it's ridiculous sometimes leading to fits of rage telling god to die  I think the reason is that  I feel as though god has taken so much from me including my entire personality that I have to feel protective of what Good thing I have left  That being games   I'm sorry this got a little off track from my original statement about relating to your sense of inferiority compared to others  Sorry if this seems like more of a rant than anything  I hope you could follow all of it without much difficulty  Like I said  it's been difficult for me to even form sensible thoughts never mind explaining something to someone else   I'm also not sure how this would help in anyway  but I felt the need to post here   Edit  Sorry for the wall of text too 
I'm sorry  I just want you to know I read your post  I hope you don't go through with it  and that I hope something happens that brightens your day for a change  But if you do go through with it  I hope you'll find yourself at peace

Same  Happy New Year to you as well
Hi  So first off don't worry about sounding unreasonable  I highly doubt anyone here will put you down or judge you    You're seeing a therapist  that's great  First piece of advice I tell anyone is to see a therapist and you're already on it  When it comes to medication you'll get a lot of different opinions but honestly for me it was always a temporary fix  new medication every year for 3 4 years  as they would just stop working  I actually was off medication when I started feeling better but that's just my personal experience    I also had OCD related to food  I couldn't eat the first part of whatever I looked at unless it was the left side of it  OCD is weird ay   and I would constantly throw stuff out but ya gotta eat  Try to find something if you can  easier said than done I know    With your parents I'm hesitant to comment on it because it's such a personal thing  I guess the best thing to say is help and support them if they deserve it but don't sacrifice your own health happiness    I really hope this helps and please feel free to PM me if you want to get into more details or if you have any questions   
I am here if you need to talk  just send me a PM 
Same situation here  Sucks  doesn't it    
Me too  friend 
There is always help   Please PM me  and we can talk 
There is no need to end your life  I promise   PM me  and I will talk about anything you want 
Well then ask them why they don't invite you  They may just think you're not interested 
Same   
God dammit I wish I could stop giving a fuck  I try so hard but it every now and then it hurts to be so lonely 
Way to take that rejection and keep going  Congrats

Happy New Year  I'm drunk and on Reddit  Wishing all of  r depression the best for 2017 
Wow it's been 5 years of depression  Can't wait for another year of dying inside 
People on the internet are much different of how they are in real life  
What if you don't know what you want 
I've been trying to get that fresh start  For years  It never came 
I get exactly how you feel  I'm glad I'm at my house with my family for NYE for the moments I need to retreat back to my room  2016 has been the worst year for me mentally and I don't have much hope for this year    I also spent a lot of my time sleeping  for me it's a sweet escape from reality  I do have a couple friends but that's it  My bff is going to school out of state and my other friend  while I do care for her  just don't have much in common and she doesn't know how depressed I am  I can't tell her or my family  I feel too ashamed    I'm in college but the thing is is that I was supposed to sign up for my classes for my next semester starting in a few weeks and I didn't  I have 4 days left to sign up and even if I did  I'm not sure I'd get the money in time  So I guess it's too late  I also just have no motivation  I just need a break from school even though I can't afford to take one    I also felt completely out of place  Everyone was laughing and joking around and happily shouting Happy New Year and I felt no joy or excitement  Yes  it's a new year  but a happy one  Hmm I don't know about that  More like a year full of anger  depression  misery  apathy  failure and virtually no personal growth whatsoever  Happy New Year    NOT    Just to let you know  I care and just try your best to hang in there  I know it's tough but if it brings you any comfort at all  know you're not alone  Sorry for just rambling on and on about my life  
Last week I cleaned all my computer's and deleted accounts like this one  I don't have much money but I pulled it all out and put it in a box for my brother  I'm looking for a reason to just keep going but I feel like a hamster just doing the same thing over and over  I know I will never find anyone with my current personality but I'm so fucking broken inside I don't know how to be happy to attract someone  And I'm not happy because I'm so damn lonely and the thought of growing old and being alone my entire life makes me want to just give up
Just know that there is no such thing as 'being normal'  I encourage you to spend some time with family  Being with anyone is better than being alone  
So cute     Dogs really are so special and can soothe us in so many ways  Please tell your pup that I think he is very handsome     
I started talking to a counselor first  It was hard to open up  and it was also hard for me to figure out why and what I was feeling  and after around 4 or 5 months of counseling I started seeing a psychiatrist  By that point it was easier for me to talk to the psychiatrist because I learned to open up with the counselor more  I got meds and I'm feeling better now  but a little different  I don't feel much emotions anymore and it's really hard for me to trust people now  But I think being able to open up is an important thing  They might be able to help you learn how to deal and handle your feelings  and I think once I was able to open up I felt a bit better since I didn't feel as if I had to hold everything in 
110  worth it 
Mac's whole evolution argument science is a liar sometimes was brilliant  the whole episode really    "He created a reasonable doubt  he makes you sound like a stupid science bitch "

Thank you for your support  I really appreciate it  Unfortunately I don't have the messages as they took place via snapchat   
The thought makes me ill 
Currently on vilazodone 40 mg d plus gabapentin 3600 mg d plus clonazepam 1 mg about 1 2 times per week   This is the best I've been in a long time  Previously on citalopram  venlafaxine  and duloxetine and they all dulled my sexual appetites way too much  Vilazodone plus gabapentin is a reasonable compromise   Many people are going to need higher doses of paroxetine  Paxil  than you're on   Ideally  meds should decrease your anxiety like 80 90  
I've learned some people are just not made for interaction  It's sucks buts true
There is a story I'd like to tell you  please feel free to shoot me a PM if you're interested 
  I encourage you to spend some time with family   I'd attempt that if they weren't so drunk and rowdy already  All they are doing is annoying me  At least they're having fun with themselves  i guess
Anything can happen in 2017  Happy new year to you and I hope this one won't be a waste
   it doesn't have to stay that way  time as humans describe it is arbitrary    for example  it's still 2016 where I am so to me it's your 2016 that ended terribly  not your 2017 that started terribly  I hope it gets better  3 
I know it's hard as things change   Please feel free to shoot me a PM if you need someone to talk to tonight 
Sitting by myself while my roommates have a great time with their plethora of friends and boyfriend  Cried a little and I don't feel like intruding on any of their fun  Who am I to butt in  This time last year I was making an awful choice to betray someone and karma got me as I sit here all alone thinking about how I've treated people and put myself in this lonely situation  Too anxious and awkward to go out    so sitting and watching Netflix with beer   thinking about whether or not I'll always be alone like this  God I hate the holidays and I can't wait for this to be over  
Interesting year for sure
God this is me  I need to stop being a pathetic sack of shit too  I don't think it's very realistic for me though  
I'm sorry your night didn't turn out like you hoped  I'm alone here as well  unless you count my dog and two asshole cats  My only real friend is 1500 miles away  so I'm enjoying a nice beer and perusing reddit 
A Long December is my current favourite  But Another Horse Dreamers Blues is awesome  Mr Jones was the song that got me started  because my local pop radio actually played it  and I fell in love 
There's always an answer to escape suicide  You may not know it  but why not live and find out 
I'm glad you made it   It's not an easy road to change  and your mind will fight you the entire time you're trying  but just take it one step at a time   You'll get there if you believe in yourself 
I want to say it "helps" that I don't get my hopes up anymore  but these years of not looking forward to anything have just made me more dead inside

Thank you for responding and not being an ass like the other guy that commented in

I was guessing based on the two symptoms I mentioned but you'd need to speak with the doctor

Can't upvote this hard enough  I quit Facebook a couple years a go and am so glad I did  It's just a filter for showing all the amazing shit in people's lives and making you feel like a loser 
Fucking salad cured my depression    Thanks for the laugh 
Happy new years   What a shitty year  hope you all are doing alright  Don't got high hopes for 2017  waiting for 2018 to come by already 
Sex is a complicated subject  and isn't the exact same for every single person on this earth   Some us enjoy the idea of just being with someone for the sake of being  but others need a real connection with someone   Focus less on the sex  and more on getting to know someone with meaning to you  it might be closer to what you're looking for

That's the sad part  The BS isnt over  Its 100  going to spill in 2017 
Awww you've been doing great lately  don't let tonight get ya down  I think New Year's Eve is an easy trigger for us  you know  I stayed in and turned down invites because the thought of being in loud  huge crowds and driving on the roads when alcohol is popular tonight just   no  Not even if my wife was with me  she's my safe person  or if it was close to home  Sigh  Anyhow  this tends to be a wild night so  I think we can be gentle with ourselves   hugs   PS   I feel like all the celebrity losses in the last week or so has made my anxiety ramp up  Totally irrational  I know  Hopefully when the clock strikes midnight here  15 more minutes  I'll start to calm down a bit  
Desire just took over and I cut myself again on my arm  I hope this isn't indicative of what's to come this next year  I'm planning on talking to a pysch soon so hopefully that'll help  I just feel so alone in how I feel  like I have no one to relate to  
It's very common for someone to want to want to die  and want to live  at the same time   When we're sitting in that dark room  pain in our eyes  as we feel a minute  cold  metal  against our temples  and our finger muscle just       Can't       Take that last step       And we struggle  and shake  and stare into the mirror  and curse ourselves for being weak  for not being strong  for not having constitution  we need to consider the view most ignored   Sometimes  we don't really want to die   We just don't want to hurt anymore 
Happy New Year 
i dunno what to feel about this but  okay  stay strong buddy
Im very sorry to hear that but death is not the answer  Have you tried getting professional help for your depression

Hi there  For me the road to recovery started with ERP and once I was able to limit or eliminate many of my compulsions  which took a while  I then focused on the anxious thoughts and obsessions  It's still something I struggle with on a daily  probably hourly  basis but I've gotten pretty good at letting the anxious thoughts just naturally pass through my mind  I first try to realize what I am thinking is irrational  I always always make a point of actually saying to myself "this thought is irrational"  and then I let the thought play it's course in my mind  rather than working myself up by trying to eliminate it  and it's usually gone pretty quickly  If the thought persists I do some deep breathing or go to find a distraction  exercise and movies being my go to distractions when I'm not at work   I don't mean to put these strategies in a way to make them sound simple or easy because they are not and a good therapist could probably describe them much better than I can   Don't undermine the work you've done  OCD and anxiety changes so coping mechanics need to change too sometimes  Keep your head up  I think all of us who have suffered from OCD and anxiety are mentally tough people even though sometimes it can feel like the opposite    I hope I didn't ramble too much and you can PM me whenever  Happy New Year   
I get psychotic reactions if I'm not tired enough to sleep  and regardless I end up exhausted and depressed the next 2 days

Anything you like to do  Or distracts you for a bit  Could always just sleep too  
     Feel bad   Never sleep near people

Volunteered to work 4 hrs early  My coworkers all were surprised that I came in early  Now I feel like a loser because they know nothing is at home for me 
First  you need to find a psychiatrist who specializes in OCD    Second  you can find books and websites about ERP  It's a step by step process  Touch something dirty  Wait a bit longer than you normally would without washing  Increase the time that you wait each time  You're retraining your brain to be okay with being dirty and that nothing bad will happen    Finally  you also have to protect your skin to avoid infection  Maybe wear gloves  Even if you put on lotion and cotton gloves while you sleep  that would help  Look for hand creams that work even after hand washing  Use gentle soap  Don't use super hot water  
Its just a number  life will keep its same course  the number has no signifcancy i fear
Medication helps too I guess   
Spot on  I just don't want to hurt anymore 
why 
You are most certainly entitled and deserving of help and support regarding these flashbacks regarding your ex  You are suffering secondary trauma which is not uncommon   I strongly suggest that you reconnect with your therapist or find a new trauma therapist that you are comfortable working with  Until you are able to cope with what you are struggling with  you really can't be much support to your ex  I also suggest that you consult with your therapist about how you might support your ex and take care of yourself at the same time    You can't be at your best supporting someone else while your own well being is suffering    Take good care of yourself 
Hey  I'm sorry you been depressed lately  Sorry about the family problems and rejection  It's cool that you got a job though  And started your own fucking podcast   What is it called  Ha  it is a bitch  The human brain can be a bitch sometimes  or a lot of times   You dont have to get your hopes up if you don't want you but I'LL definitely be hoping you'll have a better year man 
I would love that

Why must life be so hard   Why must I fail af every attempt at masonry 
have no friends due to social anxiety and moving to a new state and parents would rather hang out with their high school friends than stay with me

Thanks for the reply   I agree  I need to focus less on the actual act of sex   Unfortunately I let my sexual anxiety problem fester into a massive inferiority complex to the point where I don't even feel worthy talking to girls  and as soon as they give any indication they are sexually interested I don't know what to do   It doesn't help that I go to FSU and was involved in the greek system  a culture where every young man's self worth is determined by the sexual access he has

Real life just hit me all at once  I've been relatively fortunate in that I didn't experience much death and loss in general before this year    My best friend moved around the world and joined a dangerous cult while in the middle of a manic episode  Another friend killed himself  Two months later another friend killed himself  I got laid off a month or two later  My great grandfather died  although that was a timely and comfortable death  which I'm grateful for   In July my step mom died young  I was very close with her  By this point my already existing alcoholism became completely out of control  My family and long time girlfriend did an intervention  I agreed to go to treatment  At that point things were supposed to look up but while I was in treatment my girlfriend moved a guy in and they were sleeping together in our bed and all that shit  She started acting like a completely different person  I didn't bother fighting her on the apartment and bed because it felt gross even though we rented together  Still trying to get my things but she's dodging me and the new boyfriend is harrassing me    Aside from how I've felt I've watched a lot of these things really hurt people I love  It's been dark    There are positives though  I completed a 10 week treatment program  I'm 3 5 months clean and sober  Its new years and I'm not drunk  I still have my family and a lot of people that love me  I'm sheltered and fed  I havent tried to kill myself

I hear ya  Would listening to more upbeat music help  Even cheesy silly shit
I love that feeling  I know the isolation is bad for me but sitting unnoticed in a bar or club is somehow more isolating than being alone in the wilderness  
I meant Another Horsedreamer's Blues  I got it combined with a story lol   The two you listed are awesome as well  I love Possibility Days  as said  and God Of Ocean Tides
And there is absolutely nothing selfish about that   People like to twist that with us  because they can't understand   The simple idea of being suicidal  I believe  opens a door in our minds   A heavy door  that's very difficult to shut   Even as we become happier  and get a better control on our lives  that door could still be open     There are people who don't understand how difficult that open door is to ignore  and bastardize it   They bastardize us   An important thing to note is that this is not done maliciously  people can care about you  and be angry with your choices   The thing that's helped me recently  is to view myself as a resource   Seems a waste to get rid of this physically healthy human being  when I can do things like stay up late on NYE and talk to people feeling the same pain I've felt for most of my life 
Hey  me too

No offence taken understand you I feel the same

Another year expecting things to change and feeling isolated and alone as usual  someone just please make this stop

First things first  cut the sad music  no need to make yourself feel sad  It's 2017 and there's hope for new opportunities that can present itself to you  hopefully ones that can make you happy 
I know my thought was always "if they wanted to talk to me  they'd initiate a conversation " Got very lonely and loss a lot of friends in one year     Good luck in the new year  I think we all need it  
Life is like a cult
Good luck  I hope you can find something you can relate to soon

Yes  those are great songs  I mainly listen to Counting Crows and Eric Clapton actually  Especially Eric's songs about the passing of his son  they are so deep and meaningful to me   And his guitar playing doesn't hurt   
I wonder how many of these you guys ticked off the list  I have atleast 5 of those 
Eating healthy didn't 'cure' my depression but it made my mood swings a hell of a lot more stable  It's one thing I've changed that helped my depression  No one thing is going to cure you  It's a mix of getting good social interaction  not believing your distorted thoughts and changing perspective  living a healthy life  which includes fruits and veggies  cutting out processed food  exercise  getting enough sleep  cutting back on screen use      For me personally  it's worked a hell of a lot better than antidepressants  and I've tried numerous types over 15 years   Or you can just hope to magically become happy without doing anything to try and move towards that  too  
I knew I'd be spending this one alone  as I do every year   so I decided to spoil myself a little  Got some nice cheese  cured meats  and a good beer  and am enjoying them by myself  well  with the dog and cats   Yeah  it hurts being along again on NYE  but I did a little something for myself so it hurts a little less

I'm glad that you are    
The importance of the systems around us are often out of control  but this is one of few instances where the importance can be defined by you   What works for the crowd doesn't necessarily work for everyone  just as sex is different for everyone   There are better outlets for you to obtain self worth     Keep in mind  part of your performance issue could be directly related to your anxieties related to it 
This was year was also the worst year of my life  I've had depression for a long time but this entire was just terrible suffering  I hope to god it's better in 2017  but I doubt it 
Hey  you don't  know  next year will be worse  Sometimes things have to get worse before they can get better  Like addicts say "hitting rock bottom" makes them realize they need to change their life   And there's nothing wrong with wanting attention  Humans are social animals and we all want to feel safe and loved  
  hugs back  
i dunno where you're coming from with that post  help me understand 
Wow  that was tough to read  Please don't do it  You sound like you have so much going for you  I know it feels like you don't  but sometimes an outside perspective can see things more clearly than you  No  I don't have a clue about your illnesses  but like others have said  there are other resources and it can get better  Just give it some more time and talk to someone about how you feel    You said it yourself  you don't want to die  Don't give up 
Youll get used to it eventually  At first you might be bitter from loneliness but maybe you wont mind it    in a few years 
Shit  I just started watching Sunny for the first tome and saw that one last night  Love it 
Good luck  It's good you're staying positive  Hope you find a good therapist and you can get something out of it

First  let me say my heart goes out to you  Mental illness is no joke and can be very hard to deal with    Secondly if you have any thoughts at all about doing something reckless or hurting yourself please call a crisis hotline  You can google 211 in your area or just call 1 800 273 8255 if you're in the USA    I really hope you find a way to cushion the impact of this breakdown  Maybe call your therapist if you have one  
That sounds good  the turnaround   I wasn't into going to a NYE party  Good conversations like that can't be beat 
Same deal here man  I gave up on my old friends and just started going out alone and meeting other lonely people at bars  My newer aquaintances don't respond all the time  but it helps knowing I can go find someone random to talk to if they don't  
They are projecting their frustration on you  because that is easier than confronting their own feelings  
Nihilism will help  I turned to it as an excuse for my depression but it's just led me to try and improve my life  
most people that give those tips are people that have likely been sociable for quite some time and don't really see the other side of the story  or they haven't been depressed in so long they don't realize what it feels like anymore 
What's your favorite CC song 
There's only fire  
You said that so many times you find yourself wanting to see a specialist  Then  yes  you should  People don't deserve to be feeling terrible and asking themselves why they are living    If there are counselors or psychiatrists in your area then I would contact them if possible  I know it doesn't work for everyone  but it's worth a shot   It helped with me   I hope things get better  PM me if you have questions or just want to talk
 Somehow newyears is rhe worst
I'm so sorry  I don't know what I'd do without my dog  I know they can't be replaced  but can you get another one 
Kicked off the new year with another social rejection and feeling ignored as usual  Yay  
Me too  I used to be paralyzed with it  My friends are off getting their Master's  getting married and so on  I'm just trying to figure it out  A lot of people are in the same boat  if it helps  
Ha  yep  Got "invited" to a little shindig by two different people attending  but not by the hosts  Wouldn't go because they know me and I was like if they wanted me they would've invited me  Binge watched black mirror and cried a little instead  Fuck 
 removed 
I suggest you go anyways  Especially because you're feeling particularly alone  If you have the money  please go and don't let it get worse  A lot of us are beyond that point and it is so SO hard to turn back  Your mental health is worth a professional's time even if it's short term  Please don't wait until you are "bad enough " 
RIP 2015  2014  and 2013  You guys will always be missed 
It's hard  I'm trying my damnedest  One step at a time  I guess  
what happened 
I used to smoke 24 7 then it started giving me panic attacks so I quit for over three months  It didn't help very much  If I lived in a legal state I would try different types to see if it helped  I will say vaping wasn't as bad for me  
yo
Crying at the start of the New Year  Oh how fucking auspicious 
There is no "supposed to"
sometimes I can't help but think "hit me hit me hit me hit me" when I'm walking in front of a car that eventually stops  maybe one day it won't stop  
I dont know  I eat healthy  I do meditation  I try to see people  I dont take antidepressants and I just feel like there's no end  It's just the purgatory constantly no matter what 
I feel the exact same way as you do right now  I've been in this mood since Wednesday night  I saw my therapist on Wednesday afternoon and I'm too scared to even call her this soon  I want to tell her how I feel  but again I'm scared  If I tell her I want to put a bullet in my brain but I'm too scared to will I be hospitalized  I have all these thoughts running in my head constantly now  My mind is just constantly racing  I feel sad as fuck and then I'm angry because I feel like I have no reason to be so sad  I know if it gets to a point where I can't personally deal with it I have a few options and those are calling her  calling 911  or going to the hospital  I'm scared as hell at those options  I know these feelings will pass until next time  There is lots of us fighting this fight  Every day is a struggle  There's no right answer of what to do nothing makes it any better  You just have to ride it out and if it gets too bad to where you can't handle it you call for help or go to a hospital  It's scary as hell to think about but that's the best advice 
Did you read my diary  I wish you all the luck in this new year  
I was trying to disconnect my dead water softener and almost flooded the garage  Took a nice hot shower  started the fire and had a good beer  Trying not to think about all the fun the rest of the world is having 
Man  fuck social media 
I feel like I'm in the exact same situation and I want to change that in 2017  I have no idea how though  Fml  
I was like that for a while a few months ago but it's really starting to pile on and I can't ignore it anymore  
I guess its on me to wait until I find something that interests me  Thanks  means a lot    
Hang in there  I hope you find the strength to make the changes you need 
I'm so sorry you lost your friend  I hope you can find someone to talk to about it  I really think it could help

please don't  Things an change  Things  will  change  
Happy New Year  From one lurker to another 
Absolutely brilliant show  Watch it from the beginning since they frequently refer to past episodes actor characteristics  First season is good  but probably the least interesting  Then season two  Danny Devito joins and every episode from then on is hilarious 
Thank you
Eh  people suck anyways  Just pick a few you like and hang on tight     Happy new year  
Hope 2017 is a great one for you as well 
Hey what's up 
You should seek out counselling or a therapist  
It's nothing  just another weekly depressive episode   Thanks for asking though
Good job for doing all that  Seriously  A lot of people don't make the effort to live a healthy life  Give yourself props for everything you've been doing  for trying to improve your life  Have compassion towards yourself   Have to tried Metta LovingKindness mediation  I can't say I'm all in love with myself now but I did feel a bit of a shift  I did it every day for two weeks  
Hi
I'm into S3 now  Loving it 
I was thinking this just now   
The first time I used it I felt calm and sleepy then pretty much nothing after that  I only tried two brands though and supposedly it takes two weeks of use to get the full effect  I found a small supplier I'm gonna order a different type and some skullcap tincture    I would say try it  I don't think it would make things worse for you  Definitely research it though  
Happy new year 
There are support groups in many places  I've been going to Refuge Recovery groups despite not having addiction issues  There might be ones even more geared towards depression 
Sadly I don't think he knows the difference  He's just a spiteful little shit who gets off on the pain of others  I mean he's enjoying the feelings of depression that urgeless is feeling right now  
we are here for you man
Ill post the math theorem here once the whole issue is resolved  It will make me feel better  
That's a shitty deal  My not very good advice would be to go get lots of alcohol your drug of choice  a decent hooker  then drink and fuck until you forget the whole thing  But you probably shouldn't listen to that  Work on your confidence bud  things'll get better 
Hope it gets better 
That is sound advice  but I feel the reason why it felt especially bad this time was it was from someone I felt should know me better  Now I worry that all I've been the entire time I've known said person is this "mansplanner " It's not someone I'm close with anymore  so was able to calm myself after a while  but it still bothered me 
So I've spent a lot of time reading and thinking about this subject and over the last year or two my mood has improved significantly  I'd consider myself happy maybe 70 80  of the time   First you need to understand what makes you unhappy and generally  unhappiness comes from three sources    The first way is that your brain just isn't producing or maintaining enough of the chemicals that make you happy  This is persistent unhappiness and is due to a systematic problem that needs to be fixed  We usually just label it depression  but there are a myriad of things that can cause this  Drug and alcohol abuse are common ways to screw up your brain  When you exercise or have sex  your body endogenously produces some feel good chemicals  The system that regulates this has evolved for thousands and thousands of years and will not overdose your brain on these feel good chemicals  When you're pouring in chemicals from an external source  there is basically no way to regulate the dosage so it is very easy to go above whatever limit would be considered safe  Having persistent sleep issues that have no apparent source or feeling anxious or sad ALL the time  then you should visit a doctor as that may be the only way to fix this type of problem    The second source of unhappiness can be equally persistent but is due to a problem with perception  A common example is being unhappy with your appearance  To be unhappy about how you look  you have to first put a high value on physical appearance  have some pre existing ideal of beauty and be rating yourself as uglier than your ideal  It is a good thing to care about how we look since we use looks to quickly judge people we don't know  But how much do YOU actually value looks when it comes to the people you spend your time with and care about  It is probably not at the top of your list  There is no reason to think it would be at the top of everyone else's  so perhaps you are overvaluing the importance of how you look  Additionally  your ideal version of beauty is completely subjective  You may look fine to others and this is the goal of putting time in to your appearance  so there is no problem here   The last thing that can lead to unhappiness is inaction  If you're in a bad relationship and it is causing you misery  the problem isn't going to fix itself  You gotta get out of there  Similarly  if you're single and in a rut  sittting around at home isn't going to fix your problem  Go out and meet some people  If you're upset with yourself for not eating healthy  change up your habits    In general when trying to diagnose some source of unhappiness  always analyze your situation objectively and ask yourself why you feel a certain way  Don't stop at "I feel ugly" or "I feel lonely"  Ask yourself why you feel ugly or lonely and keep going until you have a plan in place to fix your problems  If there is nothing you can do  you need to adjust your expectations to meet reality  this usually happens naturally over time  but actively accepting your situation can help speed up the process   Therapy helps here  If there is something you can do  make a plan and do it  Don't think about it 
Everyone has different personalities when they're with friends than when they're alone or at home  so try not to overthink or worry too much until your appointment  Explain to your doctor and I'm sure they can help you more     Good luck 
I practice mostly Vipassana but I try to do some Metta  I have a hard time forgiving myself so doing Metta is a challenge for me 
Thank you for the response  I am sorry you have this reaction  
If this was a job  I would blackmail the boss 
Your feelings of being betrayed and taken advantage of are valid  Many survivors feel this   Have you considered talking with a trauma therapist about all that you are feeling  A properly trained professional would understand your feelings and be able to help you process what you are dealing with 
 removed 
it's painful when you can't rely on emotional support from your parents  i try not to bring any emotional matters to my folks because they're clueless  and i end up feeling worse when i tell them about something that's tearing me apart and they respond with the  weather report   i'm fortunate to have a few friends i can talk to when i'm in pain   
You don't need to know what is wrong with you to seek help  Depression isn't necessarily every single day being awful  It can be being fine some days and then awful other days  If you're at the point where you're tired of feeling terrible and you've been feeling like a burden then yes  there are definitely professionals that help with that kind of thing  Mental problems are an enormous spectrum and incredibly common in the mild forms  There is no need to be a certain level of bad before you seek help 
You feel SA when you change profile pics also   
Happy New Year to you too 
I just wanted to write this somewhere and I'm not sure where to write it  2016 has been one of the hardest years of my life  I got kicked out of ROTC for a medical reason  I failed an entire semester of classes and dropped out of college  I feel like I am a complete failure  I had surgery for my legs in march and nothing has really changed since then  My recovery is taking so long that I feel like I wont ever run any kind of distance ever again    It has gotten to the point where I cant stop and think about what has happened  because if I stop and dwell on school  or my career that has been flushed down the toilet I just shut down    I don't know what I hope to accomplish by getting all this out here  
Hey can you link any of the podcasts  It's definitely something I'd want to atleast try someday  
Thank you for the response     Things are hard though  '   I'm very sure I'm not gonna get through January sadly   
I was so low before  Then I saw a great post on reddit depression where the OP said " I will make 2017 my bitch"  I nodded to this  I'm sick of feeling low  shit  unhappy  anxious  Screw it all  I will own you 2017
Hey there  20 year old girl here  I remember the anxiety of being 18 and needing to fix everything right away and freaking out about relationships  But  two years later  I've learned a valuable lesson  No other human being is going to make you happier than you can make yourself  And besides  What's wrong with being alone  I hope you think about it a little  Maybe learn to love your own company because for now  it's what you have  Not always going to be the case of course  I promise  But for now  breathe  Life is one big process  The process is happening as you read this  I promise that too     Happy new years  
Hit the gym  save some money  move out  Even if you have to move out with a friend or an acquaintance you still learn something and you gain your freedom  Don't be afraid that if you live with someone you hate it will suck  I'm not saying that there isn't a possibility that it won't suck  I'm just saying it's worth the experience and freedom right  You'll meet some people  get your endorphins flowing from working out  and learn some real world skills  like how to find a place in society that may help you feel apart of something   If you wanna move out you have to make some changes to whatever lifestyle you're living that prohibits it  It's not gonna be easy either  You have to work for it  Maybe go out to an event  bar  show  social gathering of any sort  every couple weeks or so and work up from there  Meet some people  pick up some more hours at your job  and get in shape  There's a lot of simple improvements that if you make them habits can benefit you so much  The best thing for me when I'm dealing with my depression and anxiety is to realize that there is nothing to be afraid of and that the world isn't going to crash around me into a million tiny pieces if I make a mistake  If you wanna vent you can pm me  I stayed at grandmas for awhile too
I actually feel like I've ended 2016 on a good note  Ok I didn't make it out to any huge parties but I forced myself to meet the friend group for a couple drinks  and even played a round of charades  before returning to my room while they went out  
Decided last minute to skip planned festivities  Instead I made a pizza  watched Netflix    smooched my puppies at midnight  Much better than standing in a crowded club while all my friends kiss their SOs at 12   going home alone   depressed  Happy 2017 
Not true  Just because you came to work early does not in any way shape or form make you a loser  
Fuck I was just gonna say this

Alone in the dark  trying to sleep but my husband is in the other room yelling into his mic while playing Xbox  He didn't even bother to give me a midnight kiss  Felt really neglected but then my 6 year old came in and gave me a New Years "kiss" a few minutes after midnight  She should be asleep but I'm glad that she somehow knew I needed someone 
I'm so proud of you 
Hey  can you come back to this post  OP accidentally replied to themselves not you 
I really hope things get better  If no one is there for you  then we are  damn it  Please don't 
Well he came back  Pretty sure he's fucking wasted though  Awesome    
Have you taken anything  darling 
Holidays suck  I can't help but get a little jealous when I see people on social media doing things  Going out and socializing  partying etc  While I'm stuck at home doing pretty much nothing except browsing the Internet  gaming  and using reddit  Heh  guess that ties into Internet usage  They'll be over soon though  Don't worry 
It sounds like you didn't have someone who suited your needs  There isn't any point on affecting someone else's recovery from depression by being so negative  If one doctor doesn't work you don't just stop going to the doctor  you find a new doctor  If you need someone you need to vent to feel free to pm me  
2015 was awful for me  2016 was awful for me  and now I'm terrified for this year
  
Sadly a clock change does not change the mind 
Honestly you can't worry about what your doctor thinks  If something concerns you  go  I can attest to the power of a medical professional setting my mind at ease  You should also be up front that you suspect anxiety so they can treat that as well  if they aren't already 
Every year it gets worse for me  2016  my 13 y o dog  who's my best friend  only true friend  who I spent 24 7 of the past year with died  I feel more alone and hopeless than ever  and its growing  so 2017 is already feeling pretty bad   
That's awesome 
Ok is good  Have a happy new year   
Any death grips fan's in this sub  man I swear sometime's i just feel like nothing and there style and aggression just makes me like I can claw out of this hole  There music is very influenced by mental illness and has that chaotic feel but holy fuck it helps to listen to music as intense as alot of my moods when working out 
You too   
How do you feel about writing down what you're too afraid to say  I find that that helps me with that 
wish some people on this sub would understand that more  Being told to just play games to cope doesn't work when you remember how shitty video games are compared to other things in life 
How come  darling 
I was on a flight just two days ago  and halfway through there were some turbulences and the seatbelt signs lit back up  nothing unusual  But I started smiling like a madman because  as ridiculous and unlikely as I know it is  especially given that I'm a frequent traveler   the thought that the plane could at any point be on its way down  and I don't mean landing  and that it'll all be over crossed my mind 
You really seem like a good person  full of love  It's so hard for me to fathom why you feel like you suck  I GUARANTEE you  that you don't   I'm sure you have a lot of catching up to do  but you have 27 days  That is plenty of time to get it all done  I KNOW you can do it  It won't be easy  but when you do finish it  the elation will be second to none   I can hear and feel your depression spewing that negativity  That's not you  I know  I know  I'm just a stranger on the internet  I don't know the full gravity of your situation  But again  I GUARANTEE you that you have it in you   I really hope you see it in yourself that you can do it  It's there  not the slightest doubt in my mind 
Alcohol is a stimulant in low doses  I would not recommend it at all for anxiety  If you get a lot in your system it will become a depressant intoxicant  
You really are a pathetic waste of skin 
Thanks 
i would answer the same  to be happy  a therapist i knew said his goal was not to be happy  but rather to live fully  maybe this is more realistic  and braver too  i find it easy to confuse happiness with pleasure and convenience  which do offer temporary happiness  but i find more enduring happiness comes in other ways  a soulful conversation  time in nature  music  things that cost little or nothing  i notice that if i'm not disciplined about doing what i know makes me happy  i'm easily distracted by what society says will make me happy  working  buying stuff  and being in a  romantic relationship  sometimes those things contribute to my happiness  but they seem to equally contribute to my misery  so  my resolution is to pay more attention to what makes me happy  and do more of that 
You're not going through the same thing you shit heap  Now go laugh at rape victims like you always do 
i would  but i cant organize thoughts enough to hold a conversation  sorry
For me 2015 was the worst year and 2016 was damn near perfect up until the end  2017 just looks to continue this miserable path I'm on 
Here's to another year of being scared shitless of everything but doing it anyways   Remember  there's no bravery without fear  keep it up

The one supplement with the most consistent effect for me is sarcosine  1 5 grams daily and you're out of depression within a week  sometimes less  
I would like therapy  it can't afford it  And meditations make me nervous
Receiving a text releases hormones that makes you feel good inside as it is like you're having a "success" moment    I forgot the name of the exact hormone   dopamine  but it is the same as when you're gambling  drinking  smoking  blablabla   So it is totaly normal to feel good when you receive text because it feels like you're winning as someone is talking to you at a random moment  It makes you feel important  This is why some people are addicted to recieving texts 
Mine is to find a reason to live  Because I honestly don't think I'll still be alive to see 2018 
Do you have this  darling 
What did you take 
Well I'm sorry but your friends sounds like shit  Who does that  And I'm sorry that you feel like shit  Be careful with the drinking  try to keep track of how many drinks you've had  Write that shit down or type it in your phone  It may sound stupid but just doing it might help you drink less    I hope things get better for you  PM me if you wanna talk or anything
The "this year is going to be better mentality" is really exhausting 
As someone who drinks   a lot   to escape her OCD  which I'm perfectly aware is unhealthy   kind of   I still have my symptoms but I'm able to stay distracted and ignore them a lot more easily usually   If I don't keep myself distracted while drunk  however  I become hyper aware of my symptoms and get really depressed   
Are you still with us 
I hope you get the help you need OP  Hugs to you and hope you have a better 2017    
It's not just pain   it's numbness  loneliness  sadness  It's no happiness  I don't want to avoid it I just can't take it anymore  
I'd take pain  pain is good  When there's pain  there's pleasure  and when there's both there's life    The problem is when you just don't feel anything  Not pain  just a vague form of pity  and you're not sure why  But it's just always there  lingering  hollow  And it makes you feel hollow and vulnerable  like the smallest bump will cave you in  
Never a bad thing to share and reflect I guess  For whatever it's worth  here's to a better new year  
Hell yes  let's own this year 
I'm here for you  what's going on 
congrats buddy  I always feel nauseous but have not thrown up in a long time as well  It's the small victories 
Hanging yourself is not an option   No self harm is   Call suicide hotline and talk to someone    You are overwhelmed  we all are
I'm really hoping this is the case  Thank you for your perspective
I wish friends would text me  But im a boring loser  so why would they 
 removed 
Thank you  Happy New Year 
Being able to catch yourself in the act of bringing yourself down with your own thoughts is the hardest part of fixing this problem  Now you just need to learn some new thought patterns to break yourself out of that cycle  various forms of meditation can help   Good luck

I hope you can find your reason to live  I didn't think I'd be alive to see 2017  but somehow I made it  although I can't say I've found a reason to live yet  Stay strong 
My advice would be to try other therapists  Although it might feel nice to feel almost like you're friends with your therapist it's better to have a therapist who can guide you through your issues  
This is such a weird goal  but one I so relate to  I work in a professional setting  I'm decently presentable  But something about my depression just makes it so hard to brush my damn teeth    I'm so excited for you that you get to have this "one small thing"  
Is there any reason to seek help or get better  The primary aim of all living creatures is to maximize well being  Is there really any inherent value in that  Does anything have value  Does your depression and anxiety really matter  Nothing has value  negative or positive  until you attribute the value to the thing itself  Depression is neither inherently good or bad unless we deem it so  I find this somewhat liberating 
Maybe I'll start with genetics to test the waters  I'm generally skittish with opening up   Thank you for the advice  Happy New Year 
I ask myself this everyday  
Going through a similar thing  I think about her everyday it eats away at me but i still love her
I am here alone too  Just listening to classical music  It always makes me go to a land of fantasy  D 
I try to alternate weeks  one week I post a call for ideas  and the week after is when the assignment actually starts  I used to do this on Fridays but then accidentally it drifted to Thursdays 
Had an awful suicidal 2016  Hoping for a better 2017  when a few minutes in  my girl friend said she lost feelings for me  Guess I gotta wait till 2018  
No worries  Things can and I will turn around  I managed to fail 2 semesters and a summer semester and get kicked out of my mom house  I then worked for a semester and turned things around  There is always hope as long as you never give up  No matter how bad you screwed school up or even it feels like you'll never run distance again  The minute you doubt yourself  Any possible chance of hope is gone  Believe in yourself  you can recover  You aren't not a failure  You will come back from this hard time a much stronger person  You can do it  Never quit  Never stop believing  
Yep annoying 
From personal experience   alcohol makes you feel better when you're feeling  down  due to a certain incident  bad grade  relationship issue  etc    But if you're just having an overall  shitty  day due to depression  alcohol will   ONLY   make it worse 
How do you know your ugly

You did it  Congrats     You sound like an interesting guy  and I'm glad you overcame your fear of posting to share yourself with us  Good luck with your therapy 
This also applies to sports scores  If I doesn't go the way I envision  I could twitch in my eyes or other facial muscles  The numbers need to make sense    I know this sounds very odd

its main ingredient  mitragynin  is an opioid  and as such its addictive 
Because I don't like how I look 
The loneliness is likely part of the depression  ANYTIME a person is contemplating suicide it has to be taken seriously  It can be scary to open up to others and tell them how you are feeling   You said you are afraid of telling your parents  your parents will be greatly relieved that you told them how you are feeling so they can get you help  If  for some reason they brush off your being depressed  please talk to your school counselor the day you go back to school   The school counselor is trained to recognize the signs and symptoms of depression and the counselor can explain to your parents that the way you are feeling needs attention   Depression can leave one feeling very hopeless  Please know there is hope and you can feel better  You are not alone   This is a conversation that needs to take place with your parents now   Oh  and the phone    phones can be replaced   You and your wellbeing are far more important than a phone    
Hi friend  Its 1 04 where I am  I'm just checking in
Wish I had the courage to take my own life and make 2017 be my last year but I can't even do that
Had an awful suicidal 2016  Hoping for a better 2017  when a few minutes in  my girl friend said she lost feelings for me  Guess I gotta wait till 2018  
Things will get better  is of course bullshit  Things can get better  is completely true   I definitely relate to what you've said  Only I wish I could find good friends and have success with women  I believe that if I had those in my life  I would be happy  And while reading what you said makes me question that line of thinking  I still stand by it  Which brings me to my question  because I feel this is what's missing   What do you want to do in life  What makes you happy  
It's not like that  I've been in 73 hospitals this year  Its not like i've been here a few days  My illnesses don't have a cure
If you haven't achieved it yet maybe you should make your resolutions things that would make you happy  That's what I've learned about myself   I need to become independent and live my own life before I can be happy  Also self improvement  
Well shit  looks like you are in a really tough situation  You guys play games together and talk everyday  so I'm sure you mean something to her  you guys sound like friends    The thing is  if you can't stay friends with her without having strong emotions for her  then it might be best to stop talking to her  I know it sounds like shit but you can't live like this forever  You can't live loving someone for the rest of your life and having them not love you back  8 years is a long fucking time  but if you talk to other girls you'll either eventually get over her and find another girl you're into  Again  this probably sounds like shit  I was never in a situation where I liked a girl for 8 years but I was in a rocky relationship  and once I stopped talking to her after we broke up things started getting better  I was not constantly thinking about her  wanting to talk to her  wanting to do things for her  I just stopped thinking about her 95  of the time and you can too  It just takes a fuck load of time  but it's for the best for you  
Love you too man  happy new year 
Bout 40 sleeping spills so far and idk how many shots of vodka I know its hard to die from sleeping pills but im keeping mynfkngers crossed 
Don't listen to those jerks  People who say to just get over it doesn't understand depression  
Tonight this runs through my head 3 times per second   You could die right here and no one would know for over a week  I have no one left and it's starting to really scare me  
Thanks for sharing  I have some Sarcosine on hand but have not yet experimented  Have you tried Agmatine  If so  how does it compare to Sarcosine  Personally  it has helped me quite a bit  despite the stubborn nature of my anhedonia  
If you haven't already  you should see a psychiatrist

Dump her immediately  She bailed on you on a holliday to break the law with a friend  Fuck her  You don't need that shit  Yeah you love her  but you know what  You can live people who actually care too  Don't cut yourself man  you need a new way to express your sadness 
No  it's not  At all  It's ignorant  disrespect and insulting because those people have no fucking clue what you're going through  If it was as easy as flipping a switch  then wouldn't those same people think you would've done it a long time ago  You cant just be happy because you have no idea why you're unhappy  Even if you did  you have every right to feel the way that you feel  
I dunno how to get help
I've been putting it off for a year now but I think I'll go and see one soon  thanks for reading 
Description shows psychosis symptoms  Get help or you could loose months trying to march this off 
Well thanks
What exactly do you consider wrong about your appearance   It is an intrusive question  You don't have to answer if you don't want to 
I was alone  Thank you

I'm glad you are still here man  20 pills deep and drunk is not a good thing  Seriously  It's a new year  here is to making a new start  Me personally it was the first New Years Eve in 25 years I haven't been drunk  
You do deserve it  and I sincerely hope that things change in your favor for the new year  No one deserves to feel like they have no purpose  or a pointless life that they're stuck with  I'm rooting for you  man  
Don't  Give  Up  
Please don't
First half was one of my best years and I grew a lot as a person   I don't know what the fuck happened but the other half was definitely the worst of my life and I'm not even considering outside factors   My mind made it horrible 
this hurts so much do you really think she drank is there any chance she didnt  we have been in this relationship for two years
Hugs to you OP  How are you under attack  Verbally or Physically  I hope God grants you the strength to continue and endure until you find the right path 
None of my friends asked me to be with them for New Years  I'm visiting my parents for winter break  but even my best friend who's from my town is going to a party with my other friends that I wasn't invited to  Tonight was probably when I realized the true extent of how far I've fallen into depression  There doesn't seem to be a way out  I don't mean to make this about myself  but I can relate to your pain  You're not alone in suffering  even if it doesn't make your suffering any easier 
Similar situation  I bought a house a year ago because I was frustrated with renting and apartment living  But probably only enjoyed it for a couple of weeks before the regret and anxiety set in  There are all sorts of issues with it  and I'm now certain that i rushed into it and paid too much  Almost every night I wake up in the middle of the night with anxiety about it  I have nightmares about it  It's become my albatross  I wish I could undo it  but I'm stuck now  I think about suicide too  You are not alone 
I just recently wrote a blog post that I think may help you  http   ariaesthete com married anxiety guide happily ever  Good luck in your endeavors  
I'm guilty of  2 and 3  But that's only because I've been through it   the heartache after a failed relationship is many times more shitty than what you're feeling now   Knowing you had it and lost it for whatever reason   You're just going to blame yourself even more because that's what depression does  whether it's your fault or not   You need to understand how depression affects you and others around you before you pursue a relationship   Learn more about yourself   Read more about the disease   Learn how it manipulates your thoughts and emotions   Only then could you have some control over it   If you learn about the disease you can teach it to your future SO   And they can help you manage and control it   Otherwise if you can't help yourself  it's not realistic to expect them to make you feel better any and every time you're down   I say all this with the hope and optimism that depression can be managed and controlled 
Exact same place right now  20 and all
  The women I'm confident around I'm not attracted to  and the women I'm attracted to are too good for me   I have this problem as well   
When I was young  my mother was very abuse physically and mentally  I was bullied at school because my hair started falling out when I was in 1st grade  My best friend was a guy that would throw me under the bus every chance he got to seem cool to other people  I was a fat little fucker and I had problems trusting people  especially women  My depression worsened day after day  One day I decided that I had enough  I was tired of dealing with people  I was tired of trying to seem like a cool and good person  I was tired to trying to please everyone else  I said fuck it and fuck anyone that doesn't like me because I am going to live my life the way that I want  I am going to be the best person that I can be and I am going to get rid of anything or anyone in my life that gets in my way of being happy  My mom and dad got divorced when I was 10 and my dad got emergency custody of my siblings and I in 7th grade  I started drinking water instead of my regular 4 or 5 pops a day  I started watching how many calories I took in and started working out  I studied harder in school and started getting better grades  When I was living with my mother  I loved to figure out how things worked  I would sometimes break things just so that I could show my mom and she would let me take it apart  I know I shouldn't have broke things as a child   I started to try to build things and I messed a lot of stuff up  but I learned from my mistakes  I kept going  I got to really know my dad after my parents got divorced  I never got to see him much before as he was always working to provide for us  We lived in a little apartment for a long time until my dad built a house  I didn't have a lot at first  but I had my dad  I remember wearing my dads shirts that were way too big for me to school in 7th and 8th grade  I learned how to live cheaply  Buying nice clothes at yard sales for a couple dollars  My father and I would stay up until 12 or even 1 building end caps out of fiberglass for a trailer company that he worked for  We worked our asses off and we started to build something for ourselves  My dad like to fix wrecked vehicles and he traded many things for tools and equipment  Today we have our own body shop and we have cars lined up waiting to be fixed and sold right now  The only thing that I know to tell you is that you must find at least one thing in your life that you love and let it motivate you  Set goals for yourself  Find out what you want to do with your life  You have to stop living for others and start living for yourself  You must strive and work hard to reach your goals and you can't let anything get in your way  It's a hard road and it is never easy  There are going to be many obstacles and trials that come your way and you are going to feel like giving up  I can't begin to tell you how many times I wanted to just lay in bed all day and just be lazy  but I let the things that I love be my motivation  No one can do it for you  I know that things are going to happen and you are going to want to blame others or blame something for the failure or the sadness  but you must learn from the bad and use it to help you reach the good  It is not an easy battle especially when facing depression  I can only hope and pray for the best for you  I hope that one day you can find your happiness in life and I know that if you get motivated that you will  You are facing a battle that many people face  but you can do it and don't let anyone tell you any different 
Lots of things that add up but the biggest is that I've already lost almost all my hair and I'm only 24  I did start shaving it which helps  but my shit hairline is still obvious and I just hate how I look bald  I grew a beard but it turned out to be super sparse and ginger  my normal hair was brown   I'm also  extremely  white which doesn't help the bald look   Even if there are people that don't consider me ugly   I  still do and I'm not sure that will ever change  Everything about my appearance is the opposite of what I think is good looking 
Just hang in there  You can do it  It will be worth it once the side effects wear off  and they will wear off  The worst is usually only about a week 
Maybe it is for the best  but i don't think i have a say in this anymore  I have an edging feeling someone else has confessed to her and she accepted them  I have a feeling that she won't be talking to much as much or even at all anytime soon if my suspicion is right  Maybe this is the best path for me to stop having feelings for her  after all  i just want her to be happy   I don't really talk to other girls  i am a pretty introverted person  when i do  i never show interest in them since all i can ever think of is her  it does feel like shit  I feel like time doesn't heal  only lets you forget  Sigh     
You sound like a beautiful person  And I am not talking about appearance  but rather your character  You want to be healthier to help others  and that is something I truly admire in you  The world needs more people like you 
I can't help but feel that people are becoming more and more isolated as time goes by  To those on here who live in the west  I just want you to know that it is not entirely your fault if you're feeling lonely  In the Western world  capitalism is the new religion and the workplace is the new church  except we go there to work and compete  not to bond together and worship  The free time we used to use for face to face socializing is rapidly being intermediated by technology  Our government's social nets allow us to rely on the state to take care of us when we need it  instead of our family  and so there is less incentive to have strong family bonds  Capitalism demands us to set out on our own and achieve material wealth so we can consume endlessly  not spend time with our family and friends  Of course you don't have to submit to this  but that doesn't change the fact that everyone else is too busy working or too tired to meet up  On that note  to those who are motivated there are still many ways to meet new friends  Good luck in 2017 
Thanks I'm going to schedule an appointment with an allergy specialist and see what's up  Thanks for the advice 
What kind of shows are those 
Take a nap 
I've gone through periods experiences in life where I was absolutely  100  sure I was never gonna recover from    I was convinced that I had broken or was just cracked    And then I somehow made it out   The human ability to endure is actually spectacular   Now  If i just believed I could recover in the big picture  that would really be something 
Fuck same and every birthday wish I make as well 
i was talking to my counselor  and she told me to try changing things a little at a time  for example  if you normally wash your hands for 5 minutes  stop after 3  then as you become acclimatized to 3  slowly whittle your time down in that same manner until it's at a "socially acceptable"  awkward phrase  more like  a normal  healthy level     it shows you that ocd is not unchangeable and that you do have a say in how things go   your rituals do not have to be rigid and control you  this is how i dealt with my ocd in terms of handwashing for the most part
I know how you feel  Getting help is of course the most important thing you can do for yourself  so take pride in that because a lot of people refuse help  Practicing self care is not something to just sweep under the rug  That is an amazing  brave step  You have to acknowledge that  Do some soul searching  What is it that you think will make you truly happy  Forget about having a decent job  women to date and all those other "norms" that equate those things to true happiness  Sure they're important  but what is going to give  you  drive and passion  What is going to make  you  ecstatic to live the life you do  I hope that you find it  Please  please  please  Don't give up  If it means anything  I'm rooting for you  
Had an awful suicidal 2016  Hoping for a better 2017  when a few minutes in  my girl friend said she lost feelings for me  Guess I gotta wait till 2018  
Are you asking if you were raped by your mother's boyfriend  Or your friend 
That's terrible advice  
Count me in  I started hysterical crying because not only am I sick  but I just feel so alone and am depressed all the goddam time  I'm happy that 2016 is over  but I'm terrified of what this year is going to have in store for me  I'm not saying I want my life to be perfect with zero bumps in the road  but I so desperately need things to go easier on me  I need some good things to happen to me  I need good people to come into my life  promise to stay and actually stay  I don't know how much more pain  and disappointment I can take  
My resolutions are to lose a bunch of weight  get a job  move out  and start HRT  which would also mean having to talk to a therapist   Surprise  it's the same one as last year  I really hope it sticks this time  I don't know how much longer I can go on like this   Oh  and on a less depressing note  I want to learn guitar and maybe write a couple songs  
 nods   I came off the drugs in '16 because they were doing me more harm than good    shit's been rough man   Never been to this sub before  so I don't know how y'all do it here  but I'm not new to the state of mind    at all 
Same  I actually thought I was going to have plans  for once  but he decided to hang out with some other people instead  
This is super relatable  I'm awful at replying to texts because I find the interaction exhausting  It's like  on one hand I prefer texting to face to face conversations but then part of me is like 'well we're not actually hanging out so its okay if I drop the conversation randomly as soon as I get tried of it '   I'm constantly at war with myself because I definitely need people to keep texting me so I know they don't hate me or whatever but then I also wish people would stop texting me so I could stop feeling like shit every time I drop a conversation  I hate this
Just ask for help  no one truly knows what to do  but some people are there to help others get going in the right direction  I've been in the same position and the only reason why I'm still going is that I want to see what's next  It sounds cliche  but it's true  it really does get better  Pm me if you want to talk  I'm all ears  
I feel ya man  Had an awful suicidal 2016  Hoping for a better 2017  when a few minutes in  my girl friend said she lost feelings for me  Guess I gotta wait till 2018  
I wonder the same 
I feel ya man  I love this sub because it's helpful to know people out there are going through the same thing 
yeah     it's definitely a struggle but we'll all get through this  cheers to finding someone else who understands though 
I'm an existentialist  which is basically just a slightly more optimistic nihilist  Nothing matters  but we can basically give things meaning ourselves  even if it's just bullshit 
Yup  Today has been horrible  
Is your post still up  Do you have a link to it or can you give me the gist of it    Also I'm not entirely sure what your question is  Are you asking why his comments got removed 
I used to get really crossfaded a lot  I would just drink a ton and then smoke weed afterwards  I did it because smoking weed after getting near blackout drunk made me black out completely and I didn't have to feel anything  Im not sure if you are in the same boat and if you're abusing drugs for the same reasons but this is what i did  I went through counseling through my school  and I was able to get medication through a psychiatrist eventually  The counseling helped and the medication  lexapro  is what helped me not feel like shit anymore  but I feel emotionless now  I don't know if that is because of the medication though  But the medication was totally worth it  Even if it did make me emotionless because now I'm not crying everyday and feeling like a complete worthless person like I was before  Sorry I sound like I'm ranting but I think seeking counseling or therapy would be a good thing to try  Talking to someone helps 
Many attractive men are bald or almost bald  I understand you would prefer to have more hair  and I believe there are treatments for that  but being bald is not a deal breaker  I am not a woman  but honestly I don't think they care much    There are guys out there who look disgusting  ugly would be a compliment   are totally out of shape and don't even have that much money and they have beautiful girlfriends 
I'm doing the exact same thing    classical and standards  
Yep  6th year in a row where ive come to bed around 10ish and cry   Lots of things have been going on  Im unhappy with my job  teacher   im not the parent my son deserves  He deserves so much better  Im tired of everyone saying that things will get better  Nothing has  Im almost 31 and still live with my parents  I work 2 jobs and still do not come close to being able to move out   Im so fucking sick of this shit 
I hope this year treats you well  Thank you for saying this  
Because being in love isn't a long term cure  the depression will come back   It always does   And if you're not educated on how it affects you and others around you  the relationship will not work   The least you can do is read more about it   Get counselling   And just really work on yourself before you seek out a relationship  After the honeymoon period of a relationship wears off and you become comfortable and complacent with each other  you will find you are annoyed with many little trivial things that your SO does   At first you may think they are annoying and that they don't understand you   "Why can't they just make you happy "  you will ask yourself   "Shouldn't they know you by now  "  But really it's the depression fucking with you and you not noticing it  because you are associating the symptoms of depression with whatever you are doing in your life   So you will blame your shitty feelings on everyone around you but yourself   You will alienate yourself from others because they don't understand you and how right you are and how stupid they are   Depression warps and manipulates your thoughts   That's why I suggest really really working on yourself first   I hope with this post you will be motivated to learn more about depression and the causes and triggers and how you can avoid it the best you can   And you seeking a relationship and you actively working on yourself are NOT mutually exclusive  I'm not denying the benefits of a relationship   HOWEVER  if shit does not work out  which most likely won't for first relationships   the depression and emptiness and anger and nothingness is SO MANY TIMES greater than whatever you are feeling now 
I'm sorry that your meds aren't helping  and that you feel that your mother isn't taking you seriously  Are there any local youth mental health groups that you can contact  Not sure which country you are in so can't offer specific advice there  Also do you have a school counsellor or someone that you can talk to  You really need to try to open up more  as hard as that is  people cannot help if they don't know the true extent of what is happening  Also given that you have been given medication  it seems that you are being taking seriously  as your mother has taken you to a doctor and gotten you meds  Perhaps just talk to her again  wrote a letter  send an email  anything that makes it easier for you to tell her how bad you're feeling  It may be that she just doesn't know the extent of things  Also I don't think that anyone will look at you as a druggy and not prescribe medication  
I got out for New Years and loved it   It was my first time out for a new years at all    I usually stay inside and do nothing  be we drank milkshakes and talked for hours  I had next to no anxiety besides driving home  I've resolved to get out more this year and hopefully I'll commit to the change    It's the small victories that count  happy new year  r anxiety  
Happy new year's to you 
Happy new year  I hope it treats you well   
Great idea  I'm going for a drive 
I've got a loaded 30 06 in the closet   One bullet in the chamber for me   I look at it from time to time but I'm too afraid to even touch it

Every year that I'm still alive is a bad year 
i'm sorry that this happened to you     when you say that it could've been worse  i hope you realise that you deserved way better than that  because nobody should have to deal with any of that    you're not to blame either  thanks for sharing   cheers     you're making progress and doing your best  and that's all that matters   all the best to you 
Same  I'm pathetic  
Just think  when you make it in life  and you will  I know you will  3  that you earnt it  You deserved it more than anyone else  You struggled through everything and still managed to come out on top  Yes  it's true that there are people out there how are in a better situation than you  how have more opportunities but that doesn't make them predisposed to win  to come out on top  Life is about adaption and how you react to the different contexts you are put in  Making it to where YOU WANT to be is the ultimate goal  you can't compare it with anyone else's goals  We all want different things and yes it's true there will be people who are smarter than you  more confident than you  come from a richer family  But like I said  you adapt  you figure it out and you take the opportunity  you take the chance and you prove yourself to the world  I come from a really rough part of the UK notorious for never amounting to anything  But I worked hard  harder than everyone else because I knew what I wanted and how to get there  There were people who were clearly way smarter than me  braver than me  less shy  more charming than me  But perseverance is key and I'm where I always wanted to be  studying linguistics   And if your parents DO feel depressed because of you  well  that's their loss       Stay strong 
I don't think this is silly at all  What do you want to happen  Do you want to be able to feel comfortable going out of your room when people are there  or are you fine the way you are  but just feel "stupid" for acting that way  Like what is the desired outcome here 
I was  and unfortunately still am  in your exact situation  except I'm 24 and it's really bad   I'd say go see a psychologist  yes I know you said you don't want to but trust me I didn't either and I ended up really enjoying it   I went to a doctor recently and he put me on propranolol but I haven't seen much of a difference   At least not yet   I'm sorry this isn't a helpful comment  I always recommend everyone to try meditation because it's great for relaxing and calming yourself down  Good luck 
I'll tell you my story  maybe someone on here will be able to relate  maybe not   I've never been good at feeling close to people  I had a best friend for many years  over a decade  We met in middle school  and continued our friendship into our mid 20's  But he became addicted to drugs and alcohol and spiraled out of control  I tried to help him  I let him treat me like shit  I stood by him when nobody else did  I was his only friend  The only reason I stuck around as long as I did is because he was the only person in the world who I could be myself around  my true self  When I spent time with him  the world felt shiny and new again  nothing was impossible  and life was an adventure  Two years ago though he fell off the wagon again after having been sober a while  He started being cruel to me  really tried to tear me down as a person despite me being his only real ally and friend  I finally cut ties with him and told him to fuck off  Fast forward to 10 months ago and he hurt some people real bad while fucked up on who knows what  His trial is in a few weeks  He is pleading insanity  but it likely won't work and he will end up in prison for the majority of his life   Despite all of that  a day doesn't go by that I don't miss him terribly because without him I can't be me anymore  at least not around other people  I just spent the night around family and whatnot  and it left me feeling so drained and alone and wanting desperately to just talk to my best friend again  My current lineup of friends don't give a rats ass about me  Most of them only talk to me when they want need something from me  In the last two months I haven't bothered to start conversations with most of them since I'm always the one having to start the conversations  In that time the two people I considered to be the best of my friends have barely spoken to me  One of them has sent me about 5 sentences of messages  and 4 of those sentences were asking for advice on technology  This was someone I talked to daily and gamed with all the time  My other friend has messaged me maybe once in those two months  My existence is increasingly becoming a lonely one 
Hi   I don't think anyone will read this  or really care  since this is mostly just a dumping thread for all of our emotions    I will probably say too much  and people will skip the long post   I am 20  female  I consider myself attractive and witty  I love my personality  I love myself  But do I    2017 has begun  I have now lost two SOs from an opiate addiction  I have lost my best friend from alcoholism  I have lost countless friends to prescription drugs in the past few years    I have lost interest in everything  I danced for 13 years  have always been creative and artistic  An excellent painter  photographer  cinematographer  always had an eye for art and design  I don't care about any of that anymore    I wake up every day at 1pm  exhausted by 6pm  can't sleep until 4am  Wake up multiple times throughout the night  If I don't smoke I'm plagued by nightmares  Just last night I watched my parents die in my dreams  If I do smoke  I'm numb to the world around me  and my grades begin to drop    When I am alone  the isolation cripples me  I'm left to my own anxious thoughts  worrying over things I can't tell if they're serious or not  If I should be worrying or if it's just anxiety  I can't tell    When I'm with people  I feel as if everyone is talking about me  Judging me  Then immediately feel like I'm conceited  thinking anyone pays me any attention at all  Why would anyone care what I'm doing    I lost 20 pounds this year  I don't let myself eat  any excess fat I notice is a shame  and so are the bones when I see them poking through my skin  Especially my pelvic bone through my back  or my rib cage and my bony chest    I don't remember what excitement feels like  Like I said  I am attractive  I meet guys easily  I have an awesome personality  I think  But when they realize how unstable I am  the extent of my anxiety  the never ending self doubt and exhaustion    they're gone  I'm alone    I'm lucky if I shower three times a week  Sometimes I don't get out of bed for whole days  Most times I just get out of bed and move to the couch    I wish I had a therapist  someone to talk to  My friends are tired of listening  my problems are my own and they shouldn't be burdened with them  But I need someone to care    I tried to kill myself on October 20th  My roommate called the cops  they took me to the ER  where the psychiatrist asked me why I was feeling suicidal  and when I began to explain  he told me he didn't understand why I would feel so upset over little things    Because of what I look like physically  no one will ever take me seriously  No one  I'm expected to be happy  I don't remember what happy feels like  The week following my suicide attempt  the person I was seeing told me that I needed help and that he couldn't be the shoulder I needed to cry on    I keep telling myself that my happiness is in my own hands  I can be my own shoulder  I can make the difference in my life    I wonder if it's okay to admit that's not true  I can't do it on my own anymore    I'm so tired  I want to sleep  But I don't want to wake up in this world    I'm sorry for this long post  I left my journal at home    Please let this end  I just want to sleep  I just want to stop crying  I just want to live throughout the day  I don't want to feel like brushing my teeth is an obstacle to face  I don't want to drown anymore  Please  I have no answers    Please let it end 
There is no better way to dismiss someone than just slapping the SJW label 
You can tell us your story  if you want  Nobody is here to judge you 
God it fucking sucks  especially today when you realize how you've been alone like this for your entirety on earth  I just wish I could find one special someone to spill my heart out to  or something  I feel like we all have to go through this alone and we'll never see each other so all we have is our thoughts and the things we read 
Any diagnosis takes time  there are so many mental illnesses that have overlapping symptoms  and it's not as simple as going to one appointment and coming out with a diagnosis  It takes a while and you need to stick with your doctor psychiatrist and work with them  be open and honest and give them some time to connect all the dots and figure things out    I think your changing personality is just a coping mechanism  and it helps to keep your anxiety levels down  Have you tried explaining any of this to your boyfriend  
keep it going my man    happy new year buddy  all the best to yoou  don't neglect your teeth of all things  that shit wont heal   lovely to hear you're taking care of them again  and if youre doin it for a month straight then i assume you'll keep on doin it   you should    all the best to you man     i should probably add that i am actually chuck norris  for real  so pay attentention to what i say  keep goin down the path you're on   it's a good one  HAPPY NEW YEAR
Thanks  I don't really know what undepressed people do that I don't though

So your parents saw you running around in a panic  they called out to you  you didn't hear  and they let this go on for 30 minutes without chasing you down or getting close enough for you to hear them 
This thought comes to mind basically whenever I see someone on social media posting about a party or something  Thank you for letting a lot of us know we are not alone  
Same 
Love you back  happy new year 
It's not that bad     if you can afford it  Maybe return it if you can 
I can see why you're stressed  But I think you should at least try to apply for jobs  don't assume that because you have no experience no one will be interested  everyone has to start somewhere  The bottom line here is that if you want to live in the same city as your partner  then you need to start applying for jobs  as overwhelming as you're finding that  I can assure you that burying your head in the sand and ending up with no job  living in a different city to your loved one will be a lot more stressful  Just think about what you want  you want to be near your partner  so you need to try and make that happen  
Comedy Bang Bang is the best   It's gotten really weird and hard to get into   But I super recommend it  especially if you can do it from the start   It is really surprising just how much they never turn down an idea and how completely wacky things get sometimes   SPONTANEANATION is really good because they have a little joking interview with the guest  then improv working in things they talked about   They are both exactly my kind of goofy  wacky comedy 
Pretty similar  I'm usually drinking hot tea or ice cold water  watch a movie catch up on a tv show  or read on my kindle   Reddit all day 
I doubt you've had the best tasting meal on the planet 
I think 2016 was at least tied for if not fully the worst year of my life  but the way I'm trying to look at it is like this  I've been through the hellfire  All the worst that could happen felt like it did  there was death  heartbreak  anxiety  depression  fear  and pain  and 2017 literally can't be worse unless everyone else I know gets hit by meteors  Literally  So with that in mind  I'm trying to be hopeful  I'm trying to look at it like the physical therapy after a horrible car crash or something  it's still gonna be hard and it's gonna be uncomfortable and take a lot of adjustment  but overall  it's going to be healing I hope  It's hard but I hope it's going to be a better year 
Don't be so hard on yourself  Those things aren't as simple as clicking your fingers and being a different person  It's a long process  and you shouldn't feel so disheartened  you have 364 days left to succeed  
You didn't already blow it  Those are all wonderful resolutions  just try again tomorrow  Having a bad day doesn't mean it's the end  it just means you had a bad day and to try again tomorrow  "But every day is a bad day  " Yes yes   So work on that  what would improve your days  Need to calm yourself  Do deep breathing and meditation  then return to your task once you've calmed down   Smile at yourself in the bathroom mirror  trust me it helps   hey even laugh out loud  alone of course   go full on Tidus  props if you know FFX   You can also try the yoga pose Lifting the Sky  it's an amazing way to calm down    I hope I helped  chin up friend  you haven't already failed  you just slipped on some January ice and have stood back up 
I'm emotionally numb  yet on some level there is what I can only describe as a sort of hatred or contempt for seemingly everybody  I can't actually feel these things as feelings per se  What I experience  rather  is this urge to criticize  I don't have the emotional energy to express that urge  to organize my thoughts into words  but it's always there  this running list of all the things people are doing wrong  all the things about people that are wrong  Sometimes it's closer to the background  It hasn't been today

Love you too  stranger   Honestly  I just come here when I'm depressed because giving others advice makes me feel better  This sub helps me more than I could ask for  
I've been feeling really hollow and empty the past week  The past 6 weeks I feel like i've just stalled and it's unbearable at times    I wish I could just turn my mind off when I want to

I feel the same way   ive basically prayed that I'd die for Christmas for the past 4 years  and when that didn't happen I'd hope it'd be my birthday gift  I've been stuck in that spiral of "please don't let me live to see the next       " for what feels like ages  I sure hope something comes along for you to help you escape this hell we live in  wish you the best friend 
Thank you  When I wrote that I was just feeling so terrible and down and I'm really going to look into what you said here  Its just hard for me because even if a family member just knocks on my door and tells me dinner is ready or something I feel my heart beating rapidly and my throat closing up  Thanks though for real 
At 12 00 I cried tears of happiness because for some reason I felt strongly that there was a chance things would pick up this year  At 12 05 I was slitting my wrists because all my old friends were sending me pictures of them being together and enjoying life  Fuck everything 
Be yourself  Yeah OK  which one  
Get off the alcohol and any drugs  they destroy everything  stop drinking and taking pills it's all bullshit  trust me  All they do is make it worse  especially when you're trying to quit    
Because you still have hope left in you  You want to be happy  It's still possible  It might take a lot of work  but you can do it    Oh  and you're awesome  
Try inviting them to hangout next time  Sometime you have to grasp the moment and not let it come because it never will 
Are you okay 
I've not found that to be the case   Though that's not to say that working hard is any better 
Rather not be rejected
End what  
Wait five years  9 times out of 10 you'll be happier later  You just have to stick around through the rough  
I'm out at a bar around random people tonight because I'm afraid of what I might do if I'm not  I've never had some story tale kiss you at midnight situation but I'd like to  But I recall many a night watching the ball drop while I was by myself  Now I'm just by myself in a room full of people  Maybe next New Years  Good luck next year to you too   
It could be a million things  It could be nothing  Are these "symptoms" always random  Do they appear when you're stressed or worried about something  Do they get worse when you notice them 
Yeah  but that's like saying "enjoy being stabbed while it lasts because you won't get stabbed forever" 
I'm so proud of you  I have anxiety toward doctors and medical facilities  and I've had to do exactly what you did today  I know just how hard it can be  so please believe me when I say that I'm incredibly proud of you

Oh definitely shouldn't put it off if you haven't tried it yet  I started dealing with panic attacks early last January  Started taking meds in March  Meds definitely help  
When did this all start  
Oh for fuck's sake 
I have no other way to say this other than it'll only hurt more if you don't try  Look if you keep doing this  college will  no  it is the same except you have freedom 
Thank you  wish the same for you 
Hey  Still thinking of you and sending my love

I'm sure that there is a real number out there  But I came to say that everyone is at some point  Everyone goes through struggles and tries to hide it  Be kind to everyone because you never know what's going on in their lives  Your not the only depressed one  There are many others  They just express it differently 
Don't know what to tell you  I'm kind of in the same boat  Earlier the thing I thought was that the only thing that would fix my pain and my problems was a bullet  So I decided to go be around people and went to a bar  So here I am  We've made it so far  We've made it another year and another chance  That's something right 
I hope you didn't go through with this but if you did  godspeed  but I really hope you didn't    I hope you find on the other side what you are looking for   If you wake up today PM me  please   Let me know you are ok and we'll talk 
yeah  I take meds for depression and anxiety  and I liked it cause i was better  But now they just make me feel worse and weak  idk how to explain it
Understandable  But when your 60yo  and you look back at your life  I guarantee you'll say "I wish I asked them to hangout" 
Glad I'm not the only one  Why is it so hard  It's like a sign I know when I'm really feeling better  when I do  I will start to brush my teeth  It's almost funny  Anyway  keep it up bro  Or ma'am  
I can relate with all u just said  I wanna get rid of my brain too   I fucking hate depression 
I had a similar experience today  I asked people to hang out today for New Years  also a senior  and was turned down by everyone  then found out later people I had asked went somewhere else to hang with each other
Literally the only reason I'm still alive is my parents  I'm not sure how they'd feel if they knew that  But they are the only reason I'm still here  My mom and my dad would have to identify my body  And that hurts me so bad to know  My mom and dad already had to bury one child  I don't think they could survive the loss of another one  So here I am  And they have no idea  
that's a good question  Ideally I want to be the kind of room mate that is social  has dinner with them every once in a while  but I also just   like to be on my own  It's so odd to me but it makes sense  The guilt comes from feeling like I have this obligation that since I live with them I need to hang out with them  be friends  etc  
Good job bro  we're proud of you

Do people get texts like that  I haven't gotten a single one either 
Meaning isn't meaning unless you believe in it   Telling yourself "X is meaningful" is way different than actually believing X is meaningful   And that's why existentialism is bullshit   To the extent that it means anything  it's just a post hoc rationalization for doing what you were already motivated to do in the first place

Sorry about that    Love is a really nasty thing sometimes  It's awesome that you want her to be happy  but yeah  of course you're not going to feel good at the same time    Hey  I promise it does get better with time though  I'm pretty introverted too  and I am horrible at speaking with people I don't know that well  I got lucky  and I was able to get a job that allowed me to work with other people my age  Eventually in a year or so I went from being almost completely mute to being able to have conversations with people on a regular basis    I think I sort of get what you mean when you say you don't show interest in people when you talk  I had the almost the same feeling as well  When I talked to people before  I did not give a fuck about them  They saw a movie over the weekend  Okay  They like to play the piano  Okay  They enjoy going on hikes during breaks  Okay  But eventually I started asking questions about it  I had to fucking force myself  but I did  You watched a movie  What movie  Oh you play the piano  What kind of songs do you play   You like to go hiking  What's a good hiking trail around here  Eventually  I realized that people have interestings things to say  But not only that  you get to learn from these people and apply the newly learned knowledge into other conversations as well  Oh you went hiking on this trail  I heard about it that trail blah blah    Sorry that I'm ranting my ass off right now  I just wanted to share that I was shit at talking  but now I'm alright  And once you start talking with people it got a lot better for me    I understand that this shits hard especially when all you can do is think about her  But with time it does get better  And hey  maybe with time it lets you forget  but maybe that will heal you along the way     And maybe with enough time  you can think of the happy memories you had with her without getting sad  
Happy New year bro

Hmmm  Sort of  When I'm at work  where I should be stressed the most  it's almost always not there    But the most recent trigger was receiving a bad news  and my heart rate just went up and my head started feeling heavy  So yes  maybe stress bad news can be a cause   Lastly  yes  the more I pay attention to it  the worse it feels  Exercise usually helps  or sleeping

That was a great read  thank you  
Does anyone else feel like me  I don't want to have fun and "maximize pleasure"  It's bullshit anyways  Dopamine to eat and have sex so people can stay on this goddamn planet forever  Sometimes I can convince myself there's a God but it's been getting hard  especially coming off of the prozac     I know deep down now all we get is oblivion  You work your ass off  repopulate  and die  For what  Why should I have to live knowing it's all meaningless  
Much love man  3 
I don't think most 13 year olds' "emotional issues" comprise contemplating suicide  Suicidal ideation is a serious issue and anyone who mentions it should be taken seriously 
There are worse things out there to deal with anxiety  at least weed is only bad for your lungs  if you smoke it   It isn't corroding your liver like booze or frying your brain like benzos  
Any books  movies  or sources you recommend to get more insight on this  
Yep   heard it all before  "You know it's not real" "just stop thinking" "just make yourself stop" "stop pretending" "just relax" "pull toe head out of your ass"  I really wish people wouldn't be so narrow minded and judgmental just because they don't understand it  
Happy new year 
Im supposed to start at midnight but came in at 8pm  Thanks though 
I don't know what you're going through but that's exactly how I feel right now 
 mitragynine  Yes  it can cause withdrawals if used daily for an extended period of time  but so can antidepressants like Effexor and run of the mill drugs like caffeine  And every prescription antidepressant  and while we're at it  caffeine  has a higher risk of toxicity than kratom  Zero deaths have been attributed to kratom in isolation  whereas I see people who fatally OD on Xanax  SSRIs  and alcohol every day at work  often in combination but frequently by themselves    Nothing is without risk  But by and large the benefits of kratom greatly outweigh the risks for many many people  Kratom has been a godsend for me and so many others  It's a tragedy that the DEA has been running a full throttle smear campaign in a desperate power grab  Please check out the American Kratom Association to learn a little more about this amazing plant  
It definitely sounds like you could be experiencing some sort of anxiety  My advice would be to try and see your doctor  perhaps get a referral to a therapist  or even a CBT or DBT program  Hotlines are good too  as are subs like this where you can talk to people who understand  Also look mindfulness for anxiety  it may help you  Lastly  if you ever need someone to talk to  please don't hesitate to inbox me  
Currently taking gabapentin   75mg in the morning and 150mg at night  during the first two weeks anxiety decr eased but a month later   I feel anxiety symptoms palpitations  the drug is working maybe at 70   I believe the decrease in efectivity it is due to tolerance buildup  
Happy New Year  
I wish it made me happy all the time  I'd have a reason to drink what I do  GOod luck buddy 
Have you considered that it might just have been a misunderstanding    Besides  you have Internet  so there is lot of ways to entertain yourself XD
yeah pretty much
Might be side effects  Worth mentioning to your doctor about it and possibly try something else
Had been going great since the summer  School had been keeping me busy  i got back together wuth my girlfriend and was doing ok  Idk what happened last night    just feeling pretty hollow now  Meh 
Happy New Year
What happened here   o O
Are you regretting anything specific  or is it just a general sense of regret about nothing in particular  those are always fun   
I'm sorry you feel this  I have it too right now and I can say it's not fun at all  If you need to vent I'm here   and hope you find some solace somewhere
They're all being deleted ahaha I don't know why  it'll happen in the next few minutes   EDIT  Seems this is the only comment not deleted haha 
Hey man he's just trying to see if the person is still there  Don't bash him for asking a question 
6 for me yay 
Hi  We can talk 
I don't think you were too sensitive at all  I think it's perfectly reasonable to be upset about the way he went about that  Saying he was "just being honest" is BS   he was being rude and abusive and if that's how he treats people who do him favours then he really doesn't deserve them    I hope you are feeling ok  Please don't be hard on yourself 
This happened to me too  First half of the year I contributed in starting a company  got a better job and started dating  Second half  well my scumbag brain sabotaged every effort I made at anything and I finished the last 3 4 months feeling lost  suicidal and alone   overall  worst year ever even given the new job etc   
Understood  For what it's worth  my suggestion would be to go with whatever seems to be working best for you  Sometimes things like this only come to the surface when people's lives are going well in other respects    when the psyche finally is assured that it's safe to address the matter  But some victims don't feel the need to address it at all  and as long as that doesn't involve the expenditure of large amounts of mental effort to keep the lid on things  it's as correct a response as any other 
Lexapro really helps me  It at least takes the edge off  As mentioned below it does kill your libido though   Also  no good doctor would describe benzos long term  they're too addictive and the more you take  the more you need  
Happy new year my man  I'm here like we survived 2016  Give me a medal  shit  
Honestly man I feel like we were unlucky enough to develop defective brains one way or another  I'm like that defective product of nature that should be dead but medications are keeping me alive 
They fill the void    Find something to obsess over   Find something that you enjoy and can improve upon   Learn an instrument   Go to the gym  Buy a multi player online videogame   Whatever you do try to actively enjoy it    Keep trying to add variety into your life and what you like will stick  
i really appreciate you taking time to help me see that my way is apparently working  Thank you so much   
Yep  losing contact to 3 people who are close to me means that I have no one to express my feelings to anymore  That much regarding "friends forever" 
Seventh grade was the start but it all started coming down just this year a few months ago to where I can't handle the constant feeling of terrible anxiety and wanting to throw up even if I'm just alone 
I feel you  Having same exact problem here too  Trying to fix it but no solutions to be seen   
why the late reply 
Omg this is so weird      I thought I was really the only one who thought about stuff like this      like sometimes it's just a battle to just not think about it for fear that thinking about it will make it happen       I am really blown away by this 
Most people are fine and happy that's why  Also times have changed there's less purpose in life we are cogs in a machine making money for people who own things  we are useless to society if we die then no one will in society would miss us we would get replaced easily  you have to fit in even if you don't  keep wearing that mask and don't you dare take that mask off you don't want people to be disgusted by you when you are already so alone  The world generally seems to become a less hospitable place for us 
If you're gone  I hope you finally find peace on the other side and I'm sorry you couldn't find it here   If you're still here  I believe that would be a sign that you're stronger than you think and you're meant to tough it out for as long as you can  I really hope its the latter and you're still around  As hopeless as it seems  your story definitely seems like you have a lot to live for  even though the negatives seem to block out all of the positives 
I lived with my in laws  and they ate dinner together every night at 5 30 as a family  I was used to living alone and eating alone  I hated going to make food when anyone was around  and even hated using the toilet  As soon as it started getting closer to dinner time  I would get more and more anxious  and when 5 30 came  I would feel awful  heart beating out of my chest  feeling sick and have red blotches all over my face and neck  my biggest anxiety sign   The last thing I wanted to do was eat  BUT I forced myself to go out there  I couldn't manage it every day  but I tried as much as I could  Eventually it got a little easier  but I'm not going to lie and tell you I was cured  Perhaps just start small  if you hear someone out in the kitchen  go out and get some water  look in the fridge  say hi  then go back to your room  Keep on doing it until eventually  hopefully  it is easier for you  Just little by little start interacting more  and hopefully you'll get more comfortable  If all else fails  do you think you could stand forcing yourself to eat a meal with them very now and then 
Ahhhh yeah I was feeling the same way then I got a text   Turns out it was someone messaging me literally at 12 02am to ask me if I can fix their laptop    Lol     Oh well  What can you do when you live in a shoe 
Read it  Don't apologize  You came to the right place I think  I'm too terrified to tell my parents  The one person I told  he blew me off  I think I'll keep it to myself from now on  
I think you can definitely live a meaningful life as a recluse  if that's what you meant   You should adopt something that make it worthwhile at least though  an art  If anything being alone gives you a lot time to work on what you love most 
It sounds like anxiety to me  And my guess is that you don't feel anxious when working exercising sleeping because you're distracted  So when you start to feel anxious  perhaps try distracting yourself with something  Or mindfulness meditation  It works for some people  
Right there with you
Maybe this will be worth nothing but watch six feet under  you reminded me of Keith 
It's funny  Usually I take bars because they they make me happy  Lately they haven't been   I just care less  Care less about my life  Guess I need a new drug   I'll take it one day at a time  Hopefully you do the same  Maybe we'll be in a different sub next year  
I see you OP  Hugs to you  Seriously  Life isn't easy  You know how you feel no one else  Take a breath  Study and tests are not the whole world  If you are here talking about it you are open to help  Go to a professional  If you do have an imbalance no amount of talk will fix it entirely  Medicine works and it could change your world  I'm pulling for you and praying as well  Start 2017 off right  go get tuned up   
What are your triggers  And did something specific happen in 7th grade to start it all  Sometimes knowing the root cause reasoning makes it easier to deal with  Once I figured out where mine came from  I found it easier to accept that I had it  and then didn't beat myself up about it so much  
I'm feeling pretty close to what you described there too  It sucks that people close to you aren't taking you seriously  I think it's so irritating when people say that people should have a reason to be depressed  it just doesn't make sense  Like  come on people  it's an illness  Do you need a  reason  to have the flu or something    I hope you start feeling better real soon     and your post didn't seem like a mess to me  
Fuck 2016  You are  not alone man  My 10 year old cat died this  year  I couldn't wait everyday to get home and see her and now she's gone  wtf  
Exactly  
I have this place  a little road divider that I pass on the way to home from work that I always think of speeding up and crashing into  Pass it everyday  but the thoughts still there  My sister died in car crash  Maybe it's tradition   Edit  sorry  I'm fucked up  My point is  the stuff I do makes me care less and less  To the point where I don't care about my well being  Don't care about my body and what I do it or what happens to it  So be careful  
Look into The Gift of Imperfection  Parts of it feel corny but it's got a lot of good writing on how to break out of this cycle  learning to accept yourself  and being content with who you are  I struggled a lot with a lot of constant self deprecating and being too hard on myself and it helped a lot 
Yep  being around negativity really does worsen your mood  That's why I hate the negative circle jerks that sometimes show up  makes me start thinking that way alittle  Maybe try to keep the mood lighter  change subjects

I totally understand this  Anxiety does seem like a huge bully  just like a horrible parrot siting on your shoulder whispering all these negative things and ruining my day  Have you tried any visualisation or meditation or anything to try and get rid of these feelings  Like some people imagine their anxieties as sticks floating down a river  or like waves carrying their anxieties out to sea  Other than that  have you seem your doctor  or a therapist  Do you take any medication 
I laughed the loudest who'd have known  T T
When I was younger I wanted to kill myself   I had my suicide note written and I was ready to go   I kept putting it off because killing yourself actually takes more planning than it seems   Then one day I got a message from a guy that I fell for 4 years before  and I stuck around because he made me smile and made life feel like living for even just a moment    We've been happily together now for nearly 10 years and have a little girl together      There's nothing actually to be gained by dying  but there's a chance to gain something by living   Why would you want to die miserable rather than take the chance to find something worth living for   It all sucks right now  but stay strong and don't deprive yourself of the chance at happiness

For me 2016 was a decent year  depression free for the most part  Except for its last ten days  These ones were painful  disheartening  and they continue being so  Every joy I got during 2016 have suddenly been ripped away from me  leaving me in desperation  The feeling of emptiness and hopelessness came back full on   2013 was the overall worst year of my life  But 2017 has got the worst start thus far 
I suffer from health anxiety  yes  Googling certainly does not help  Have you seen a doctor about this 
It's not just me    Congrats  Maybe I'll work on it this year 
Same 
I don't really have triggers all that much but whenever somebody gets upset at me even in the slightest it normally triggers an inner dialogue with myself that escalates to then point of causing a panic attack  Most of the time though its just a constant feeling of heightened anxiety with spikes throughout the day  I guess in 7th grade is when I realized that my friends weren't the kind of people I liked  they aren't bad people its just I simply stopped liking them  I still am in contact and friendly with them just not friends  I do have a good group of friends now though  The past month though its been taken to a new level because I've been having hallucinations  I think the hardest part of this is growing up I've been constantly told by my mother that shit like depression  anxiety  and adhd are fake and made up so people can get drugs I actually believed that too until pretty recently when I've really started to question everything 
I love dark humor so  i upvote 
My birthday's not in march but besides that I could have made this post  I really think something drastic might happen soon  I can feel myself getting worse and becoming much more comfortable with the idea of suicide
on the bright side you don't really keep in touch with people from highschool when your older    plenty of time to make some weird friends in college and have weird fun stories with 
Blow my nose  lol  and then just lay down and sleep  
Have you tried explaining your anxiety to your friends  And asking them to lay off you a little  Or instead of ignoring them and looking like a pussy  your words  how about just laughing it off  
 removed 
If by non stop you mean everyday or multiple times a day you are more than likely addicted  Benzodiazepines are intended for extremely short term or occasional use  Depending on your dosage and other factors they will cause those types of side effects which in the midst of a panic attack those side effects are totally worth it   Talk to your doctor  maybe see a therapist  A slow titrate off of them including additional anxiety medication and or therapy can help a lot  
Alcohol only works with social stuff and making me laugh a bit more at comedy stuff like it's always sunny if it would make me happy I would be probably be an alcoholic lol 
oh what i'd do to be like you  I feel like everything is and would be awry for me  that my pain would pile up and become unbearable 
there is always  r SuicideWatch too  Lets hope none of us needs any of these services though
I commented in another thread of yours with a recommendation but also wanted to ask if you've tried meditation 
I felt the same way for a really long time   You don't know when things will change  so just keep going   
The mod answered your question perfectly  But I'd just like to say that I'd love to hear some of your writing if you'd like to share  Feel free to inbox me   
Ah  kk   glad to hear it    
Check out rainn org for how to support a friend and some information on laws  Also feel free to share it with your friend  They have a online chat and over the phone hotline  
I will
Same here just waiting to turn 21 and drink myself to death  
Thank you   I will continue the meds and hopefully I'm able to feel better  Happy new  year  
Panic disorder is characterised by sudden intense panic attacks   GAD is characterised by excessive  uncontrollable an often irrational worry  Can be with or without panic attacks   
My SA is mild and I started in a call center on the phones talking to customers but was able to move into workforce analyst and now I work for home full time and rarely talk to anyone on the phone  I only have high school and learned everything on the job  Being able to figure out excel is what really got me ahead  
Sounds like a normal 4 years of high school to me friend  Listen the best advice I can give you is to not give a Eff what others think or say about you and be passionate  Smile  Do that and things will line up and next thing you know your bonkers with a gal who shares your same passion or is drawn to yours  
S2 is when things started to derail  in a good way  I still hope to see dennis go absolutely mental or something haha 
Ah ok   so that explains the whole druggy comment  I'm sorry that your mother says things like that  that definitely is not helpful and untrue    Can you give me an example of the inner dialogue that goes on inside your head  What would be some of the things that you're thinking   I hope you don't mind my questioning  I'm just trying to get a better understanding of what you're going through    
I think it will work because I got reminded of a breakdown where I was telling her my honest feelings and we both cried and I did feel better afterwards  Other times when I keep stuff in  I end up self destructing  So you've enlightened me I think  Happy new year 
Yup  Same boat  No good advice to give  Honestly I feel like I'm not so nice anymore  Too many people left and I gave too much so there's not much left  I wish we as human beings didn't crave connection so much as we do  Life would be easier  
Agent 47 disagrees with your views 
Anything any of us can do  Like reminders or anything 
If she doesnt want to tell her parents  then dont tell her parents  This is about taking control over her life  She might not want to deal with the shame of other people knowing  All I can say is probably just be there for her and do what she asks  
What more can i do  I am forced to keep going  I have to live in misery 
Discord or rabb it are pretty good for virtual hanging out
Wow  that's great   So happy for you   Happy New Year  I don't have any specific resolutions or anything  I worked a lot this year on self care  trying to learn what good habits keep me feeling grounded and okay  learning not to overextend myself when things are going well  I think I'll just keep on with all of that    
New year is hard  Bring around people didn't make it better for me  but it was safer to be around people   It hasn't been fun but it's been diverting  which is what I needed    I love you too and I hope you sleep well after the night is over

2017 used depression   it's super effective  Sorry had to do it  I am sorry you feel that way 
This is very familiar   I hate my job  but I panic on the weekends because the structure is gone   Then I feel worse because I "should" be having a good time on the weekends   I'm trying to impose some structure by going to meetups  Like today I went to a board games meetup in the afternoon  if not for that I probably would have just slept all day   
I read every word  people are listening  people are reading  and we are here  Obviously there isn't much I can do with my lack of intelligence as I am young  but I found that ranting is always a good way to relieve stress  it helps me even in a dark time  So what I'm trying to say is tell your story as often as needed  even if you feel like a hindrance  you aren't  and we are reading  you aren't talking to yourself  I wish you the best through your dark times  Hold on for as long as you can  Apparently from what I heard the grass is actually greener on the other side

Call 911 and please get the care you need since all you will probably have done is fuck up your liver severly if not treated fast  So yeah unless you want to life on a dialisismachine the rest of your life call them they will help you but you have to be fast and don't wait even longer  
I've been at it for hours  sure is wonderful             'sarcasm'
I guess i agree but I also feel like it'd be way easier if people just were a little bit less shitty on the whole  Like if I could just find some cool stable friends or a boyfriend that is sane  i feel like it'd help my depression by preventing it from going soooo crazy  And that's easier than finding solace elsewhere  but maybe I'm just romanticizing  
Yeah I'd easily rank it as the worst year of my life as well  I feel like I won't try to go through the next year
Ive been reading and this seems like the right thing to do  Thank you  at this point id just like to be prepared for in case this gets out and she wants to pursue this legally  Do you know where I can ask for that 
Honestly quitting a job that makes you miserable is a great idea  It's better to find something else first  Makes things less stressful  Things might not be awesome after  but they'll improve marginally if you get out of a toxic environment  
The idea of "love" as we know it today is a by product of romanticism anyway

Holy crap  yes  The holidays have made me emotionally overextended  and super frustrated with myself for being so limited  I missed out on an entire family celebration because the thought of driving to another state was too terrifying  I had to duck out on half of another one because being around all the people  especially the kids  had me crying uncontrollably    And it sucks  and it doesn't make any sense  I'm supposed to be able to trust that my family and friends won't hurt me  I'm supposed to enjoy spending time with them  And I try  And I know I'm very lucky to have a family that is mostly decent  But I just get overstimulated so easily     
Living in misery with the chance of being happy   I wish you well
Did you write a note 
 removed 
I go home to my family's place every Christmas New Year's  A whole bunch of my extended family shows up  aka 20  people in one house    They stopped asking if I had a boyfriend about 5  years ago  They also stopped asking if I have had crushes recently  Or if I was looking for a boyfriend   Basically  there's an unspoken consensus that I'm a spinster  Or will be a spinster    In a way  I'm glad they don't say anything  because it hurts enough to know it  
You can try looking at r latestagecapitalism  I believe they have some reading material in their sidebar  
what did you do 
Adding to this I also doubt you have seen the best places this earth to offer  go travel and combine it with trying out local cuisine and trying food so you can find the best tasting meal on the planet    Maybe you are interested in photography  Take a camera with you  or drawing  Get some supplies and sit in the nature while you draw paint your surroundings   Like camping  Get a tent and stuff  get out and see the world  As crazy how it sounds what is there to lose you may have to save for a bit or have a some debt but it can be a great chance to find a renewed taste for life    I do reccomend using something like airnb for places to stay since hotels can get pretty damm expensive 
Maybe  I mean  I don't really think so  It's that life is inherently  without meaning  but it's possible to give it meaning  Even if it's not much  I can do something no matter how small the impact  
I appreciate the questioning its helps me to talk about things a lot  The inner dialogue is pretty much just me reminding myself that I'm a burden and trying to get myself to calm down but that makes it worse and I always tell myself I have two more years of this and then I can leave it all behind but everytime I see that I don't think I can handle two more years 
Well that's one fear I hope you never conquer  my friend  
Good job 
Thank you for sharing  It's not always as easy as it may sound
Med compliance for BP is super important in general  but even more so with lamictal   Messing around with its dosage and starting stopping is a way to increase the chances of the serious rash side effect   Lamictal is a wonder drug for a lot of people  but believe me   you don't want any part of that rash   Be careful 
"I really have a lot of love to give but it feels like the universe doesn't want me " Yep  well said  Wanting it badly that it hurts  No good advice also  but I'll just second to what you said  We all want to be loved also not just one way   
Good luck with your therapist visit  
Not OP but I've tried both agmatine and sarcosine for that lingering anhedonia  I didn't get much from either  but I don't think I gave them a proper trial  Would you mind sharing your protocol for agmatine 
Happy New Year 
Sometimes being with people who make you feel alone is just as bad as being alone

Ah so is living with your mother what's causing this  
Yeah I relate I feel like i'm living my life for media right now like it's the primary reason for living   but hey it keeps me going    gotta see what's next on the flash or how kingdom hearts will end or what the next elderscrolls will be like  Also let's hope the next justice league will be good I want to see how this gritty version turns out 
Well the question would be what do I have left   And the answer is not much  I recently got a cat so I can't kill myself but that's the only good thing I can see  
Your girlfriend is wrong  That is definitely sexual assault  and you have every right to feel however you feel about it  I'm so sorry that it happened to you      I'm glad that you reached out  and went outside of your normal support network when it failed you  There are other resources as well   like rainn  that can be super helpful for figuring out how to respond  and at the very least dealing with the emotional aftermath  Talking to someone who believes you and understands can be immensely helpful  You deserve to be listened to  
That's existentialism 
Works wonders for me  That being said  just 2 3 of a pill of the lowest dose knocks me cold in 30 min no problem 
Dude I was asleep alone in my room at 11 35 pm  Feels bad when I woke up 6 hours later

Fuck man I dunno what to say but your post is really calling to me for some reason    I guess just know it's completely your decision  Nobody can stop you but everyone wants to  In the end it's all on you  Hope you make it through the night man  Just know there's love comin from somewhere 
To live a stable life and to be happy 
jesus man  I always kinda knew that is was my family and shit but like  it just hit me hella hard  I know what I need and I've known for a long time but fuck its hard to have to wait two years to get it
Are there any other family members you could stay with  Or any local charities agencies that may help you moving away from your parents if they're causing you to be this unhappy anxious  
I'm really sorry you feel so down  I don't know what drove you to such hopelessness that you believe life is not worth living  However  help is out there if you seek it out   even though it may be difficult to reach out to someone when you feel alone  People care about you and tough times in life are easier to get through if you have someone to let you know that you're ok  Anyway  please update so we know you're ok    
Thanks for your reply    It isn't getting easier  and now I have to bottle it in because I just keep getting yelled at or abused if I say something to anybody    I have been doing everything in my power to get some money so I am not on the street in a few days time  I have not been eating or anything    I was never  ever like this I am so confused  every morning I just wake up in a daze because this is absolutely f   ed  I was just cut off so instantly   I keep having panic attacks every night  they are annoying  I am doing everything in my power so that I can remain happy but nothing is working and everything reminds me of my job   This is truly the worst I have been  whenever I fell down like this before I was able to pick myself up again    There has to be something wrong with me if this keeps happening right   I feel like I am dealing with this on my own  which I am and I really hate doing it I hate having to be miserable all the time   I have looked into all options and my best bet now is to work but for cash and I have to save but I just need the money to come in on the asap so I can get to a new place    I am panicking as I type    dude I have never been in a worse place than I was on that day and they changed me for the worst I cant even smile because theres nothing to be happy about i look like a stone    ah theres no point in explaining    i just dwell in circles until the next panic attack strike   i really would like this to end and be over
Funny  I want to die bc of my parents
agreed  
Not panic attack but anxiety and abnormal agitation about things average people don't even care about  I'm not thinking about problems for hours to take myself into panic  but it comes by itself  I don't even realize sometimes that my body is in panic mode and my speaking starts to stutter    It can lead to the feeling you are in a prison in your own body which is not good but you are definitely not alone  should be easier to cure than mental problems 
I find that chasing the workout high helped  So every sweat sesh came with its own incentive   
Glad there is someone here for me 
Yes 
I never thought I would die alone 
Not so good   my friends totally blew me off so I ended up getting drunk and watching TV with my immediate family  Could be worse though I suppose 
If you're able  try replacing the cutting with a fuck ton of push ups  Those things hurt like a bitch  even when starting out with a small number   And it helps tone the body slightly when you get that urge to cut  I did that for a while  doesn't work for everyone  however

Hey just listen  Don't get carried away   
If when you get a chance ask your psychiatrist directly  it's best to get this information from the horse's mouth  so to speak 
thank you  I'm going to talk to my doctor when I go get some their stuff checked out    
I just got out of the psychiatric hospital yesterday   2016 was my worst year ever  and I realize I have a two year cycle but fuck  Thank you for the well wishes and I am optimistic this year will get better  it has to be better than the last  right   I'm going to be 41 and finally diagnosed as manic depressive disorder with anxiety that I will have the rest of my life  One of my goals was to reach out to people more and participating in this sub  Seems fitting  I'm trying to not climb back into my hole where I couldn't even leave the bed   
why does "depression" have it's own subreddit  that is literally the saddest thing ever    I guess it doesn't matter anyways    BTW  I'm joking  
I wish I could do that but I know I can't  Family is out of my options because I don't want to put that unfair pressure on them  I can't make a scene out of this its just not who or how I am  I guess I'm just fucked unless I can get a psychiatrist who knows how to help  Thank you for the help man  I'm just gonna have to pull through for two more years  It just sucks that my mother constantly guilts me for wanting to move away as soon as I'm 18 and done with highschool  My brother is 19 and still here and they have a relationship so I guess that cool  I feel like an ass for leaving but I know shes only trying to guilt me into not leaving to make herself feel better and to make sure she has control over me  Thats the thing with her  control  She digs through my meds and questions me about everything  Didn't take my entire bottle of Buspar once because it was break and I was only ever awake for one dose and she flipped shit on me for lying to her and being such a piece of shit whos manipulating her and then started to wake me up at 2 A M just to force me to swallow a pill that I'll had to take again the second I woke up again on my own  
A subreddit for depressed people should be their moto xd
I was the driver with a passenger  I didn't even feel fear for him while this was happening   something I'm not used to   Normally I care way more about other people than myself  
Month ago I told myself I would jump off the bridge on the 31st  Fucking ass nugget I'm still here 
As someone whos been single his whole life  I feel ya  Got to watch my co worker who I've had a crush on have a NYE kiss with another co worker who I guess shes been talking too  Life sucks most of the time  but there are those few brief moments of happiness that make the bad times tolerable  So  look forward to more of those good times this year and be happy to say "Hey  I survived another year "  I'm terrible with stuff like this  I hope it helps you in some way 
Well  I did it  She said she is interested in being friends  but she'll tell me if that changes to more  At least she was straight forward  I feel like eventually the weight will be lifted from my shoulders  but all I want to do right now is cry myself to sleep 
OP  to answer your question  First  I have had MDD for ten years now  Second  I do the same thing  I see something shitty about to happen and all I can think is "oh boy  here it comes" and when it happens I'm like "See  told ya "  I read an article that people with depression are better in high stress situations because they can cope better with the reality of the outcome which may and can be bad  So you're not crazy  but you might be depressed 
I was too tired at the time I posted that comment and I did the maths in a wrong way 
Aww  Thanks again so much  Feel free to message me anytime

Thank you  I'll take you up on your suggestion and check out rainn  However I think I have to have a long talk with my s o tomorrow about where to go from here  I appreciate the response at such a late hour  
Ah well for sure I have depression then   my whole life has been shitty medical events for the past couple years   I won't go into detail but every time something shitty happens I just accept it xd  The part of me that makes me think I dont have depression is my ability to move on  Generally I don't linger on shitty parts of life  I just go forwards and escape into things I like  This black and white diagnosis is pretty retarded  Life is almost never you either have it or you don't  Everyone I know who has extreme depression will linger on terrible events for months at a time  I just sorta move on   like my life is a video game or something 
Do you know how long the wait is 
Hang in there  I know that sounds cliche but seriously
you got some Internet buds here  have a happy new year  
No matter  I hate brushing my fucking teeth and do it like once a month  and have since I was a child  Ever since this asshole dentist  he nearly killed my ass when I was 10 or so  I then been afraid of going to the dentist and as I grew up I eventually got over it   I'm 26 and black and gay  All my front teeth are rotted  I'm saving up for full mouth extractions dentures veneers with no anesthesia one day lol    I don't have bad breath though shockingly    When you don't have that many friends or family or no lover  Why the fuck should you care about your teeth 
I'm facing a similar problem to you  I just isolated myself and pushed everyone away  The reason wasn't simple  but I  did it because I thought everyone close to me didn't care about me at all but for themselves only  I still have time to think about it since I'm only 16 but I think in your case  you can always make amends with your old friends and make new ones who genuinely care about you  That's always an option        
Yea I think you're right  You're really good at reading into things  o  Whether or not my lack of emotion is a good or bad thing is something for me to decide I guess    
Well it sounds like you may have a low setting of depression  you gotta level up son  If you still care to wash your ass and do shit you like you got noob level depression  People with legit depression don't even get out of bed for days  Don't clean themselves  don't do a damn thing except eat and wallow in their misery 
What happened 
My crush didnt invite me to a party
Would there truly be a huge difference if you didnt have SA  Some people are just inherently introverted by nature and seek to avoid people as much as they can get away with   I'm one of those select few so my severe SA doesen't bother me too much 
Does she know you like her  and even then this isn't the end of the world bro you'll find someone eventually  I believe in you
Things that are easy aren't worth anything  P sure their life night be easy but there's a reason people who have everything handed to them are unhappy    your health was taken from you  when you get it back it will mean much more to you than it does to a person who's never had it taken away
There's probably some reason why this grossly unsafe or whatever  but what the heck  my Facebook is a public profile and most people can see most things on it  It's not exactly secret   This is me a couple of weeks ago  overcoming OCD agoraphobia issues by going out to a café for a nice slice of cake  Six months ago I was pretty much housebound and couldn't make it past my front door without a panic attack  so it's nice to recover enough to relax a mile away from my house  for an hour  in a busy café   https   www facebook com photo php fbid 10100115742934261 set a 548184129681 68090 223001922 type 3 theater
What happened was sexual assault  and it was not your fault  You have every right to be upset and how you're feeling is totally understandable    I'm sorry your girlfriend and other friends reacted so poorly  I saw in another response that you intend to talk to your girlfriend tomorrow  If that conversation doesn't go well  it may indicate that this relationship could impede your recovery and may need to end    I know it's hard to reach out to other people after being dismissed by people you thought you could trust  but if you have any friends or family you could maybe talk to or lean on that could be helpful  You don't have to even tell them what happened if you don't want to  You could just tell them something happened that upset you and you could use a little extra love and support right now    RAINN is a great resource  Some other resources for men include  1in6 org  survivorsuk  based in the U K   and livingwell  based in Australia     You aren't alone  Take care of yourself  
Hah  I wish my new years resolutions were as ''easy'' as this one   ' 
"Deep in earth my love is lying  and I must weep alone " 
Meant alone  Not saline in the title 
Yes she does and she only see's me as a friend  I can't handle it  I want to end my life
I'm afraid this year won't be better just by hoping that it will  Time to start making small changes and the big changes will come    happy new year and all the best for the future 
Hey don't kill yourself over such a small matter you'll have time to talk and you'll have time to talk about your feelings it just takes time you just have to be patient
I can't t tell you how much that resonates with me  What happened to my emotions they're missing  
I was so  mentally  close to ending it late November  but decided to spend one last holiday season with my family  Holiday festivities may be one of the few things that brings me happiness anymore  My family actually gets along during Christmas time  I wanted to stay around for one last Christmas so it wouldn't ruin future holidays for them if I ended it during the season  Now that it's 2017 I no longer want to kil myself  I am still morbidly depressed and especially sad to say goodbye to my family's rare cheery demeanor  But I can't end it  I just can't

I don't know  but it seems that the more you love yourself the more people around you tend to notice  I've never had a relationship  but that's alright  maybe it's not my time and perhaps I need to better myself before someone will like me   To anyone reading this  having depression is like being a diamond in the rough  Being depressed is horrible  it really is  but it gives you a unique perspective on life  If you can power through this you'll become one of the most beautiful people in the world   I love all you guys  I wish I could make you feel complete  but that's something you have to do yourself  Make 2017 the year you refine your character  I believe in all of you 
I know it's hard to be left by someone important to us especially if we are depressed or sad most of the time or just going through a rough patch  But it is also essential that we focus on ourselves and find what makes us happy or entertained even for a while  Try to talk and go out with a friend or a family member and just talk to them about it   or not  Or you could even find new friends  I hope that all will be well for you OP  Don't lose hope  
It's gonna be a year of major change  dude  Hang in there  this is gonna be one wild motherfucking roller coaster of a ride  And I'm ready 
Me too 
Last year I decided that I needed to join some kind of fitness group so that I can force myself to be around others and hopefully make friends  I decided to join Crossfit and it has made such a positive change to my life  I am still socially anxious and don't get out much but CF has given me a reason to get out of the house  I've gotten over my eating disorder  I've gained confidence  I've gained strength  and I have actually made some friends   I tried things like netball and athletics clubs but I stopped going after about a month  The CF community is second to none   the environment is so encouraging  I would highly recommend you trying it   I am so much happier in myself purely because of CF  
Thank you for your kind words  I hope so too   
Good bye  I hope you got some pleasure from this fucked up world 
sigh   
yeah the cycle is quite frustrating  thank you though    
Hell is individual to each person  you can disagree all you want but you can't deny that in OP's world he probably is in hell 
You're an amazing person  I'm glad you're doing well 
the primary reason to care for teeth for most of us is to avoid having them extracted  dental pain can be excruciating and having them taken out is also crazy painful  and super expensive if you have to have them surgically removed as some people do  you go through a checkup every six months to a year to avoid having to spend thousands on a dentist yanking your teeth out  
Can I just trade body with any female no matter which skin color or orientation   Have you seen Sense8  It's on Netflix  Pretty good and also about different people with other perspectives 
I believe you can do it  I want you to have a good year and if you need support through the rough times  hit me up through reddit  Your brother in humanity is all that I am 
Yeah and the worst part is your suck in this body for life  This is all you got in this world  There's no choosing  it is what it is unfortunately 
I know  I'm black and gay too and so depressed about it  I'm scared my life is going to end very soon in an ugly fashion and I'll never find love    I don't know if you're christian or not  but I pray to god that my life will be better someday and it gives me hope   I'm not gonna recommend you watch some hollywood pop culture shit either   
Thanks  this was a pretty nice thing to wake up too  I've been pretty good lately about just focusing on today and doing whatever I can to make me happy but people in my life  family  often ask like what's my plan or whatever and think I'm just burying my head in the stand but I don't think they understand if I focus on it for too long I convince myself I'm going to get trapped here and stuck in this minimum wage loop and I can't get stuck here  I won't  I'm not really one to cave under social expectation to do something so most of the time I don't really care that I'm a Virgin but idk I get lonely sometimes   Somedays I just stop seeing the point  were all going to keep trying but for what cause  Were choosing to live in pain with no promise of it going away  Then I'll wake up the next day in a positive mood  I still agree with everything I thought the day before but i don't obsess over it  I've never told any of my friends the way I feel I usually just make up some dumb excuse for not going out or doing anything  part of me misses them but the other part really doesn't  and just wants to be alone
I really really related to this post  My depression started in college  like you I consider myself attractive and funny  Attracting people isn't hard  it's the keeping them because of the mental illness we have  I hear what you are saying  I hear you when you say even professionals don't understand  All I can say is it DOES get better  Take baby steps  you don't have to conquer your life in a day  a week or a year  Do ONE thing a day  That can be anything  Wash the glasses  pick clothes off the floor  just ONE thing  I wish I had better advice  people on this sub have really good things to say  Just know that people read what you wrote and we get it  Really get it  You aren't alone  
There's no reason for any of this  I don't get why we are even alive wtf is this shit  It's all about how much you can personally take before giving in to the endless dark void of mystery  I'm right on the  cusp right now 
I totally get it man I'm in that same place  I can't decide if I want to continue on in this weird world or not 
I get the same thing sometimes  Don't feel embarrassed  i'm sure they will understand what you were going through   
I'm sorry man  I am in a similar boat  I've just realized you can't pick who you are in this world and whatever you get is what your stuck with  Either you learn to accept yourself or give in and end it all  
Shit man  we can talk 
I worked at a restaurant for the past 4 years  most restaurants have the hostess or someone else wipe down the menus when it's "slow"  It passes time and is efficient  I've noticed it in other restaurants when it's slow they normally have a bottle near their stand and wipe those things down  This is hopefully the standard for all restaurants but some bosses employers are different  I also always washed my hands like so much during a shift  I always felt all gross and germy  Happy New Years   hope you find strength and guidance in 2017 
I've had depression since I was about 15  I'm early 30's now  I try so so hard to not be depressed  I clean my house  go workout  walk my dog  but it's there all the time  When they call it he black dog that follows you around I get it  that's exactly what it's like  I go through the motions but get mostly no joy out of anything  I don't remember being excited  I'm scared of everything and hate  although I do it  leaving the house  I don't understand people who WANT to do things and meet up with people  I want to sleep forever 
It hurts so much she post snapchats off herself at a house party  I can't fucking take it  
I read the whole thing and I'm in a similar boat  
same  i need to as well
You just have to be strong these things come and go
 r notababyimatumor   well done   How awesome does it feel to have reached that goal        r frashmastergland   I wish I knew  It definitely is something that is a common in depressed people    It is an area that I have to actively focus on making sure I do  Having found a really good dentist has made it so much easier because I no longer have an excruciating time at the dentist  Maybe it's dental technology that has changed  maybe it's attitudes that have changed  But oh my gawd   finally finding a dentist who can do a simple scale and clean for me without needles  Life changing  So it's this little bit of motivation that helps keep me on track in this area  Now if only I could find the motivations to keep me on track in other areas   
It's tough  waking up to be forced into festivities  but you're right the people who need the wishes are actually those who are struggling the most  Change is constant  and yes sometimes we can't see it and everything looks bleak and dark  I'm guilty of this as well   But one way or another it has to end  I hope this year is easier than the last for all of you 
Yep  Fuck ugliness 
Hey 17 here too  in the same boat as you  I think a good first step would be to potentially be kinder with yourself  that's one of my goals   Don't worry about resolutions and all  because improvement is constant     At 17 we lack the overview that comes with age  and it often feels like our actions are a lot more severe  The way you feel will change  and you don't need to make huge steps every day  some days you won't make progress  but on average eventually there will be improvement  I know at this stage in life everything feels so crucial  but I'm sure there are many people like us  who have gone through this same situation and managed to turn out well    
My birthdays in March too  want to talk about anything 
at 12 00 i was with all ym friends and they told me they were all goinghome after hanging and at 2 00 they were all at some party wihtout me     i felt so horrible
You'll find it  
Yup I hate touching all these things  But I carry around a little bottle of hand sanitizer  so I can touch them if I need to and just disinfect my hands afterwards   Honestly  it's hard for me to internalize that it's irrational to not want to touch these things  or to disinfect my hands after touching them   because these things ARE objectively dirty  they've been handled by so many random people  some of whom are sick  or who use the bathroom without washing their hands   and I've worked in enough service industry jobs to know this stuff rarely or never gets cleaned 
I've been dealing with this type of thing for a few weeks now  my stomach just hasn't felt right lately and of course my anxiety likes to exploit that  I've been trying to take steps in the right direction and keep telling myself that I've been extremely anxious with everything and anything involving my health in the last few months and that this upset stomach is just being caused by anxiety  I don't think I have any reason to suspect anything serious  and again i just try my hardest to tell myself that my health anxiety has probably just made me more aware of what are probably normal bodily functions with the anxiety making more unsettled then normal  But it's tough you know  Things such as stomach cancer are scaring me and has given me my first panic attack in a while  I was honestly doing so well with the panic attacks before today  Ulcers also crossed my mind  Every sensation i fell in my stomach sends me into an anxious state  I've even started confusing hunger pains with reasons to worry  my appetite hasn't been the best lately  But I'll continue to try make myself believe its my anxiety until i have reason for concern  Unfortunately  anxiety is winning by a landslide  
2016 was the worst for me too  but cmon bro    2017 will be great  Everyone can do it  so can we 
I tend not to post on the younger folks' threads  as I am sure my negativity likely won't help them out much  People like to say that things get better  but that's really not how life works  you know  Chances are  the thoughts spiral downwards until you are forced to put up walls to protect yourself from the pain and nagging thoughts  And through this  you become more jaded  more cynical  more empty as your walls begin to suffocate you in the truth of your hollow existence  You tell yourself you put up those walls to protect you from those outside influences  but in all honesty  you are protecting the people around you from you  from your scathing anger  loathing  and negativity   Just food for thought from a mid 30's fellow 
You're very welcome  In my experience you rarely know whether or not you're suffering unnecessarily until you've stopped suffering  Good luck and feel better soon 
Maybe this year  you  will  be 
  lower   Thanks  Nice to hear someone else's opinion on the matter  Lately I've felt a little bit better  but it still kicks in at times  and makes some of my days just depressing and sad  It's kind of funny actually  how life either is on top or the very bottom of the bowel  But I want to say thanks again  it felt great actually being able to speak out to someone about it

I wanted to go to sleep too but then all the fireworks and noise   
It's different for everyone  I've found that different combinations worked at different stages  The first med I tried was Zoloft which worked brilliantly until it didn't    I've also tried lexapro  Wellbutrin  agomelatine  also known as valdoxan   abilify  and probably more that I can't remember  all at different times   I came back to Zoloft after about a 10 year break and it's working very well    My advice to you is keep an open mind and be very honest about your side effects and symptoms   I wish you the best  
And fuck the world that makes people with brains like ours need to feel lonely and isolated  The world can and should do better by us
No problem  they just do that to be huge trolls but don't necessarily understand the consequences sometimes  I hope you have a great new year 
Oh well  this is hard i know  but you have to take a detour  First of all you have to find at least a few things you just like and enjoy  cultivate them to the point where they can make you feel okay  After that you branch seek for new things in same or similar categories  untill you find something that can be used during a party 
Hey  Unfriend her and just focus on yourself  It will hurt less one day  trust me  
Wow    This really isn't the place to be a troll  Move onto another subreddit  please 
I'm so confused  Anyway  happy new year  Your message was really nice  made me smile   wishing you all the best  3
 Who do I blame  Is it my fault  I can't help but feel like I failed  Does never tragedy come uncalled  Sometimes  including this time  horrible shit just happens  I don't want you to hurt yourself worse by thinking this is somehow your fault  A million small realities came together to make your reality  which is shitty right now  and I'm sorry    I have no reason to believe that I'm worth anything   You're worth a lot  What would you say if you saw a stranger saying these things  I think you might say something like "of course you're worth something  everyone is " And it's true  On top of that  I'm deeply touched by the amount of energy you've put into how to best support your family and friends  considering you have so little energy yourself  That's huge    That's not failure    If I could  I would give you a standing ovation right now   I unfortunately have been somewhere similar to how you feel  and it's really hard  You're not alone  I can see how hard you've been fighting and it's amazing  I hope you can see yourself the way I see you 
That's awesome  As someone who also struggles with mundane tasks due to depression  I commend you for making good on your goal 
I would message the mods  At least one of them has been trained to work a suicide hotline which is desperately needed  I'm so glad to hear you're doing better    
i don't mean to be that guy but just so you know  it's  u  for users and  r  for subreddits  you're awesome  happy new year 
Just saw this   Just my two cents about the creative outlet   It can hard to verbalize feelings sometimes  That being said  Talk therapy helps a lot  Therapists are professionally trained to guide you  and they'll work with your personal needs    Let me know if you have any questions with it  I've been in and out of talk therapy for 80  of my life 
great idea
You're not worthless  It's really hard for depressed people  or anyone with a lot of baggage  to reach out and make a strong  clear connection with others  and I'm so sorry  This is a lot for you to go through  But it's not because you're worthless  I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that if you're young  it's because everyone around you is sorting out their own baggage  It's amazing to me how much kinder and gentler the world has gotten every year since leaving HS 
Please do everyone a favor and bring all of your pets to a no kill shelter  they deserve better than you 
Oh I'm glad to read that  you too 
I didn't get any either  but I didn't send any    so I don't think I deserve to be upset about it  I plan to make 2017 about myself and my girlfriend and we are going to build our lives up by only focusing on the positive people in our lives   Cheers to 2017  keep your chin up 
hello   your anxiety and concerns are definitely worth mentioning to the relevant person at your uni  this could be an academic registrar  welfare supervisor  accommodation manager or whatever the university has  so that they can bare your needs in mind when allocating rooms  They might not necessarily be able to guarantee anything  but they have a duty of care to students and given that it's still so early in the process there should be plenty of flexibility  like universities have to house people they accept in clearing and that doesn't happen until after a level results day   Also get in touch with your student union  again their quality reaaaaalllllyy varies from uni to uni but they will be able to give you really specific advice about what provisions your particular uni has    And finally when you get to uni I promise you'll be absolutely fine   it is super daunting for everyone and everyone feels at least a bit of anxiety at some point  You'll be amazed at how quickly you adapt to everything and the how strong your new friendships will be  Also don't forget that you definitely are not alone whilst you're studying   universities all have incredible networks of counselling services  welfare structures etc etc that will be wayyyyy beyond anything you had at school  I did loads of research about all this before I went away for first time  almost 3 years ago now omg  and I found it really reassuring to know exactly who I could turn to no matter what my problem was    That turned into a bit of a random waffle but I hope it helped   basically uni has the potential to be literally life changing in the most positive of ways if you approach it with the right information and mindset        
Engaging in other OCD rituals  doing heroin  ingesting copious amounts of sedatives  and dropping heavy objects on one's head all have similar effects    It's useful to keep the focus on actions  not relieving feelings or thoughts  Trying to avoid those feelings thoughts is what OCD is all about  If you take drugs so you don't feel distressed  that can lead to practicing OCD even more because you don't see feel a problem    It doesn't sound like you're connecting the shots of alcohol with the OCD attack  Do you see them as helping you get out of it  Not causing it  If somebody said that their door checking ritual doesn't make them anxious in the morning  it helps them calm down  what would you think about that   If somebody got an injury while running in a race and then chugged a few shots of whisky and gotback in the race  Maybe they wouldn't feel the pain from the injury anymore  But they're doing the same thing that caused the injury  Whether they feel it or not is irrelevant  they're making it worse  They'll experience even more pain later   
I hate when I am having thoughts like these  and I have even acted on a few of them  What I did to help reduce the risk of hurting myself is adopt emergency measures  such as ice cream or my favorite tv show  
In one sense  maybe your friend chose to try to include you and remember you even though they were out with other friends     But I understand how it can sting  My girl's best friend was in town and wanted her us to come out but we are broke  and I'm kind of afraid of going out to the crowded nightlife places on Saturday nights  let alone NYE  So it wouldn't have been a very good time anyway 
I'm sorry to hear that  I honestly don't remember the last time I had a "good year"   But then  I haven't had "bad" years either  I've just been numb for so long that I barely even remember the years   It's like I'm standing in a movie scene where everyone around me is moving super fast and i'm standing still in the center  and somehow no one notices the person stuck in the same spot for 20whatever years 
Thanks  I was looking at the anatomy of the brain to find the part of my head I should shoot before finding this place 
I think it's more the idea of this person  It could as well be someone physically different  But it's the image or the idea you had of her  At least in my case    Turns out this person was just another one who uses people probably without even knowing it  The kind who works by interest and wants some attention when the SO isn't here  Basically those who are not honest but probably don't do it intentionally  if you know what I mean

How do I return it 
I would do the swimming again  When it comes to working out its best to do something you enjoy since you're more likely to stick with it  You can do it  You just have to force yourself to do it  Cause the self you are right now isn't never going have a day where you feel good enough to make new good habits  You have to force them to happen cause then in the journey you'll begin to feel better  
If it really helps you should try the oil in the long term not sure about the dose and     doesn't damage your lungs and brain not sure about the 2  one 
I developed mine  Growing up I was very out spoken  Then a series of traumatic things happened that made me take a back seat to my life  I had my SA ever since 8th grade  
I couldn't even finish the half college cause of it and got disqusted by the jobs decent ones  with better salary than average jobs with diploma eastern EU   in a couple months  you got nothing to lose if you try  but if it's really bad then you need some kind of help 
I'm with you  I'm not doing 30  I'm done 
You took a small step  Keep taking those small steps and you will work your way out of this  I was were you are a few years ago  Got so worked up about posting online  I even found it hard to play online games as my  heart would start racing as I joined the game    It gets better 100  as long as you keep taking small steps   Happy New Year 
I wish wouldn't be to scared to kill myself  Today I woke up and just thought "Why I am fucking alive  Why didn't I finally just kill myself  It's only getting worse and worse  etc "      But I don't wanna hurt my parents and my best friend  she visited a few friends and I didn't want to destroy her day with being all sad    And I'm still here  writing this shit  living this supid life  I'm so busy with not killing myself that I don't have any energy left to improve my life  I could do so much more  but I just    can't    Whatever  whatever  I hope you have a great 2017  D
That's great  Do you have a dentist  It's pretty great to keep up your teeth hygiene and have the dentist commend you on a good job as well  It's a great feeling when a professional tells you you're doing good so you know you're at least doing it right   I struggle with brushing daily myself  Sometimes i go a week without washing my mouth at all  The depression can be SO crippling on the simplest things in life   I have been trying to make it work by increasing the time spent in the bathroom when you wake up  98 3  of the time  you need to take a piss  You're already in the bathroom  don't leave until you brush  Brush as you pee  even   I often sit during my morning piss so I can do all that  plus a little Redditing and check my email quick   Anyway I totally get the struggle and I'm proud of you

Good on you for recognising who is at fault in this situation  I grew up in a similar environment and was brainwashed to believe it was my fault  It was very liberating to realise that the adults in my life had choices and were supposed to protect me  
I am all of those

There's no competition for me  I've already lost 
You are going through a tough time  I was there for 5 years  I sometimes look back and think 'what did I do for 5 years ' I barely functioned  lost a lot because of it  How did I get on the road to recovery  This is going to sound annoyingly simple but I just forced myself to 'do it ' I saw my choices as either remain a prisoner to SA and live a miserable life or face my fears and get back out there and make something happen  It really is that simple  It involves feeling uncomfortable  facing situations that brought about fear but the alternative  living in fear and avoiding everything  is much more scary to me   Two things that really helped me were mindfulness meditation and exercise  The meditation helped to calm all the harmful thoughts I had about myself and the exercise burned off adrenalin and cortisol and made me feel calmer    The only thing to do is put on your running shoes and workout  Do it today  What is the alternative  I guarantee after you work out you will feel 100 times better than if you avoid it for another day   Go on  Get it done   Edit for clarity  I still battle SA everyday and I still have bad days  I don't want OP to think I am saying it's easy  I know how hard it can feel sometimes  But no one can change it for you  You are in the driving seat  You can change  You will change 
Everyone on here is dealing with anxiety  and thus  it's probably safe to assume that the people who reply do too  I know I've deleted mine in the past because I felt I exposed too much of myself  and despite that I might be helping someone  some "evil doer" might use my words against me

the thing that worries me about that is that you don't just "get put on a different mood stabilizer"  that's a whole  thing  where you try something for two weeks  work up to a dose  try that for another two weeks  spend another two weeks moderating the mood  and then if it doesn't work you start the whole month two month cycle over    should i really worry that much about the lack of blood work if i'm taking a lower dose of a med that i've been stable on for years  
It's not like they really mean it  I mean some literally type one standard message and send it to everyone  I literally got one single message from a guy I haven't seen in 4 years and forgot he even existed  
Grad school is hard  Anxiety can make grad school much  much harder  Being forced to drop out because you can't take it anymore can be devastating  Make sure you have a strong network of support 
Why  You started by saying a hot chick was interested in you  and ended with that  What happened to make you feel that way 
Thank you  Honestly very reassuring to hear  I've got a few friends with various mental health issues so I've learned a thing or two about how to not completely suck  but I still feel a little lost sometimes 
What a weird game it is huh  Thanks again   
HUGS  Its okay  we got your back 
Be glad that you still have goals and dreams  Follow them 
Hi  I'm new on this subreddit and yours is one of the first I've read  I have to say  if your therapist doesn't take you seriously  find another  An aspect of depression is that little things have a huge affect  I've been dealing with depression now for several decades  on and off  and have been on sick leave since last May because of depression and anxiety  What you're describing are pretty typical indications  especially the losing interest in hobbies and such   My therapist tells me that I need to do those things regardless of whether I "want to" or not  doing them will slowly rekindle the interest and the joy that they bring  Hang in there  And find a therapist that takes you seriously 
Mine developed for sure  Was about the most outgoing confident guy you could meet  In my early 30s I made some bad decisions  went through a traumatic experience and got myself stuck in a situation that was the final straw  I went from outgoing to paralysed with fear and doubts and couldn't even face my family   For me looking back a lot boiled down to how I felt about what I was doing with my life  When things fell apart career wise my confidence fell through the floor and things spiralled

I tried scripting to see if I could figure out how scripters think and see if I could learn how to beat them  It made the game a lot less stressful when all you do is press spacebar or c and v  You lose sense of the toxicity in the game  but it  also killed my dream of playing League competitively  I realized how dreadful of a player I was without scripts so I quit 
At least you can still cry  I've been alone for so long I'm longing for it    not the loneliness tho  Paradox I know 
That's awesome man  That and a daily shower help so much  Invest time in yourself  You're worth it 
I don't know that this is really an anxiety probably or more of a nervousness shyness  Have you thought about maybe texting him  it writing him a letter  or something like that 
it's an on and off type of thing  sometimes i dont do it becasuse i feel like i dont deserve it
Just because it's a new year doesn't mean things automatically change  it doesn't mean your problems magically go away  it's literally just the start of a new calendar year  it's just a new day  just as any other day is   Have you thought about seeking counselling to get things if your chest  rather than bottling them up

I made it onto the freeways today  Fighting with a long driving phobia I've slowly made it crawling to be able to drive around normal areas  that was hard but i've always avoided the freeways  Today I made it out onto them  I did 1 exit like 10 times  it was hard  I feel exhausted  but I hope it just gets easier from here 
They will understand when they're older  I think this sub skews more towards the teenage end of the spectrum  I don't even know why I sub here as a mid 30's guy  I have nothing in common with people here  Really  it often makes me feel more alone because I can't give a shit about video games 99  of the time 
I'm not sure either  but since I have anxiety  diagnosed by a psychiatrist  not by me of course   I figured it also played a role  Maybe also what we call anxiety in french isn't exactly the same as in english   I've thought about this  but I feel like if I can't tell him face to face it's not right I don't deserve it  idk hard to explain and it might seem stupid  Anyways I just wanted to vent that out  thanks for the answer 
If I'm busy when I'm drunk I'm good  Even symptom free  But once I'm alone like when I got home last night I was a mess  It almost seemed to double because I was drunk  I wanted to be sober really bad but obviously that isn't how it works lol    I normally end up focusing on my breathing then start to freak myself out  Then my symptoms increase a lot when I start panicking  Overall using drugs to mask OCD works personally but often makes things worse the next day for me  or after the party  
I've been thinking a lot about loneliness for a while now  I think I worded quite well in a recent comment too      One thing I believe we all have in common is a sense of aloneness  Whether this manifests itself as loneliness in everyone  I'm not sure  But the way we see and deal with ourselves is different to the way we see and deal with others  and the way we see other people see and deal with each other    I experience the world only through my own eyes  I can only think with my own mind  When I pee  or get out of bed  it's only me doing it  Nobody else  Feeling sore or tired is only done myself  I can't feel your pain    When I talk to someone it is a fundamentally different experience than when I see someone talk to someone else  For example  I might talk to Steve and Paul  When I talk to Steve or Paul  it's me talking to the "other"  someone separate from myself  There is an element of aloneness present in that  I can't see what they thinking the way I can see what I am thinking    When I see Steve and Paul talking however  it's different  It's now two "others" talking  It's different from when I talk to Steve or Paul  It's more connected  It's more connected because they're the same in my experiences  they're both an outside entity  Something of which I cannot experience life through  This means I look at them as more connected together than I am with either of them    I'm more alone than the other people I meet  but they're more alone than me  We all share this common aloneness  this sense of loneliness  And we can experience it together    Coming together doesn't remove that feeling  Might make it easier to cope with  I'm not sure  This is just what I've been thinking about as I become less bitter and try to reach out to people more     I think it also causes a bit of a vicious cycle  When you feel lonely you want a connection with other people  So it makes sense that the "cure" to your loneliness is company  But company doesn't change that fundamental aloneness  In fact  in my experience  group company can make it worse  By directly seeing Steve and Paul talking  you experience that sense of difference and enhanced aloneness    Company then enhances your loneliness instead of helping it  So now  feeling even more lonely you start to think something is wrong with you  Other people have such strong connections with each other  it's different to how you connect with people  "What's wrong with me " you start to think  "Why can't I get close to people "  And it's not like they don't like you  nor you them  You just don't feel close to them  There's a distance    The way I then see it  the answer to dealing with loneliness is understanding that fundamental aloneness and dealing with accepting that  How do you do that  Good question    I think it's easier to do sometimes than other time  We all have moments of weakness    Don't mean to too my own horn but I feel this understanding of loneliness has helped me immensely both in regards to myself and others  There's nothing wrong with the person surrounded by friends feeling lonely  nor is there anything wrong with the person almost entirely alone not feeling lonely  or vice versa   
Sometimes OCD still affects me when I'm drinking  sometimes it doesn't  It's a nice bonus if it doesn't    That said  I am starting to consider the theory that alcohol may make my OCD better at the time  but it may also mean the OCD is likely to be worse the following day 
This just made my year
Oh my gosh  I didn't even think the reason I "forget" to rush my teeth might be my depression  That or I just don't remember 
An anti depressant combined with therapy works well  To assume that only one thing is a cure is a grey area in mental health  
Happy New Year to you too  Rob 
That sucks  it does  but life isn't all about getting chicks  I'm sure you have a lot more going for you  and a lot more to live for   
Finally could meditate a bit with the guided relaxation from the FAQ after lost my motivation for it for months cause I'm pretty sure I got ripped off by the 400  "t    meditation" 
it's ok  I appreciate it anyway
I know absolutely nothing about these other drugs  but fwiw my cardiologist gave me propranolol  60mg 1x daily  to try to calm me down and control racing heartbeats  I haven't tried it yet since I'm kind of nervous to try any medication    Well actually I tried a 20mg pill of it once and it calmed me down but in this uncomfortable groggy kind of way 
Hi all and Happy New Year with hope atleast   Answer to the question  not dreaming about my straight plan but doing it actually   I'm 26 from Hungary  everyone in my family got some kind of not extreme disorder  anxiety  depression  panic etc  Pretty sure I got some kind of GAD since I was 12 maybe  wasn't this bad at the beginning it was only in situations like when I had to speak in front of my classmates and ordering in restaurants even my speaking started to stutter   now from the moment I wake up until I try to sleep  it just comes without any long thinking and taking myself into panic  it's not panic attack but the feeling normal people got when they'll hear the most important news of their lifes and worse than that  feels like almost my open awakened mind is in solitary confinement  I can openly speak about it  searching for a therapist right now  sadly everyone I'm in contact with only worsens the situation  I've no idea how in all these years I not searched for this sub 
I wasn't saying you didn't have anxiety  I'm obviously not qualified to say  No offence intended    You said he's shy too  so what if you both like each other  and you're both beating yourselves up for not telling each other  I think if someone gave me a letter poem text saying they liked me  and were a little shy to tell me face to face  I wouldn't think they didn't deserve me  I'd honestly be flattered that they pushed past their insecurities to tell me  I think you should go for it  Like you say  you both chose to spend New Years together instead of with anyone else  and I think that says a lot  Go for it  I'm sure you won't regret it  it could be the start of something awesome  And if nothing comes of it  at least you know and can move on  Good luck with what ever you choose   
I guess at this point all we can really do is put our head down  charge forward and forget our feelings until it gets better  That seems like my number one option right now
I wish I could cry it hurts so much having everything holed up inside but you can't let it out

Mediocre  Definitely not  that is awesome   Well done you  that's an achievement    I think it's definitely hard to do things once you've been disheartened  but definitely we should keep on trying  as you have  
I don't have any friends in my town to compare myself to  However  I did spend New Year's Eve with my wife  She is divorcing me  Before midnight she told me that our separation is only a legal requirement and that otherwise she would be going straight for divorce  We went to bed in separate rooms not having seen the new year 
Tonight Reddit was my special someone
Good job  Maybe you could reward yourself with something that doesn't cost anything  Like a walk in the park  or you could check out a museum you haven't seen before  If you're into that sort of thing     
Why does it keep you up at night  Because you don't find that sort of existence fun  There are plenty that don't  my friend  I am with you on this one  I don't find that kind of life appealing either  
I brush my teeth in the shower  If you're gonna be standing there for a while waiting for your hair to get wet or leaving conditioner in for a minute  might as well brush your teeth while you wait 
How come 
I just want to give you a hug right now thank you  
Hope you get better soon cause this sucks   
Why wouldn't you be able to get medication and keep it hidden  You're 18  it's your body  your choice  
I feel like this almost all the time now  I guess the only thing I could suggest would be to try to force yourself to do something out in the world  The only good memory I have of the last year was forcing myself to go to a concert  even though I have no friends to go with and I wanted to just skip it and retreat back to my room  I surprised myself by actually feeling excited and happy as a result of this  and the feelings carried over to the days after the concert  For me at least  going out to do something helped me a lot in feeling more connected to things 
I understand to being alone in surrounded by friends  I felt it before being all alone  The thing that I don't understand is when they are praising the aloneness they are complaining about being alone by surrounded by people  Well  don't stay with them then  It's not hard to be alone 
Happy new years to you too  Here's to hoping 2017 is better  
thank you so much  if you need someone to talk to you can always hit me up as well  im on reddit quite a lot 
Hey and good vibes all    I'm honestly pretty glad I discovered this as I'm in a dark place atm  I'm just turned 21  from New Zealand  really into life  sports  science  music  Generally really chill dude  super positive and smart  I was until I majorly fucked up  and decided to try lsd  which gave me a huge panic attack   went into er   I was diagnosed with GAD since as I feel constantly out of it and mentally restless  I mentally can barely cope with anything now and constantly have anxiety  Honestly don't know what's wrong with me  but feel like my mind is shattered  Peace all  atm i'm just trying to find things to stay positive about  e g  being alive 
I wrote a comment explaining my understanding of loneliness that I think might help you if you're interested in giving it a read  here  https   www reddit com r depression comments 5lb631 id rather be all alone than feel alone in crowd dbv5l4h      I can't tell you how to stop hating yourself  but I can tell you that I used to hate myself and was in a bad place in High School as well  After High School I gradually became less bitter  made jokes about how great I was    then the jokes gradually stopped being jokes  It seems for most people it gets better with age  It doesn't for everyone  but there's always hope there     I can't tell you how to deal with loneliness or depression  I can explain loneliness as I understand it and hope that helps  I can recommend therapy to deal with depression  Otherwise  again  those both often get better after High School  High School is a messy place full of teenagers with messy hormones  It can be hard     I can't tell you how to keep your friends either  But I can suggest you look up things like the book "How to Win Friends and Influence People"  or the youtube channel "Charisma on Command" and think about how you come across to others  The way we act  even subtly can affect how people perceive us  being aware of that and changing even minor things  Like saying 'I don't mind'  instead of 'I don't care'  can make drastic improvements on how you come across     One more thing  I started to feel much better when I stopped caring about being more invested in the friendship  relationship  whatevership  Oddly it made me both more and less invested  I invite people to do things  or start up conversations with people just because I want to  If they don't want to  I don't mind  I give friendship out as I want like a gift  not expecting anything in return  I think people often WANT to be a better friend  they WANT to be there for you  but they don't know how      You say you're fat too  I'd suggest you change that  Not even to stop people teasing you or anything  Fuck 'em  Plenty of fat people are incredibly popular  But you've stated that you hate yourself and have low self esteem  I believe losing weight will be a step in the right direction in that regard  Keep it simple  just replace soft drink with water  Or  if replacing it altogether is too much  just drink a glass of water before you have any soft drink and you'll drink much less  Gradually replace your bad dietary habits with good ones  By 2018 you won't even recognise yourself     You're young and you want to improve  you're gonna do fine 
I don't think you are being over sensitive  I think everything in your post is relevant and spot on  I've only been using this sub for a few days now  but I can honestly say that this seems like the place when you can voice your opinions fears problems and not be judged  I feel like this is a safe zone  no judgment  labelling or laughing here  
And I am sure they do  You said you have friends  this girl was interested in you  so surely she must have enjoyed your company 
Same  She is completely dependent on me  She needs me for even the most basic of needs like water  If I killed myself  would anyone find her in time  If I sent out a message asking someone to take care of her  would they end up "saving" me  If I could convince my wife to take both dogs when she moves out  I think that would be best for everyone    
Oh man I can relate to the not cool bit so hard  Like at this point I know I'm weird but it's like  it's kinda lonely being the weird one  Ive tried fitting in  but at somepoint it just looks sad trying and not succeding  so lately I've been doin my own thing for the most part  At least my cats don't judge   
This is too real  Wow  Well done OP  You did good 
If you are worried about it speak to a counsellor or therapist for a proper diagnosis   It does sound like some kind of anxiety issue though  yes 
Something about your tone just makes me think you're on a good path  I'm optimistic you'll have a good 2017  I've been dealing with bipolar for years as well  and slowly getting better and better at managing it  Best of luck to us both   
I do see where you're coming from  the idea of just leaving the group if it makes you feel worse is definitely simple    But  while it's a simple concept  it IS hard to be alone  When you're lonely you crave a connection with other people  To bring yourself to leave people and go back to being alone is hard  You have to pull yourself away from what you want  back to what you want to avoid 
Hey  first off I just wanna say I'm sorry too hear your being bullied  people just like too pick on people who are different  It doesn't mean anything is wrong with you  really nothing is  just that you don't fit the norm  Just keep being yourself    I might not be able too help very much honestly but here's my 2 cents   If it wasn't for different activities high school would of been much worse for me   Admittedly  I only really had "school friends" in high school  but still it helped  By activities I mean things like sports  band  choir  and things like that    It helps to distract yourself from loneliness sometimes  Find something you enjoy and do it when your feeling down    Idk of a way too improve your self esteem really  Maybe just try working out and getting in shape or just accomplishing some achievement     Also I think the key too making friendships really making the effort to hung out in person or at least talk on the phone or something    I hope this helps even if just alittle  I wish you luck 
Right there with you  My life dramatically collapsed  it's now significantly smaller  The holidays are a great way to measure how things are going  They are not going well  This is probably my last Christmas 
Ok  sad to hear     Zero labido I don't mind really  I'm not in a relationship anyway   I've hard about withdrawal  but you only have to experience that when you go off them so unless you do that often it's not that bad  Brain zaps sounds horrible    Which two are you on  Which have you tried  Any particular one which worked better or worse   Thanks for taking your time to answer  Hope you can get better  
I went to bed at 11  woke up at 7  Checked phone  no text messages  
You should watch a good TV show  It's a great waste of time and its certainly better than watching random videos  I recommend The Wire or The Sopranos

Look  I'm sure you have heaps to offer and lots of girls would love to get to know you  But as lonely as being single can be  relationships aren't the be all and end all  Have you tried dating  online or otherwise

Broken link  Aw no  I thought that one would go   Hmm  Maybe it's the Facebook privacy settings  Well anyhoo  Happy New Year to you  and I hope you too will enjoy using the prospect of delicious cake as a carrot on a stick to encourage you to overcome problems getting out and about  THE CAKE IS WORTH IT heh    
Well  I suppose you're right  Thank you for that  thank you very much 
It can most definitely be helpful  Don't be afraid of trying out a few therapists until you find one that you think works for you  Bad therapists exist  so do ones that you won't get along with  Find one that works for you though and they can definitely help you work through your problems    The last part is key though  They can help you work through your problems  they can't work through your problems for you  Nobody can do that     And one more thing  I didn't have friends pretty much all through High School  I had a group of friends in Primary School but I was always a little isolated from them then  and in High School we drifted even further apart  The most socialising I did was in an MMORPG  in which I had the closest things to friendship I'd ever known at the time  Things changed a lot after High School though  so it can definitely get better with age 
Idc  I hate this body  And it wouldn't matter anyways   And women are at least more able to ask for help  But nvm  I don't want to start anything here 
That's why it's a practice  Good luck 
Just at night or when you're tired  When I was depressed  whenever I got tired any negative feelings I had were amplified  A friend has expressed the same thing  Even now  I'm in a very good place in my life  when I'm tired I can get more down than normal    If I eat and sleep well this effect is mitigated  Eating a generally healthy diet and sleeping consistent early hours  Always getting up at 7am  going to bed at 10 30pm  and no screen time past 9 30pm  All leads me to feeling more energetic and better 
Happy new year and congrats on taking the first steps towards improving your health  
As someone who just hit major dental pain from not brushing for years  you will definitely thank yourself  I've had kidney stones  too  and I really don't know which is worse    Congrats for sticking with your goal 
Doing it anyways  Even if it makes us look like a total social idiot  
Hi  Ilnetaevre  Happy New Year  and congratulations on rocking that resolution  First steps are always really hard  so good on you for taking them  It's really great that you're working together with your doctor  too  and I can imagine that wasn't easy to begin with  either  Keep up the good work   Personally  I don't really know anything about modelling  but I'm sure there's a subreddit for it  And tons of them for video games  of course 
Oh I misunderstood  I'm sorry  So you mean like wasting your time in life  Well I will say everyone worries about that  It's a big subject  Can you give us more context  What made you think about this topic 
Of course not  Please take this day for yourself to recover  Try not to be so anxious about calling off either  Have you ever tried meditation  It's been the only thing to help me with my anxiety and depression  
Yeah man  I can get 99  right and all I see is that one wrong  it consumes me and drives me to madness  I am not 'happy' unless I see something wrong with myself 
Hey look its totally normal to feel scared to lose your parents everyone feels frightened when that thought crosses their mind but let me tell you that you should try focusing on now rather than the future try spending more time with them and make them happy and death is not the end you'll eventually reunite with them again but just spend time doing what you love and with people you love and dont let that thought ruin your days  your parents will be safe and so will you just keep telling yourself that 
I agree with you  But if you don't understand me then don't underestimate my pain  When you do this  it's just growing my pain and growing my despair   this was for them  not for you 
Glad too hear that you are still alive  but sad to hear that you're still suffering  May I ask if you know why you are in such a dark place 
I would give you a gold if I wouldn't be broke  On a similar note I think  unfortunately you can't always change the circumstances  in a short period of time   but you can your attitude in which you might find solace  but that's a slippery slope 
While it also is illegal to even live outside in lots of places  let alone hunt or fish without a permit  Not you in particular  but people often seriously say "oh you don't like society  Go live in the wild then " meanwhile the lifestyle society forces upon people far pervades that    Hell   they just made it illegal in Florida to have a home not connected to the electric and water utility companies  No off grid living in Florida without paying a private corporation for the privilege 
Take care of yourself 
Yep  Find yourself some different friends  buddy  Depends on your age group  but you can find a lot of people into things other than drinking  getting high  getting laid  etc   I always think that looking at what you do for hobbies is the best place to start  A lot of times you can find clubs or meetups for those things locally and meet people there 
The labido thing isn't a big deal to me either  but puts a strain on my marriage    I have been on about 12 drugs  so going off them can be a big deal  I think it took me nearly six monthes to get off of lexapro   I am current on imipramine and quetiapine   In the past I have been on  Paxil  celexa  Prozac  lexapro  bupropion  sertraline     I think that's it     I haven't noticed any making any difference whatsoever   Probably the best thing has been exercise  particularly running  but I am injured right now and can't run   Hope this helps 
Thank you so much   At least I'm not the only one ahahahah
This was the year that I decided to avoid social media at all costs on both christmas and new years and it was the best decision I could have made  For the first time I could actually enjoy the situation and the people that were in front of me rather than comparing myself to what everybody else was doing  
I used to get this while running  Using an elliptical  which gives your body some momentum  helps  while exercising  
Well then how did you write this 
I like to sleep but I don't sleep well
Yup  And yet you want it so much  Such a vicious self deprecating circle  
Aw I'm so sorry   but you're not gonna through this alone  Every time I got my heart broken  it made me a stronger person  so I'll be praying and hoping your 2017 will be better after this day  
Hiya  McDonalds employee of 2 years here   Obviously your Wendy's part spoke to me the most  Of course you felt shame at first  Society practically trains everyone to scoff at people who work jobs like that  But what I learned very  very quickly as someone who also had almost no work experience prior to McDonalds  is that the job teaches you healthy humility  resilience and the ability to work under pressure  IMO  these traits are extremely beneficial to someone with anxiety   What I mean by healthy humility is that you don't think low of or hate yourself  but rather respect for being able to work a job many others think themselves "too good" to do  Someone has to give these people their food every day  Someone has to clean the bathrooms  Someone has pick up trash off the roadways  Without them  it flat out  doesn't get done    I think you should try again  Maybe not at Wendy's but really at whatever job gives you the chance  Because if you stick with something and learn those traits  you'll become a respectable employee in time  I know exactly what it's like to show up to work at first and be terrible at your job and have managers belittle everything you do  Now  they're practically begging me not to go every time i announce a vacation   You haven't given yourself enough of a chance to declare yourself a bad worker  Give yourself a real chance to shine and make a living in life  I thought myself the same before I really decided I wasn't going to give up for a change  Put up with the crap that comes with the early days of a new job  and see if you can turn it around  I'm pretty certain that if someone like me can  you can too 
If this is a symptom of an illness it's unlikely to improve on it's own  I don't know how old you are or where you live  but here in the UK it's relatively easy to see a doctor anonymously  I believe the cutoff for when they can't tell your parents what you tell them is 16  If you can't see a doctor anonymously you should consider explaining your situation for full to your parents in order to get help 
Hey  I wish you a very happy new year   
Congrats on 3 5 months sober  I too surprisingly stayed sober for New Years  I'm tired of drinking away my problems    Also sorry for all the loss you have experienced this year  It seems like one of those years that's just filled with so much death     people around here passing too early  too  I just want you to know that if you can keep a sober and positive ish attitude through all that  the only way you can go is up  Keep your head up  Know an internet stranger is proud of you  The betrayal from your gf will stop stinging and you'll find a girl that actually deserves you  And hopefully it'll be awhile before you have to attend another funeral    All the best for you this year      
I hope the same for you  I'm right there with you  Having a mini meltdown because of it as we speak     gotta love it  
Thank god I'm not the only one struggling with such a mundane task  I'm so happy to hear that you managed to brush everyday   you really deserve a reward  well done

On my iPhone    And I certainly didn't indicate that any of this was rational  because it's clearly not 
Also be careful the first time you try this for anxiety  I did this when I was 19  didn't know what type  and my heart started going 3 or 4 times a second  started freaking out so bad that streets seemed 100x as long as they were in reality    I've heard there are types that calm you down and types that hype you up  Personally I'm not a fan of this solution but if you consider it  please do your research before you end up in a panic attack   But I'm glad it helps you  OP     
2016 was the worst year for me too  It was the year where I finally broke  after years of holding on  Instead of fighting against it I finally gave up and let it overwhelm me  So 2017 will be worse and worse  The longer 2016 went the worse it got for me  I probably won't be alive for 2018  Or even the majority of 2017  Who knows  Who cares  
I am feeling better  thankfully  Nice quiet nite and home with hubby  I barely made it to 10pm  no ball drop for me  Did you make it

Ah yes doing good deeds in public i know how that feels when you have SA and feel some eyes looking at you  I have passed on doing some of those just because of the fear of awkwardness and having strangers looking at me  Try not to beat yourself too hard over this your family will let go of this incident pretty soon and you will have other chances to help others  If you get the occasion to be alone and you see some elderly person again i'd suggest that you go help that person even if you get the anxiety after you do it you will feel better about yourself i know this from own experience And besides there won't be too much convo either just "ah that's so sweet of you thank you young man" pretty much You just reply with "take care have a good day i'm glad i could help" and go to your business  Happy new year to you too   
Sense8 is great  Did you watch the Christmas special  And I think season 2 comes out in a few months  
The thing is that I know they're not gossipping  My colleagues are all mature adults  not into emotional stuff or drama and they just do their job    It's more like I hear myself laugh with myself and my actions  but the 'evil inner voice' is using the sound of their voices  Does that make sense  I know it sounds weird but that's the only way I can explain it 
No problem    It can happen to everyone 
Like u folgaluna said  check out rainn org for how to support her  That being said  if she doesn't want to proceed with charges  or tell her parents  that's entirely up to her  I would support her and encourage her to tell them and to press charges  but I wouldn't pressure her  However  the sooner she presses charges the more likely she will win the case in my experience  Good luck 
I was 'laid back' as well  but it was me avoiding all responsibility and thoughts of the future because of that feeling of anxiousness you get    When I was about to graduate  or start my own company  or make a big change I would be horribly stressed   I had to learn to recognize and deal with my anxiety in the good times to avoid getting really bad sometimes 
Just to add  below is an exact description of how I feel but missing a few extra thing   You feel low  like really low  you've never felt this way before you feel like nothing could ever make you happy  nothings going your way and everything you love leaves  you feel like your life is a constant merry go round of the same shitty job and the same shitty routine with the same depressing faces  you feel alone  no matter what anyone says to you about love or life it's all empty words going in to an empty shell of a man that's been worn away at for years  no one cares  not really  they say they do but at the end of the day when it comes to them or you they always choose themselves over you and you know deep deep down that you'd chose them over you now and forever and no matter who it is they're this way  so what's the point  Why keep going round and round when things don't get better  they just get worse  the government don't give a fuck  family means fuck and and no one wants me  why not just end it all and get off the merry go round and stop the pain  I'm not talking pain as in sore headaches or cuts  I'm talking a pain that's unthinkable a numbness from deep down and swirling of the mind like water draining down the sink forever and ever  a never ending feeling of aloness and just bluntness that no matter what you do  what people say it never goes away  things you know  your mind says  that will make you happy it doesn't do it  it just won't work the numbness is still there that empty black hole of a void that can't be filled  
Ok thanks for your reply  Yeah I've worked out before but I also injured myself and then stopped so I know how it feels like       I certainly felt better than now when I worked out  but I didn't really feel   satisfied  Like I was still tired and negative and stuff like that  But I have a stationary bike in my little student apartment which I will try to use a few time every week from now on  At least that's what I promised myself      I think it's sad to hear that meds are not making any difference for you  I'm probably gonna try it anyway because I really feel like I'm about to just give up  But we'll see what the Dr says  
You did a good thing by going at least you had some fun which is nice  I tell you one thing nobody cares on NYE about what you said and how you said it most likely a good part of the people that were there got drunk ate some food and then went to bed so don't beat yourself up over this  I know how it feels when you get home and over analyze but i wouldn't worry too much on special ocasions like this people have other things in their minds in those moments and even if you said something awkward they will forget it by the time they get up 
I know plenty of people who swear by their meds  so no shame in trying

Do it  The first step is the hardest  but it feels so good  It's not going to have a simple easy answer but keep at it  I really hate keeping up on my health  I just don't FEEL like doing all the little things    Treat your body like it's a car  Gotta do the maintenance too keep things running  
Thanks for the suggestion  What's the difference between regular CBT and DBT  Can I do this by myself at home  I already see a therapist and we do some form of CBT and I don't want to change the therapy midway

Of course there are other men out there who are gay and fantasize about black men  You just have to go out and meet new people   I recommend you to use a dating app  Everything becomes easier because you can match with someone else who is also interested in you

Not yet  I will watch it this evening 
I've been trying and I've had no luck  Most people who match me unmatch me before we even talk  
  I've felt some of the same things  It's probably been a year since I've made my parents or anyone else proud  And I wish my opinion of the things I do wasn't just a constant thought that I'm making more mistakes      But instead of giving yourself a time limit  just give yourself time  You don't deserve to give up on yourself or be given up on  It's easy to see where you are now and look at the future as being the same or worse  but change happens whether we like it or not      There's no way to predict time  even for people who seem like they have it all together  You'll find a chance to change things one day OP  and it will be on perfect timing  Stay strong

I can somewhat relate  I'm not sure what to say here  I'm a bit drunk  but you struck a chord in my heart there so I wanted to say something   I'm a white gay male who is spending this New Years alone  Well I did  I'm in Australia so it's the night of the first for me   I did get to spend time with a good mate and have a nice time but on the way home today I was surrounded by drunk 18 year olds  It was so in my face being surrounded by beautiful young men in tank tops  I dunno  just incredibly aware that I haven't even been kissed in 3 years  And they say your 20's are the prime of your life    So having recently been reminded what I am not anymore and having had body issues most of my life  You have my sympathy  Possibly some understanding and a friendly person to talk to if need be       I hope much has changed for the better in the past five hours   X

Thank you for the support  It's just nice to know that someone else understands 
you get an espresso machine  you prepare espresso a night before  you put it right next to your bed to be drunk in the morning    
I think I get what you mean and that I'm going through the same thing  If I may ask  what kinds of thoughts are running through your head    Sometimes I feel like the world is spinning clockwise  when I'm just sitting in the couch at home  mostly when I have anxiety  The first time I thought I accidentally got drugs in my food or something  Is that similar to what you feel  
Slept forever  Wish I could go back to that  Got a call from my sister  otherwise I'd forget I existed  
Yep  All I've been thinking about this morning  Only thing keeping me alive is my crippling anxiety  
i hope day 1 has already proved a success for you and that each day gets easier  
Lots of people understand xx

Therapy is the best thing you can do for yourself  You need the closure  You deserve to be able to live a happy life without refressing into the emotional trauma that you have lived  Remember that yiu will try to fight it and deny it as soon as tou start as your current state  not necessarily desirable  is the one you are comfortable with and you will try to keep it  Good luck and have faith that you can beat the anger and be a happier person 
  You sound like a very sweet and compassionate person to me  and I'm sorry for your loss      I know when I was 17  I had a bf and friends but only a couple of friends  They saw me go through a lot with depression and anxiety and it really does put a strain on relationships  My Mom was pretty strict too  and still is  I'm 20 now   She's still overprotective and it makes it harder to do all the things my friends like to do      But when I was in high school  I talked to her about the problems I was having and really just explained how I felt as much in detail as I could  We had a few disagreements but she did understand and loosened up a bit after that     Plus  I realized that it wasn't just the things around me that was causing my depression  it was a chemical imbalance  It's sad that not a lot of younger people realize this until later on or until it is too late     Without the right amount of chemicals in your brain  it's so much harder to deal  even with counseling  If I were you  I would talk to your parents about the way you're feeling  no matter how you think it might turn out      Also  see if you can get an appointment with your doctor and explain these things to him  It sounds weird  but they will help you  My whole senior year was one of the best I remember because I was on the right medication and I made friends a lot easier because of how I felt       Love you OP  stay strong         
i think you said a really important thing   "consciously reaffirming that my symptoms are from anxiety"  ultimately  what "we" are all dealing with is anxiety      and that is what is happening to us  not symptoms of a heart attack  but a symptom of anxiety

Met a girl online  now I think she's looking to date or at least fuck some kid who added her off my friends list  Never even met her but it's still got me down that someone I was hoping to at least go on a date with only acknowledges me when she's asking about a guy I barely know anything about outside of the fact that he used to be a junkie  
yes  yes  yes  i just stumbled across this sub after trying to find a cure to kick the anxiety in 2017  its very frustrating being the parent and child of your own brain  telling yourself youre going to be ok  verse telling yourself that everything bad is happening  exhausting  im with you for the rant  health anxiety is the worst  
Glad you're not depressed anymore but I don't think that's what the army is for 
Same here
Well if they have SA it's probably the easiest to approach woman on Internet knowing she has the same problem  Dreaming of rescuing you  accepting you and all that hopeless stuff 
A suggestion inspired by my therapist  Before you can get to any of those places  you have to know where they are   Make a list of the things you  would  be doing if anxiety were not getting in the way   These don't have to all be gigantic "find my soul mate" kind of things   One of the most mundane items on my list is to hire an electrician to get a range top microwave installed   Once you have the list perhaps you can identify one of the more 'doable' things at your current comfort level   Maybe there is a way to make some small progress there   Or discuss the list with your therapist or somebody else you trust 
That is great   D
yeah   shame I can't apply for US army     but whatever the aussie army does i wont be bored and depressed anymore

Sounds like my ex   It is the depression talking but also he recognizes he needs to do this alone   Men I think are different and feel they have to do it alone  whereas women are more open to talking to others openly  My ex contacts me every so often and I think he is working on himself and he wants me to know that  So I always try to support him by encouraging him but I never contact him first because he wants to do this on his own   It is very very hard but I want to respect him and his wishes   I still love him  but he has to do it on his own because that is what I heard many times 
Good job  OP   3
I went almost the whole night last night without having bad anxiety at my friends New Year's Eve party  I started to panic towards the end of the night but I was drunk enough to go to sleep  so I did  
I'm proud of you  OP   People don't realise how much effort it actually is to have personal hygiene 
Pleasantly strange  oldschool cool  that's what they are  Makes you cool 
Yep  it's kinda cliche  I think  but I always feel like an eternal observer  It's like I'm trapped in time and I see things again and again and I don't even want to live them  I'm just staring at it 
 removed 
No 
  When you don't have that many friends or family or no lover  Why the fuck should you care about your teeth   That's definitely how I feel about personal hygiene a lot of the time  Who gives a fuck if I don't "look representable"  when I don't even leave my house   But  really  we only get more sick from not having some level of hygiene 
100  I've developed such a routine in life due to anxiety and social anxiety that I go to work 40 hours a week and come home and hang with my family on weekends and weeknights  The thought of starting a relationship is hard because that means fornme breaking my routine when that's all I've known for about 5 years now

Happy new year   You sound like you're taking some solid steps into helping cure your anxiety in 2017   go you      
Good job for posting here  Happy New Year  
Can you see what has changed in the time when you went from being laid back to getting extremely stressed   You surroundings  your friends  your lifestyle  even food can have a tremendous effect on your thinking  which might have resulted in the shift of how you deal with things on a daily basis 
congrats  really brave of you 
I have this sometimes         Today I think it was a mix of going to bed relaxed and having the deepest sleep I've had in years  Perhaps you stayed up for new years day with family or friends and was distracted from normal anxieties or sadnesses which helped you to get a more relaxed sleep       Alternatively sometimes I feel better when I haven't had enough sleep so it could be that
Thanks for the advice man  I will start working on the inner voice as well i'm sick of being controlled and put down by it every time i want to get something done  I will look into electric stimulation as i have heard a lot of good things about it  Replaced the sugary stuff with fruit for some months now and i have lost a lot of weight Also i do bike alot when the weather is warm In my case the motivation is a mild acne and occasional breakouts that i have on my face which suck but they have somewhat disciplined me to eat healthier  Best of luck to you too 
He understand that  he even knows that is maybe a coping mechanism  but he cant tolerates anymore  I understand  I only ask him for patience  but he doesn't have too much for me at this moment  so my relationship I like or not  are at the abyss at this moment
It's a year until next new years eve  that's long enough for a positive change to happen  Talk to your family about their drinking and fighting and perhaps you can work together to make family occasions better in the future       If your brother is in the same situation I would suggest talking to him first  they're more likely to pay attention if it's coming from two people       Have a great 2017

Where do you live 
To those with this delima let's do an experiment  Ask yourself what would you do if you was the boss of your own life  Write that question big  And Everytime you feel anxious or depress write it under that question  Eventually you will have a list of things you like to do if you were in control  That's step 1   Step 2 is asking yourself how will I get there from the first list  Step 3 is upon looking at each entry ask yourself is or was it will it be worth it  
Fuck man  we gotta do something to get out of this shit   Try something and if you fail you'll back to square 1 but eventually you'll give zero fucks about failing   Trust me  I'm a complete fuckin' loser but I still feel like I can change my life   Good luck
Please find some help  There's nothing wrong with asking for it or needing it  A therapist can be an incredible help no matter what your problem   If you have some family  friends  or even acquaintances  reach out to them  I know you feel like nobody cares  but that's virtually never true  Unfortunately people can't always tell when something is wrong  so you have to tell them  I know what it's like to sit there and wish someone would text or call you  or sit in the same room with someone and wish they'd ask how you're doing  You just have to say "I need to talk "  From your recent post history it looks like you've been doing well in terms of alcohol and self harm  Four years sober and three weeks without cutting is no small feat  That shows that you're a strong person  Stronger than you might think or feel right now  I know that relapsing can really bring you down  even severely  But you can't think of it as all or nothing  You can't think of it as complete success or complete failure  You've already chalked up that much time where you've abstained from these things  You know how to handle urges  You can always get right back to it    Don't let a temporary state of mind decide your life  I'm sure you've heard it  and probably don't want to  but it's a permanent solution to a temporary problem  And taking your life is like taking the pain you're feeling  amplifying it ten times  and inflicting it on everyone who cares about you   You have the ability to push through this  You have people who care  Find them  Don't assume that they don't care just because they're not asking you how you're doing  You said you spent time making other people happy  If that means just being kind to them or acting happy when you're not or cheering them up when they're down  I guarantee that they noticed    I have a friend who is one of the nicest  most upbeat guys I know  After I was dumped a few months ago he was kind enough to give me advice and help me through it  That's when he told me that he was fully ready to commit suicide within the past year  Rope tied up and everything  I never would have suspected that  If I did I would've talked to him  and if he asked to talk I would've met up with him in a heartbeat   Please stick around  Message me if and when you need to  Ask someone for help  Talk to someone  Life is worth it  and you're fucking worth it   I know I'm only a stranger on the internet  but I wish you a very happy New Year 
You'll make a lot of mistakes in life  because we all do    The most important thing is that you think honestly about what went wrong and what you can do better in the future    It can be discouraging to fail  absolutely  But you should feel those feelings instead of ignore them  and then try and do better next time    If you'd ever like to talk  I am a teacher and a I have a psychology degree  Feel free to message me if you feel down or need help    I've worked with a lot of students who felt the same way 
Well done man  the only posts I've made on here lasted about 2 minutes before I have to delete them  
Thank you for the kind words    You were extremely lucky when you met your husband i am yet to meet the one but first i need to change my mindset indeed improve myself and then put myself out there more and be outgoing so i can have a chance  I would like a somewhat introverted girl like i am but it's hard to meet people that are alike because the introverted people are harder to find since they are more in "the back" making it more difficult to meet them 
What do you think is the problem  Why aren't you passing 
That's awesome    Keep it up    
You're not alone  the exact same thing happened to my friend  I can't imagine how it must feel but for him he was really upset  Hopefully it makes you feel better to know that the kind of person to do that isn't the kind of person that is good to date anyway dispite how nice they may have seemed before  People can be surprisingly different when they aren't able to sensor what they say and what you know through text       You'll find someone don't worry    
Many people only know how to play vid games and watch you tube  It takes effort to get a new hobby passion  No passion is dull 
What I used to do was go to events where I knew nobody and just try to become comfortable with being uncomfortable  I know that sounds weird  so let me explain  I would go to a bar or club and just sit there alone and not try put unnecessary pressure on myself by needing to come across as "likeable" or "cool" or whatever  Just sitting or standing there alone and becoming aware of what thoughts and emotions are going through me  So when I felt uneasy    I noticed it and just allowed it to be there  The interesting thing is that after a while  when you allow the feeling of discomfort to be there    it no longer is discomfortable  And you will start to see that everyone  although they might come across as relaxed and comfortable  is far more occupied with afraid of how people are judging them  than with judging you  Once you are able to be ok with feeling that discomfort then it becomes much easier to connect with people 
I think i have missed some good occasions when i've said no to people or certain events This year i will do my best to convince myself to get a job maybe an internship and go out more if i have the occasion  After i've developed SA it was hard to go out and try new things because i was supposed to get out of my "bubble" and i chose the easy way but as more time passes i'm getting disappointed at myself for not doing anything new and always having the "sleep university come home and stay at the PC sleep repeat" 
I believe that i actually have the motivation to study  but my parents are constantly behind me nagging to study and I seriously cant focus on studying if they are nagging me 24 7  it puts me off    
Nah  it's been 5 years and I'm only getting older  
Thank you  And I agree  I'll try to get of shape  I also think that'd help loads  Thank you 
Maybe it's certain people that triggers it

Haven't had it myself but I'm really happy for you  it is a sign of things getting better  Thanks for sharing it's always nice to see that people's situations can improve
Same  would have been absolute worse year had it not been the year I picked up the fiddle 
Thank you so much love   I agree with you    I think my problem is more with the environment  maybe when I start college it'll be different  Hopefully it will   And I think I'll get better with time  Thank you so much for your kind words  I truly appreciate it 
I can't study when I'm home I need to completely change environment  Why don't you do your study in a local library  That way you improve your focus and avoid your parents altogether

Yep i have realized that if i do something productive i do it for myself and i do believe that once i get to a certain point and i'm happy with my own being i will start becoming more positive and maybe then i will attract more people around me maybe even a SO  I was also thinking of starting doing some calisthenics daily as a way to get disciplined and get myself in the mood I know that once i start doing something productive it becomes a habit after a while the thing that is the hardest is just the starting point cause i have to convince myself to do it I'm planning to convince myself this year because i have wasted so much time that i have become a ghost and i'm starting to get sick of the boring life with no purpose that i'm leading right now 
I get it too  I feel like I don't deserve the things and what little people that I do have in my life  Just don't give up   I had a rough couple of months a bit back  and I thought I wasn't going to 'make it'  and 'hanging in there' was horrible  with no interest in doing anything and it was so boring and I was paranoid and all kinds of stuff  but if you go through stuff just 'hang in there'  as they say   only thing else I can think to tell you is that you'll never be happy all of the time  I won't either  none of us will   it's just the name of the game I guess  
Good job on saying it  I was bullied by two of my so called 'friends' and bringing it up on my own initiative was so difficult the first few times  But in the process I've learned slowly  bit by bit  whom to open up about it  and have talked to a lot of understanding people about it    I also have terrible coping mechanisms  I mostly play video games to pass the time  I am smart as my mother constantly reminds me  but all I see are my failures  I only find happiness from other people  I am always angry and sad  and this paragraph is a mess and now I'm crying   For nearly a decade I was similar  I simply refused to properly open up  And it took quite a bit to get better  Happiness feels like something alien you know  Not something you experience  it's something other people have  Just like connections   I've managed to do a bit better over the time  Hopefully you will do better as well  Even admitting that yes  you do have problems  can be a difficult thing  That takes a special kind of strength on it own  And I'm glad that you have it   I hope that the sun will rise for you  Happy 2017   hugs 
I have started reading a book on procrastination as that's my biggest problem which is caused by my SA It's called "Eat that frog" by Brain Tracy it has got some good ideas and principles that i want to apply  After i'm done with that i want to read some more books on SA included cause i know that reading about your issue does help 
My parents sadly dont let me go out to study as they believe that home is the best conducive environment  
If your rationale is strong then I can be disproved  Maybe you just need a different environment  Have you thought about trying something new this year  
This happens nearly every time I drink  which is why I don't too much anymore  I always just try to remind myself that a couple days from now these fears will be long gone  it calms it a little bit 
Don't say that get some help instead There are are things that can heal you be it therapists books meditation or medication  Instead of finding the courage to commit suicide why not find the courage to start making a change for the better     Take care of yourself dude 
Maybe for you  For me  95  of the times that I'm sad it's because everyone around me is in love  facebook is telling me how many people I know are getting married or engaged  and I can't even watch tv without every show and movie rubbing romance in my face    I live a decent life overall  but I've been single for a stupid amount of time for someone my age  I'm not saying I will never be sad in a relationship  but if someone loved me  most of my triggers wouldn't exist anymore 
OkCupid  Tinder  Match  and every site in between for the past 6 years  Nothing works 
I get what you're saying i am too believing that you have to be in a shitty place to realize that you want to truly get out and become better Been like this for several years now i'm getting sick of it So i will really push myself to make a change  I have set some small goals and i will also write them on paper to remind myself every day when i wake up I have started eating healthier since last summer and i have seen the effects The next thing is to start taking small steps in working out 
I guess if your choice is Hospital or clozaril  you have to choose which one of those is more uncomfortable for you    Clozaril has a list of somewhat unfortunate potential side effects  but they are potential ones  Meaning  not everyone gets them and it's highly dependent on the individual who takes it  Seven people could come on here and tell you their experience and all seven of those could be wildly different    Many people decide that the side effects  if any  are worth having their minds back once they experience that  It is a very effective medication  It is honestly known to be one of  if not  the most effective medications for the symptoms you are describing  The only reason it is not prescribed more often is an extremely rare blood disorder than can develop  It's almost unheard of it is so rare  It requires that  especially at the beginning  you go in for a weekly lab draw  The pharmacy will not be able to fill your prescription unless they have the results of that lab work  It's a highly regulated special registration system for that med that pharmacies have to go through  If you miss your lab work  you don't get your prescription  They cannot give it to you  There may be a one day exception or something but in general  that is regulated by the FDA  so I don't think they have much leeway  I have two pharmacists in my family who practiced for over 25 years and neither one of them ever saw anyone have signs of the blood issue ever  They don't know any pharmacists who have either  It's a very rare issue    The other thing to keep in mind  is like any med  if you take it and it becomes unbearable in terms of side effects  where they outweigh the benefit of the drug  you can talk to your doctor about changing  If the side effects cause you so much distress that your quality of life is crap  then clearly the drug isn't worth it  Your doctor should be able to see that and work with you  A prescription is not a marriage  It's just a "try it and see "
Well   I can't say that I've ever been good with Excel  What kind of call center do you work for though  I feel like that would be an interesting job  In some ways talking on the phone makes me just as anxious as talking to people face to face  But in other ways  it might be more manageable  
So what if you are bisexual  lol  I see nothing wrong in it  even if you are straight  sometimes you can get a little "gay" lol    
That's me at least  you can be straight  just a little more open minded 
Oh I think I found your problem  For me home is the worst place to study by far  unless you have a study room with no bed or distractions  you will definitely get distracted because that's the place you use for fun and rest  You have to separate where you work and where you rest or your mind just won't allow you to get a good rest or focus when you have work to do  
Since the beginning of 2016 my life has been a downward spiral  I see no end to this in 2017 also
So you've been single for a whopping 9 months after 4 years of relationship  Sounds like you're doing quite well in comparison to me  I've spent the last  oh lets see  my entire life  alone minus the few relationships that lasted a few months at best  Oh and I'm not waiting til 90  I almost put a bullet through my head 2 days before Christmas  90 is simply impossible 
Update  Got plastered for NYE  Managed to keep myself happy with close friends around and some other substance abuse 
I lost all of mine basically  I've made a lot of friends in the past 3 years  I lost them mostly due to distance  sometimes because of conflicts or fights of sorts  frankly  trying to change yourself is obsolete  sometimes it isn't your fault  it's just the natural human selfishness  it's not because people despise you  it's simply because we the people  are cold fucks most of the times  people get new opportunities  and people move on  people like to experience new things  we have this grudge with the past  and most of the time  we tend to value more past relationships  frankly relationships are seasonal  every friendship  every romance  everything has a due date  either by human conflict or things beyond our control  nobody ever cares to say goodbye  they just move on  adapt  I feel stuck on the same place  ever and ever again  I can't move on  the way I can move on  is I just destroy myself mentally  and wind up somewhere  but  changing yourself is prone to only benefit you short term  I've tried it a lot  but you can't hide your true self  I accepted myself  but doesn't mean I am comfortable being myself  it's complicated     Anyway  sorry if my rambling might have seemed a bit out of place  frankly  people will invest in you if you invest in yourself  I know what you mean  by being a downer  when we spread our bad energy towards others  it's turn off  but  try to find other ways to discharge that negative energy  it's hard  but it's the only way 
Don't be sorry it's not a waste of time if it helps you vent  Why do you think you're boarding  
Thankyou
If only we hadn't been born without the natural gift of charisma they take for granted so easily   
Thanks for the advice i have looked into cross fit and i liked what i saw Seems like an interesting and interactive form of workout  I might give it a try if i find a decent gym that does CF  If i could make some friends as well at the gym like you did i'd have absolutely no problem with motivation  Glad to hear that it has made a positive change in your life best of luck to you and keep going    
That makes sense     for now i do everything in 1 room  ill try what you say  thanks for your concerns  
Have you talked to your boyfriend about your feelings 
Thank god  Thank you for answering  D habe a nice day dude
also thank mr skeltal for good bones and calcium
That means so much my whole life no one has said nicer things I'm going to hold off on suicide for now and just try and focus on work thanks a lot for the kind message  
I do agree that it's like nothing matters at all and connecting with people for real seems impossible  I don't know if the expectation is unrealistic or I'm impatient or what  I wish I could let someone in and have them see but it's like nobody even wants to go that deep  And if I did let them in they'd just be freaked by what they see  I don't know  I wanna tell you one day you'll find something real  That's what I bank on  But I can't promise you
Wish I had that feeling  Everytime I get a text it's the feeling of  "Oh great  now what " or "Who's asking for a favor now "  I'd much rather have a phone call anyways  Gets the conversation done in one minute of talking as opposed to five ten minutes of texting  Plus you avoid the whole "Did they get my text " feeling too 
I Play league of Legends but i am new  D
Thank you for the motivation I will definitely try meditation as i've been suggested so by multiple people including here  I have too grown sick of being a prisoner to SA and doubt so i have to adopt the mindset that getting out of my comfort zone is good for me and just do it After all nobody can do it for me as you said and i don't want to keep living a monotone life forever so hopefully this thought will be good enough to get me going  Good luck to you too 
Or you'll give zero fucks about repeating something you know the outcome to 
Glad to hear it   Again  don't hesitate to message me if you need to  
I know how you feel man  it's terrible  A girl came into my life and changed everything  made me love life again  but she left and became a completely different person and now i'm sill in love with the idea of her  not her anymore because she doesn't exist  she changed    but the idea of her  Coping with heartbreak is much harder when it's mixed with depression and social anxiety  And i know i didn't offer any advice or help  i just hope you feel better knowing someone is going through something exactly like you  you ain't alone  
Stayed at home  ate pizza  hung out with My SO and our kitten  Also watched Magnificent 7  Perfect anti social night

You can develop SA indeed I too was outgoing and more confident when i was younger a kid basically  but after some negative experiences that made me doubt myself and lose my confidence i have  become trapped in this "bubble" for so long now that it has become a habit to stay in it and avoid any situation that forces me to get out of it  The more time passes the more you become engulfed in it and the monotone lifestyle of being socially anxious becomes something normal 
Same  I often feel like I'm not 'in the world'  because a person doesn't seem to exist without connections and I've spent most of my life cutting ties or hiding away  in expectation of rejection  But then I read posts on reddit and I know that other people are feeling the same or suffering worse  And that they exist  and they are brave enough to post how they're feeling    
I am a teacher  As you can imagine SA caused me to leave my job  After a few years I am teaching again  You can escape SA  The key is whether you really want to  Dig deep  accept that you will face some uncomfortable moments  take one day at a time  When you have a bad day just leave it behind and focus on the progress you have made   Good luck 
I do  I just posted about it last night similarly to you  I don't know what to do  I feel like a doormat because I just keep caring and continue to let it happen  People say to find better but I try and can't either cause nobody else wants me around or because everyone behaves the same way  I try to ignore it or act like it doesn't matter  that I'll somehow hit the jackpot and find the best boyfriend or best couple of friends who'll actually care but to be honest with you  I don't think it's gonna happen  So I essentially lie to myself and just pray naively I'm right  
Congratulations guys  If you're reading this  it means you survived 2016  Let's try surviving 2017  Even if 2016 sucked and 2017 will suck harder for sure   
Same here  I really want to try improv and hope that it will help with SA 
I feel exactly the same way  
2016 was one hell of a downward spiral and I don't know where I'm supposed to find the motivation to keep going  It's not like I see anything getting better    my car's fucked  I'm too injured to walk to a job  I can't make rent  I'm unattractive  I'm too quiet  or too awkward  or too slow for anyone else    Why am I still on this planet 
I know this feeling all to well and it's terrible  If you ever need someone to talk to just message me  
I know the feeling well  Especially with getting older its doesn't make "feeling connected" any easier  You're taking a huge step just by talking about it you really can't keep that bottled up it will just eat your insides  I try to focus on the things that really matter in my life  So no I might not have a ton of people that I could text to just randomly but my family is my rock and they would do anything for me 
This is so me  We must be the same person  p
It could be nocebo effect   you assume the generic will be worse as it's cheaper not branded  so you feel a negative effect 
It does  It's bleak during the day  at night it's full on anguish    I don't remember the last time I had a good night of sleep   Night time is the worse  But weirdly enough  I like the night better  It's quieter  Fewer reminders that I should be out there  functioning so    there's that   
Feel like shit  get angry and fall asleep  then regret all of it when I wake up

I get what you're saying and Rowling's words have me some hope as well I am aware that i am currently stuck in a bad place but i do hope for the best in the coming year and that i will have the mindset to change for the better NYE and Christmas are somewhat normal days for me because i really don't do much except have a meal with my family and then stay at the computer or watch a movie but i do see alot of happy people around me that are happy with themselves in this time of year and it kinda makes me reflect on what i have done for myself therefore making me disappointed in myself because i have wasted so much time because of my anxiety I want to change that in 2017 so i can be happy with myself as well at the end of the year Christmas and NYE will still be normal days for me but hopefully with a positive reflection on my actions 
I get this to an extreme with my boyfriend's family  If there's an occasion  I ask him not to say "Can Ash come " because they may feel pressured into saying yes  If they want me there  they'll say "Invite Ash if you like"  If I'm not invited without prompting  then I'll be very reluctant to go

I mean I feel like it's not worth getting mad at her for jt since she's not your girlfriend  Who knows why she didn't feel comfortable telling you but she didn't  I'd rather just keep an arms length distance and understand she's not always truthful and maybe one day you'll realize why she did that  And maybe you can protect yourself  But I don't feel like it's worth anything to try and find out why actively 
Why  Why do you two feel that you have to come 
Yes  an exhaustive search has only turned up more proof   If you say "I hate dogshit  because it disgusts me" this cannot be disproved  and no antidepressant will make it appealing to you  Extrapolate this to every aspect of life  You're not "hoping to like dogshit in the future"  Each time someone attempts to convince you "but dogshit is GOOOD"  just reinforces the idea that seeking advice from them is futile 
Hello  Welcome here  You've done great by posting your feelings here  You are welcome to talk about anything here when your SA acts out and you want to vent out  You will always be accepted here  you are safe here     Lets try discussing to get you at ease and comfortable here  you don't have to answer if you don't feel like it    What are you studying in university  I'm studying software engineering and I'm currently doing an internship at a big AAA game company as a gameplay programmer  If you're learning C  just to learn more about other professions  I tip my hat to you  Programming isn't always easy  it has a steep learning curve at first  but it gets easier once you understand the jist  Do you like it   What kind of music are you writing  On what kind of instruments is it supposed to be played  I'm currently learning electric guitar  and it is fun as hell   What games do you play  Are you more of a console or PC gamer  I spend a lot of time gaming too  on PC   Have a great year  Make of 2017 the year you get what you want out of life   
Ah yes  being the observer  I see people having opportunities ill never have  They get to build relationships and have children  They get to have jobs and live life with the money they make  Even if they are not good people and hurt others with their behavior they still get to live more life  And then they take all that they have for granted  So it is   
We have talked about it many times  He understands the fact that I don't like it but he asked me to bear with it once a year  Which I consider reasonable  I live in a country where every holiday means going out all the time  I just need the courage to do it

I keep telling myself this whenever I start romanticizing about how it might be nice to get into a relationship lol
I understand how ERP can be done for compulsion  I can do that  But I couldn't understand how to do ERP with intrusive thoughts which don't lead to compulsions but just keep on repeating themselves  Any suggestion 
Sometimes  I wonder if I'm a list cause  My life is great or whatever  I just don't like myself  Maybe I won't be able to exercise or successfully complete NoFap or even get into a college I want to  Maybe I won't like myself  I guess I have up accept this  
I don't expect my problems to magically go away  I work very hard to try and overcome what I'm dealing with  it's more the symbology of New Years  the representation of a new beginning that I find upsetting  I do go to counseling  it has helped somewhat  but overall I'm not feeling any better  
You're definitely not alone there  It's been a minute since I've been in your shoes  but I totally relate  Growing up my dad would get pissed at me because I felt I always made it worse  Not sure why  but it's what I've done as well  It's tough to go through  but it's possible  Feel free to message me if you wanna talk through it need any extra support  The journey is so much easier when we all help each other out 
Same  not a single text  I thought I'd get one because I was texting a friend a lot close to midnight  but mid conversation she dropped me  No clue why  
I feel like it gives me an excuse to be okay with being alone so I like it more  but during the day I get more distracted from the thoughts that make the night so terrible  If I could distract myself at night like I do during the day maybe it would be better 
I'm a straight white male and I still want to kill myself  I'm also lonely as fuck    The grass isn't much greener on the other side
I'm always sorry for talking about this   I'm sorry about the fact that people have to deal with me   Because there is nothing interesting about me  
I took it last night  and was still up  tossing and turning  Hoping that tonight it works  I had eaten a lot before taking it  so maybe that affected the results  
I know exactly what you mean  Just practice not reacting  
This is really crappy that all the replies were deleted  I came back to reply to OP who took the time to write back  and I see this happened  Some of us just wanted to reach out to others who were alone last night  to feel less alone ourselves  If we broke some rules here  I'd like to know what we did  Classy move  r depression 
Are you transgendered  If so  I'm sorry for what you're going through  It's tough about there  especially for trans women  
If you're depressed  it can be really hard to do any work  I went from being a 4 0 student to failing my finals over the course of a couple months due to depression  Please try not to blame yourself  It's not a lack of motivation thing  or focus thing  maybe it is  but it's being caused by something out of your control  It's not a personality character flaw  If it were   you wouldn't be on here posting about it 
 black out  lol  nah but seriously man  sex isn't everything  but as a fellow lonely person i feel your pain  if you wanna talk i'm here
Interesting
Thanks for replying   But I'm not going for the job  My father don't allowed me to go  I guess I just have to keep going the rough path       Happy new year to you  
I'm sorry  That's hard to deal with  Just to clarify  you're not hearing actual voices  are you  If you are that doesn't make you crazy  just that you should probably seek treatment ASAP    I hope you feel better  If you ever want to talk to a stranger  I'm here 
It just sucks  I have no idea if I've done anything wrong and everyone just kinda left me in the dust  I really cannot wait to graduate cause I'm trying to look forward and hoping college is much better
I had plans with my family to go watch the new year fireworks  but they invited the neighbors over after supper and cancelled our plans  I tried to hide in the background  was told it was very rude  I tried to fit in and felt very uncomfortable all night  And eventually  I tried to sneak out to see the fireworks without anyone changing my initial plans and assert what I really wanted for me  and I only had an argument with my mother about being alone on NYE just for fireworks  but fuck    they change my plans all the time 
thanks man

Hm  I only really get that way if I do have a mood swing  I have bipolar   Do your ups last for more than one day or is it just the one night  Or has this never happened  If it's a temporary thing  I have no idea  I'm sorry   The closest I've come to that was when I was denying there was  a problem and sort of "overcompensated" sometimes so I could manage to do things like socialize 
How do you mean  Like not giving those thoughts attention  How can I practice that  They're in my head and if I just let those thoughts pass by  there are still hundreds of other negative thoughts that pass by continuously    So any tips are welcome
Please don't take this as an attack  it isn't meant offensively  I'm quite sure I'd be in a similar position myself if my boyfriend broke up with me  Maybe I should listen to my own advice     It sounds as though you're using relationships as a crutch to deal with your own problems  Everyone has to have a crutch to get them through the bad times   religion  food  gaming  people  drink  drugs  again  this isn't an attack  people are also my crutch   Now obviously it's healthier to be reliant on a person rather than something harmful like alcohol food binging  But the problem with relationships is a lot of the time they aren't forever   and that can leave you vulnerable when your crutch is pulled from under you  I would perhaps recommend you find some coping strategies on your own  and get a little space from your partner for a while to ensure that  you can be ok on your own   I had a break from relationships for almost a year and began to rely on friendships instead  which can be a lot more stable   It also sounds like you may be putting too much on your boyfriend  Some people can't deal with mental health problems  and we as people suffering with them  shouldn't inflict anything on others they can't deal with  If you love your boyfriend  of course it would be hard to let him go  However  you should also want him to be happy and what's best for him   If after discussing his needs and your needs  you don't feel like they can be aligned or fulfilled   you may have to accept that at least at this point the relationship cannot continue  Not "never"  just  not now   Ask your boyfriend to write a list of qualities traits about you he thinks are 'you'   and how these change when you take on this new 'personality'  This way  you can focus on particular aspects next time you're in one of these social situations   Finally  even if you don't mean to  it is manipulative to use your suicidal thoughts to stop him from leaving you  If you are in crisis or feeling in any way suicidal  please ring the emergency number in your country or go to your nearest emergency department  Our illnesses can make us selfish but for those we really love the real us can shine through   I really hope you can talk through what needs to be talked through  and work things out  But please try to lessen your reliance on him  for your own sake   exercise  engage in a hobbyist group  join a church buy a Bible  or whatever religion you follow  I often wish I was religious so I could do this    go out with friends   do  something   Best wishes  2017 is  our year  
Happens to me all the time  Almost makes me think I'm just making the whole thing up or something  I just think hey I'm depressed  so I think I'll just lay in bed here all day because that's what depression is right  Even though in reality I think I have he abiliy to at least get some things done  Best method I've tried is to just sort of move on through it  Like if I'm actually too depressed to do anything of course I'm going to just lie around  but if I have at least some energy I might as well try to do  something  with it  Not anything in particular  just anything to keep my mind off the awful sinking feeling and the endless dread  Again  it all depends on how bad the depression is

be aware that they are just thoughts  but you are above them and can disregard them if you want to  with practice this works    Or if you can just put in some headphones in work and don't listen others  Just focus on the music instead     It's like a muscle  Gotta practice  
You could try r legaladvice  but generally speaking the absolutely most important thing you can do is listen to her  support her and believe her   It is likely that when and if she tells people about what happened  they will treat her badly  and it's very important that her good friends counteract that 
Well it's been 9 days since this  and I'm more depressed than ever  I've considered trying to talk to her again  god knows why  and all this situation has brought me is pain  I'm not suicidal  don't have the motivation to be quite yet  but I just want the suffering that is my life to end 
I have underlying depression that I'm currently not treating because I'm 37 weeks pregnant  Add to that the fact that my boyfriend  the love of my life and the father of said baby  was hit by a car and killed 2 months ago  I'm pretty much at the end of my rope   I hope 2017 is better to you all  Unfortunately  I know that if anything this year will be even worse for me  First year without him  Trying to raise a baby alone  Crushing depression  Yay 
I've noticed that I've been "looking" for depression in other people  If I weren't depressed I probably wouldn't be  but aside from that depression has become a meme lately and it desensitizes the issue I think 
I'm not "great" at it by any means but I think you should keep working on it and give it another shot  The feeling of not deserving it is a good example of another negative thought rushing to your mind and I think if you can slowly work on meditating and focusing on your breathing you can better control those things  You won't be perfect at it  the general process for me is "dammit there's a thought" over and over  but doing it imperfectly is still a great relief  This sounds odd but i've found it helps when I have a negative thought  imagine it as a leaf flowing down a river  think to yourself "this is just a thought " and watch it go away  
Welcome     It always amazes me how many of us are out there   I taught for a few years as well and even though I was not in the mental health profession or teaching that subject matter   it still became apparent that my students needed help in that area 
Hey there   It is NOT okay that he did this to you   Being drunk and saying you don't care is not consent   Think about it this way   if you were there with a friend and you talked to them about sex and they were suicidal and said "I don't care"  what would you do   You'd get them a damn blanket and some tea   Not take advantage of them   Is it possible to talk to your boyfriend about this   You should not have to deal with this attacker in your home 
Happy new year   Nope  I didn't make it either lol  I think I fell asleep around 11 00   I am going to visit some family later on today  
Yeah that sounds like rape to me
Just go into therapy  while talking with a psychologist you won't just do ERP  if they have a therapist degree well they must know a lot of therapy types and techniques that  s he will use for you  the one who works the best for you you will keep using 
What is your next goal 
Don't do it  honestly if you're rock bottom it can only get better  There is help for you to get 
Wow man  that's some difficult shit  I have a cousin going through exactly the same situation  Think about it do you want your child to not know who you  better your life for the sake of her  She can't not let you see your child  If you want to talk message me  I'm here dude  I understand how you feel and well 3 weeks ago I tried to kill myself  Life is hard and difficult  you know you can be happy as you said in your post  Message me if you need someone think of your child 
I also get these 'panic attacks without fear'  although they're rare compared to regular panic attacks   Sometimes I can be lying there shaking like a leaf  and suffering chest pain and palpitations  laughing awkwardly and apologising to my boyfriend because I don't really know what's happening   I've found they are dealt with in the same way quite effectively  being held and regulating my breathing 
I feel completely disconnected as well  Personally  I think the reason is that "simple things" are for "simple minds" and are tremendously unfulfilling to the point of disgust  I never feel a single moment of envy  just disgust    If you actually long for the simplicity of bubble baths  there is probably real hope for you  eg  pharmaceuticals 
Im sorry for your lose if you ever need to talk im here

Congratulations  Best of luck for your two year streak 
Thank you for sharing  what about the personal essay was really hard to do 
I hate to be a Debby Downer but that's a lie dude   Some of us wont get better  some of us will just be stuck in the shit for our entire lives   Together we can try to make it just that much better  but some of us will never be truely happy for any substantial length of time again 
I ate healthier basically  More protein foods like chicken and turkey  more salads with low fat dressing 
How did you manage to do it  Were there any tricks that you used  I have a hard time brushing my teeth every day    honestly sometimes  its like 3 or 4 weeks between times    I am trying  I think I have brushed them 3 times in the last week and a half    that is good for me 
I've been considering therapy for a while for my depression  but with all this going on it's probably a good idea to just go for it 
Everyone needs a crutch for their anxiety   whether its something damaging like drink  drugs of binge eating  or something 'safer' like friends  religion and hobbies  I'm glad you found something that helps to take the edge off   and hope you'll use this as a stepping stone rather than a conclusion   I don't want to sound like a nagging mother but for the sake of your health  I would try to find something less damaging you can transition to as a crutch  This could be a slow transition by all means  but I wouldn't want to rely on it in the long term  Best of luck 
Make sure you eat  Taking antibiotics on an empty stomach is a bad idea  What I do if I am on antibiotics is kind of bury it with food  usually oatmeal is my go to  So I would eat about half of the bowl of oatmeal or whatever you choose to eat   take the meds and then finish the food so there's plenty in your stomach  otherwise the antibiotic will irritate your stomach  Good luck  you will be fine  
my friend growing up went through the same thing with being branded an offender minus having the child  and near the very end after a mountain of pills and alcohol  he was filled with regret   he called up his first girlfriend and begged her to help him  but there was no time  he wound up in the hospital with liver failure  he was near death and tried to get help  but no one could help him reverse his decision  it took all of his power over himself away  they had to drop life support  his mother had to choose   and the thing is   2 months before  i had met him for the first time in years  and he seemed right as rain   as another said here  you're at the lowest you can possibly be  if you allow time for things to go on and suffer through every day  in time the only way things can change is for the better 
don't do it  get more selfish 
One thing to try    disrupt your thoughts of stressing over what you said by getting out a piece of paper and writing down every single thing that went right  Every tiny little thing    You have already mentioned some    you actually went out even though you were anxious  you did well in moderating feelings of anxiety while you are at the event  you had a good time while you were there        etc    It sounds like you had some conversations   great  It sounds like you stayed there awhile too   awesome    Make as long of a list as you can of things that went well   Congratulate yourself   this took courage   Good job   
so hard to talk to parents when I feel like shit
My main goal for this year is going to a psychologist and opening up   What about you OP    
Yay   congratulations on your little victory    I met my now long term partner on Tinder  and have a few friends from there too  As an anxious person I found the almost anonymity of it quite relaxing empowering  Try to keep as much personal info off your profile as possible  ie  don't connect your instagram    and you'll feel a lot more anonymous and hopefully a lot less anxious  Best of luck with your search 
get a hobby that requires you to get stuff from outside  Like cooking    or start liking tattoos or piercings  So you'll have to got out and get them  I am a sufferer or anxiety and depression and I have to leave the house to atleast get new piercings   D

Like InanisV said  if you think you're at your lowest how could it get any worse  You can only improve   I lost the love of my life as well  I know things will get better even if it doesn't feel like it now    Your daughter will want her dad growing up  I promise you that  Things may be bad now but give it some time   Time heals and fixes things    You can get through this and your internet stranger friend believes in you    Good luck  
i'm going through the same thing  but i'm 9 years older than you and the relationship was 9 years itself  she was a ball of anxiety  depression  and medical issues that were crippling for her  and incredibly taxing on me when i would try to take care of her  it turned me into a very negative  angry person  i drank a lot  i wound up in the hospital twice for it  i drank with pills and passed out  i smoked so much weed i developed pain in my lungs  it was very unhealthy  we moved across the country for work because i lost my job and she immediately left me for a guy on the other side of the country  she wanted to get fucked by a stallion and by god she got what she was looking for  now i'm fat  older  wasted a shit ton of money on this chick  indebted for it  and i don't know how to date  i can't get anything casual to get it out of my system  either  i think about suicide a lot and everyone that cares about me should be thankful i'm getting through my shit because i'm so very disinterested in living my life anymore  yet i go through the motions and continue to wait for something to happen  at the end of the day  the sun's coming up tomorrow  so i should  too 
It takes a very long time to learn about ourselves  what you're feeling is normal  Yes  in time    good luck
I don't know what I am  I just know that even surgery wouldn't give me what I want  But thanks for your words 
Aha good  Well if in doubt I'm on Reddit   
Yea  right before bed is my scariest time  Somehow submitting to the loss of control that is sleep is terrifying 
Thank you for asking    I've been giving this a lot of thought over the past few weeks leading up to 2017   I help people overcome social anxiety  so my goal this year is to help as many people as I can achieve real change in their lives  I know what works but figuring out the most effective ways to share this with people who need it in a way that they will believe in and actually try can be a challenge   
Everyday I feel this way  I'm so tired of it  I should be celebrating the start of a new year  but its only a new wave of crap coming my way  All I've done so far was shut down all social media and write letters to people I thought were friends telling them that this has nothing to do with them  I feel like they're all fake liars and then basically moved on while I've been stagnant believing in dreams that have a snowball chance in hell of ever being anything   The worst part is that I'm so much of a coward that I can't even kill my self  I've set out clothes and clippers to shave my head so that I look more like a black man and have decided to go to a police officer with a gun or knife  haven't decided which yet  maybe both so the cop feels better for their actions  and have them take care of the killing part    Even admitting this I feel like a piece of shit  the absolute proof that I'm incapable of accomplishing any task i put my mind to  But if I don't do it  I'm like a shell watching the world at a distance never belonging wishing that I could be even if its for a few minutes  It sometimes feels that I'm already dead and my shade is watching the world and interacting on my behalf   I don't know why I put all that in when all I wanted to do was say  " OMG  I feel like this everyday " Then again  I've given you proof about how stupid and selfish I am  
Your family and friends support you  try to ask them for help  and show them you're depressed if they don't know you are 
I was super alone on NYE too  I felt a bit weird and sentimental st times but otherwise it was perfectly fine  
Not the only one that's fur sure  that's the reason why I came on here babe  there's a lot of people that feel the same  just remember to keep going  a friend of my once said "if something leaves you you don't need it anymore  " I start to believe that more and more  it just gets lonely and hard to believe there's anyone out there  so beg here I am searching  pcc   
Yep  I would have done the same thing until that was confirmed  Have a great day   Happy new year    And always remember your hygiene that'll help protect you from all sickness    
Life sucks  dude   I'm sorry about her  Hopefully one day we'll find someone to fill this huge never ending void they left in our hearts
It seems that she played me  She's blocked me on everything and hasn't responded to any of my messages  I'm just heartbroken  I really though we had something 
Exactly my thoughts   I'm dreading it so much I've come up with a plan to avoid it and the years to come 
Sounds like you're off to a really good start  Well done on the weight loss   The critical voice is irrational  so what I I'd was counter it with rational thoughts  It gets easier over time   I'm making good progress   bolted from my job in communications to a Master's programme abroad to sort myself out  It's an expensive but effective solution   For what it's worth  keep up the good work 
Assuming like most of us  you don't have any reason to fear imminent death  and that this is just a general long term concern     yes  the concept of not existing is extremely terrifying to me  Somehow  many people especially as they get older come to peace with this    maybe they're just tired from life  or their religion gives them promises of afterlife  For the rest of us  I think we just willfully and naively ignore the looming tragic reality of death   otherwise we could not even get through the day  not function at all  because we'd know that this is all just hopeless    I also sometimes get that overwhelming feeling of insignificance  Usually it comes for me on long distance flights  in the middle of the night when everyone else is asleep  and we're flying over uninhabited ocean or the arctic  hours from any human civilization  
Writing has always made me anxious tbh  I don't know why it's so hard for me to get started  Also because I'm not sure why I picked that program or major and how to get it into words 
Hey  Don't worry at all about vomiting from antibiotics  I hate taking them because no matter what with an empty stomach or full stomach I always get diarrhea from it but that's just me  I have a sensitive stomach  My words of advice  IF you get diarrhea  REMEMBER it is from the antibiotics because they kill the good bacteria as well  if you do get it  it will have NO correlation to stomach virus or throwing up  You will be absolutely 100  fine 
Well that's something   cats are nice  Although I usually hear dogs are better at improving moods haha  
Hey man  Wanna talk on messenger or iMessage    Also suffer a lot and wouldn't mind someone to talk to  Cheers
I agree I have the same problem  Night time was worse for me and that's what prompted me to go on medication for my anxiety  What caused such an issue with medication  Maybe sit down and tell them the extent of your anxiety  I would be a zombie and never sleep without mine  It's your body  your decision  I'm sure they'd want you to be happy rather than miserable  
 I gave up alcohol  reduced caffeine  reduced fried food  reduced spicy food  reduced dessert  But I also tried to up my caloric intake because I was losing more weight than I wanted to  And I tried eating high protein breakfast  like eggs or yogurt  to give me a boost before work  Anyway none of this seemed to have any effect on my health anxiety  
Depression
I sorta understand where you are coming from  i sometimes do that from time to time  but never really truly follow through  i would sometimes show interest but it will just dwindle away  I guess in a sense  i still don't really know how to make friends  Its weird how it is  if the person i talk to just click  it makes it a lot easier for me to become friends with them  But i know that the older i get the less these things will happen and i would have to work at it to make friends  which i feel its a pain in the ass to do haha  But i really do appreciate how you took your time to share your experiences and advice with me  it really means a lot to me 
That's really  really kind of you  You're a great person for helping people with social anxiety  I honestly thought people like you wouldn't exist anymore in this society  Anyways  I hope you'll reach your goals  thank you    
I would be  because blood levels can go up and down by quite a lot  and lithium can do a lot of damage to your body  But you need to make your own risk assessment  
I have spent the last 6 New Years home alone with my family  and it's honestly the best  NYE celebrations are overrated and recovery is most important  Putting pressure on yourself to go out or feel that you're missing out just makes it worse  I'm so glad you didn't have anxiety about it this year  It's totally ok to spend New Years alone  It really is just another day  
Wow  this sounds very professional  Everything in this song is so true  and I'm sure everyone on this sub can identify with it  Thank you for this wonderful piece of art 
Which medication helped you  My doctors haven't suggested anything specific yet and I'm kind of nervous to go on any meds   
I don't think I really came out on top after all of this  that has yet to happen  I will continue to persevere after many failed attempts    I think that the people who are at the bottom will struggle a lot more to get to the middle or around there and struggle more to stay there  but will maybe have it easier to get to high levels  P S Now I am sure my parents aren't actually depressed because of me
I have the same thing  if i brush my teeth that means I'm feeling at least slightly hopeful  But I have genetically awful teeth so most of the time I feel like there's no point because no matter how much I brush they are just gonna detiororate by the time I'm 50 I'll need dentures
Changing is temporary    Your true self comes out and destroys everything eventually  I have no friends  not real ones  not anyone who would just sit here so I wouldn't be alone planning my suicide    No one ever stays  They always leave and and then belittle you for not realizing they're abandoning you  People who claim their friends are liars and cheats   they use you to make themselves feel better until someone else comes along to replace you   But if you're a good person and true friend  they would understand but they never do  Seasons change and so called friends change just as often   they start families and forget you were ever there  Fuck them 
i am a straight white dude and i am lonely     i hope things get better for you OP  
Thanks  I really appreciate the kind words   If I may ask  though  how long did it take for the world to become kinder   I'm in my second year of college and it's just as bad as high school 
Did your family also get damaged by the communist system  Also is it south east Europe 
My boyfriend knows everything about how I feel and am  and he chooses to be with me and love me regardless  I've also talked to therapist before  a couple different ones actually  but nothing ever came of it  It's more awkward than anything  
Thanks
I don't know you or your life situation  but I really hope you have someone you can talk to about this  and if not I would like to reach out and talk   Life is really hard sometimes  and I can't imagine what you're feeling  but please know there are people out there who want to help  
Anxiety is a bitch  my last job lasted about 8 days before I left  I just couldn't get myself to deal with all the stress  But there's hope  I'm going to see my doctor this week to see what can be done  Have you tried getting help therapy 
So is it late too get into the school 
I drink like a fish  
I wish I knew how to get help for this  Maybe talking about it with someone  maybe not ignoring it  maybe familiarizing ourselves with it more  Though I'm afraid that understanding the reality of it would actually trigger more anxiety  I wonder if sometimes being in denial actually protects us from anxiety  
I missed the application deadline  I'm planning to taking a gap year and reapply for 2018  Just not sure what to do for the next year 
Absolutely  I do this as well  It's like I become a masochist when depressed  and I don't want to do anything because that's how it should be when I'm depressed  Void and vacant 
Thank you  There are many awesome people on this forum  I'm glad to hear you are taking steps to achieve your goals    hope you keep us informed about your progress  Very best of luck in the new year
Thank you  It's comforting to know someone feels the same way  Flying is one of my triggers too   I usually try to calm down eventually  but sometimes this fear also manifests in complete obsession about death  Whenever there's a massive incident involving a lot of deaths  plane crashes for example   I'll spend hours and hours trawling through live feeds to read about morbid details  It's really sick       Edit  Ahh sorry still new to reddit so I deleted my comment by accident 
Ah ok at least you have some time to think about it  Good luck dude  also try not ignoring your mum  it probably hurts her feelings   
Yo dude PM'd you if you wanna talk I understand everything you're saying and experiencing 
It is not your fault that they are miserable  I'm sure it's very hard to live in that situation   unfortunately I don't have very good advices cause I ended up not visiting home for many many years after I was able to move out  But I also saw therapist which was a great help for me  Hang in there  i hope you find the answers you need  
I do try to talk to my partner about it but he's one of Those "rational thinkers" that see it as normal part of life  and I'll get the "It's still far away so just live a good life" pep talk  Which isn't comforting at all when you're freaking out    I was thinking about seeing a psychologist   psychiatrist about it as well  although I feel kinda stupid going for something so minor when there's other people out there who have bigger problems than an existential crisis 
Keep it up and stay strong   I think it's an easy way for us to punish ourselves   neglecting ourselves physically    You're valuing yourself and that's amazing  
Still  it is discouraging that 60  of my work will probably be towards hitting the level that some privileged people got a head start on top of
Lmao this is actually the reason I'm so depressed this morning  All I want is someone to spend New Years with and kiss me at 12 but I guess that's just too much to ask for  Last New Years my girlfriend at the time refused to come and spend time with me  It actually pretty much foreshadowed how the rest of that fucking year would go  Good riddance  2016 
I need help  Got so much problems going on  I know it will soon be ok  but i need help  thats why i made this account just now to share all this burdens  How can i survive  when even the person im looking up to is never with me  How can i do this on my own

You can outgrow it  When I was in high school the mere mention of the symptoms of any disease would give me panic attacks and I threw up on more than one occasion from worrying about illnesses I'd convinced myself I had   Now  I occasionally find myself worrying about something because I do have certain mild health problems that aren't identified  but it's just usually a passing thought and not something that I dwell on or panic over    One thing that helped me was treating my anxiety in general  I quit smoking  I quit drinking caffeine  I cut way back on drinking  started exercising again  and I eat much healthier now  These aren't cure alls  but I found the combination lowered my anxiety dramatically and helped me approach things more clearly  I also tried some medications that I didn't end up liking  but that can be an important part of getting better too that's worth trying  Of course if you can afford it therapy is also a great resource  but the above are things you can do immediately that can have a noticeable impact   I wish you luck in overcoming your health anxiety  and just remember that it IS possible  You don't have to suffer from this your whole life   
yes they know i'm depressed but they don't know why  I understand it's hard for them too because they don't really know how i'm feeling  I just want them to be there when i need it  I love them so much  the last thing i want to do is hurt them that's why i keep on going and try get better 
   don't neglect your teeth of all things  that shit wont heal    listen to this man  not just cause he's chuck norris  Last week I bit down on a fork too hard and chipped a tooth  It's a fairly small crack on my front tooth but it's noticeable close up and it is sharp enough to cause pain when my tongue runs over it  I had a "come to jeebus" moment when I remembered this is my only set of teeth  No more baby teeth to fall back on
Getting on my bike before noon for the first time in a long time today  HNY EOODs 
thanks i really appreciate
You're not alone  We're right there with you
 would have at least been an answer  It is entirely fucked up  I fully recognize that  Yeah I know  I'm an asshole for wishing that upon myself  as I stated in the OP   It is more so to have an answer to what the fuck is going on    If I could take your cancer from you  I would  You should stick around 
Do you have any advice on how to deal with haters on youtube  My yotube career has been shut down 2 times because of hate from people who can't stand seeing someone else go from 0 to success and because of some of them even creating multiple accounts to dislike  Also  if being confident when depressed isn't realistic and I can't control genetics  do I just have to wait until my voice deepens so I can get back to youtube 
Since there was an Askreddit thread about this not too long ago   I gotchu   http   imgur com a wzsQm    The one with the tape on my fingers was taken during finals week to help stop me pulling my hair out lol 
Yay that's great  I really need to start brushing my hair every day  It's basically just a ball of knots on top of my head 
Umm I wish I could say yes  but being social really just feels unnatural  Kinda like I'm pretending to be something I'm not  So I just accept that I'm a loner  I still have friends just not that many 
Hi  Thank you so much for your response and kind advice  I really appreciate it and it's very helpful    I have tried little bits of yoga exercise and meditation  and you're right that when I tried them that it seemed to help a bit   I think I will try doing these things again with more regularity and consistency  I think I give up on them and get frustrated for some reason but will persevere    I will also keep the medication advice in mind too    thank you again for your response and for sharing your experience with anxiety and losing temper  I appreciate knowing I'm not the only one who struggles with this  
The ol'  good shadowing 
   thanks man  Thanks for reading  always helps to be listened to  I like your username too btw 
A better attitude is to be thankful to them instead of sorry for you  What do you do to entertain yourself  
I used to think 'i don't want to commit suicide  but I'd be fine with not waking up tomorrow so at least that way it's no one's fault that I died ' it's a permanent answer to a temporary problem   I say temporary because you can get help for these thoughts  I don't know where you are  but I'm the UK and I phoned a free crisis helpline and spoke to someone who has anxiety and they told me what they do to cope  and worked through ways of what I can do to distract myself from these thoughts  They also connected me with some more long term help  CBT  and it's a long road  but I no longer have these thoughts  That was about rambly but hope it helped even a tiny bit 
Wow I relate to this so much 
I don't know how to thank you very much for your words  it hurts  like the truth does  but the reality is that at this moment take distance is a good strategy at this moment  you gave me wonderful ideas and a way to afront this along with the therapy  Thank you very much
Excuse my presumption here  but how   Who are you   Why are you collecting information   If you're as professional as you say  why are you using a free surveymonkey survey   Why didn't you bother to correct spelling errors before posting   This feels super suspicious and skeevy   Responders beware   Edit  OP   This is the place  https   www reddit com r ptsd comments 55d6x1 survey thread surveys posted outside this thread  st IXEZ91E3 sh 2d672a23  you are supposed to post surveys along with  info about who you are  
This is exactly what I felt  in my post only yesterday   https   www reddit com r depression comments 5lb2hh have so much but dont want any of it    Yeah  some shitty stuff may have happened to us  but there are so many others who've had so much worse happen and they turn out fine  Then there's people like us who have so much to be thankful for but no enjoyment of any of it   All I can say to you  and i guess for myself as well  is that you are what you feel  There's no way of hiding you feelings to yourself  and those emotions are what will eventually find their way out to your being  If you feel like you're depressed  just admit to yourself that you are  Force yourself to go see a therapist  even if it's just once  Seeing one doesn't necessarily lead to anti depressants or other drugs  so you'll at least have the chance to say that your depression isn't as bad as some other people's  
Freaking awesome  man   This is how it starts for you  It's only going to get easier and better to post from here  Then on to more exposure  It's wicked uncomfortable  and even terrifying  Way to be brave  Ride this wave of support onto the next and keep killin' it  Happy new year 
I don't wanna look like Agent 47   
if you're gonna kill yourself which you shouldn't  at least do it the normal ways  Don't ruin some random guys day by making him shoot you  what the hell man 
  Often when I go out for a walk  I look at the people around me and feel completely isolated and alone  even more so than when I'm actually alone   Oh yes  that was me half a year ago  it was the most unbelievable  almost unreal feeling of isolation I've ever had    I was taking a walk  watching all these people having fun together  riding bikes  laughing  families together and all that stuff while I can't even fucking maintain a simple friendship because something is obviously wrong with me  somewhere deep inside    Like I shouldn't belong to human kind because I'm somehow unable to handle the most basic things that are normal and natural to every other human being   There are 2 levels of isolation   1st one where you just don't care and feel neutral about it  and the deeper  darker 2nd one  where you literally feel like a fucking alien sent on Earth   
I'm sorry bud  Loneliness sucks no matter who you are 
I really appreciate this comment  I'm basically in the same boat as you  It's nice to hear that I'm not alone in how I feel 
Feel you buddy  only 20 hours in to 2017 and shit's already happening  even though i'd rank 2016 as the worst year of my life i've a feeling this is gonna be worse   
that dogshit example was neat
Why not try a different approach  well what is dogshit to begain with  it's got nutrients and vitamins and bacteria  It works with the digestive system of the dog  So a good piece means the dog is healthy    Now try to understand depression  It makes you wanna do nothing all day and things like that  But have you ever been depressed and someone  like your grandma or boss  calls and that forces you to be on your best behavior and for a minute you're not depressed anymore  Well that's means its a state of mind  Perhaps going outside and forcing yourself to deal with not people like that could provide you with a deterrence for the state of mind that is depression    There are different kinds of depressions so this example might not work for you but you get my point  
Same I don't want school
Even the most popular Youtubers have haters  The competition out there is fierce too  If that is something enjoy doing though  just do it  You won't get better without a ton of practice    I also post my artwork on Reddit and it's not always well received  But just remember  most people don't even contribute to the internet  they just lurk and comment behind anonymity  Keep at it
I take Effexor but the medication that helps me at night is called remeron  it calms and causes sleepiness  
Me too  
About 22 and I'd I am just going to keep my head up and keep walking for now 
Nice  what are you learning  
I also take klonopin at night as well
Hugs to you OP  I see you  I would also tell you that you are not alone  Heck  99 of the people on the planet could disappear and no one would give a shit relatively speaking  It is a new year  This is not to say things will be awesome in an instant but it is a starting point  Take up a physical hobby  The endorphins you get from the exercise are very beneficial and help clear the mind  I'm pulling for you 
I think the phrase intrusive thoughts can help you here  Simply put  they are intrusive  unwanted  and thoughts  not actions   I had a very bad episode of anxiety and panic attacks months ago that had me fearing going near knives in fear is hurt someone including my kids  It was extremely unsettling  I also  around this time  visualized myself walking right into traffic  I absolutely love living and have a decent life  but these thoughts just came   Id say if they continue for more then a few months  seek professional help  There is nothing wrong with talking to someone  As a veteran of a war  pride aside  it's healthy to be open  When you normalize your situation  it becomes very easy to live with it    Be well 
Try 21 years for me   I'm 33  
Totally don't care for the new year  I can't see much changing in my life and my current situation is unsustainable 
Lol when the fear of leaving is this immense  no hobby will make a person leave   Speaking of piercings  I pierced my own nose  properly and with a real hollow piercing needle  years ago while having a panic attack  I almost fainted but it was some strange temporary distraction 
Well  I did complete opposite this time  Last new year's eve  I stayed home alone playing video games and it was one of my best NYE's ever  This time I went to a friend's party  I didn't really want to go but went anyway  I didn't feel comfortable at all  All the drunk "happy" people dancing  trying to make me dance also    I felt soo big relief when I left the party  On one hand I'm glad I went because I left my comfortable space but on the other hand I didn't enjoy myself  
Keep reading  Keep learning  Try new things  Follow what you like doing  Keep an open mind   You're young with a lot of life ahead  I'm 27 and still can't answer those questions  but I have learned a ton from the decisions I have made   Keep living 
Buspar IMO sucks and not even worth filling the prescription  Propranolol is def better but  also comes with possible side effects  In a nutshell propranolol physically stops you from having a panic attack but  mentally   any intrusive thoughts will still be there  If you suffer from anxiety but mainly suffer with physical symptoms racing heart  hyperventilating  etc  then I would def recommend it  If you suffer mentally as well   a different medication would be a better option  
I'm in the same boat  But it depends  how old are you  If you're in college or high school it's much easier than afterwards  
Thank you so much  I know you are right  My title itself should tell me something lol  Sometimes it feels like I just need someone to day it too me  I really appreciate the response thank you 
Same here  It's almost as though you feel like you have to prove that you're depressed  That if you don't have the telltale signs then its not valid  so you try to maintain those symptoms in a way
It helps just knowing there are people who have gotten through it  Thank you   
For some reason  people with long fingernails really bother me  I hate being touched by them  hearing them tap their nails  or seeing them put their nails against paper  They seem so dirty to me because I know germs can get trapped under there  It makes my little sister really self conscious about her fingernails 
Sorry to hear  There sure is someone who is the one for you  Don't lose hope  I hope too  
If you're hallucinating  do you think it's more than OCD  
Seriously what the fuck 
Theres a positive and negative side to everything  neither of them are more true than the other
We want the positive things but when we have them we are not grateful  It's a circle  I'm not even sure to know what I want  
Money and jewelry  I physically shudder when I have no option but to touch those  Edit   And fake finger nails   
I'm aware that the law in my state is  or used to be  a 72 hour buyer's remorse period  and most dealers don't want consumers to know about it   It's a massive hassle and the car can't be resold as new so the dealership takes a loss and I believe the buyer forfeits his deposit   I've genuinely thought about it   But ultimately it's not that bad a decision   I do need a car  and I'm not sure I would have found anything more suitable without spending a lot more 
Downvote me if you want  but I went to  all and sorted by new and your post came directly after a post in r TenYearsAgoOnReddit and I thought "Ten years    I wonder what I'll be like when my reddit account is ten years old "  See you in ten years  OP 
I love this post   Good attitude   I find it so interesting that you have a background in mental health but really didn't realize that you yourself had BP   Similar for us   All the signs were there that my wife had BP  but we didn't spot it till a professional told her she had it   Also  you are so right to say that it's not some sort of "bad" thing that you have BP   Us humans are flawed creatures   Many of have us have some form of chronic illness  yours just happens to be bipolar   it's no different than someone else that has diabetes  MS  Parkinson's or whatever 
I like this 
I want t sharpen a pencil and stab them in their eye sockets  my hands are shaking for no reason  I don't think anyone really cares about my problems  I lied about having a girlfriend and a first kiss to my parents so they don't think I'm weird  I don't know why everyone thinks getting a girlfriend is required  All the girls I have been around just do it for social reason or to get gifted some fucking shoes  I feel like like a burden and I'm sorry for whoever is using their time to read about my problems   I don't know what to do  I'm too lazy to revise which is my fault  I keep telling myself all these people who treat me like shit will get what's coming but do I really believe that  sometimes I want to just snap and stop taking their bullshit  But then I convince myself that getting punished and excluded for hurting them will mean they won  I'm such a loser lol  Why do I care if their parents can afford better trainers than mine    
The fact that you snapchatted your boobs and flirted doesn't matter  at all  when it comes to the seriousness and legitimacy of him sexually assaulting you  Whether you report it is entirely your decision  it can be very positive or very negative for people  so it's important that you make that decision on your own   If you're comfortable doing so then talking to your guidance counsellor and or philosophy teacher could be beneficial  it can help talking to someone that you trust    Your are not to blame in any way  You are not dirty  Someone did something horrible to you and the blame is entirely on him 
Not the worst but bad
Lmao I got no idea either 
I lost all my friends from high school too  I used to be social and happy but now i have basically no one and am just self absorbed and withdrawn most days  I hope you can stay positive  I want to think there is a brighter future out there 
You're right   I can afford it     I am just mad at myself for lacking the discipline to stick with the original plan   The VA actually threw a monkey wrench into the works by increasing my disability rating  they gave me an extra  600 a month   I should be using that as a gift and an opportunity to invest in my business and accelerate my debt repayment   Instead I basically spent it all on a car  between the payment  around 450  and insurance  around 100      I'm actually still a LOT better off in my monthly budget than I was just a few months ago   Even if the VA change hadn't happened  this cumulative set of transactions shaved around  250 off my monthly bills which I will put toward straightening out other financial problems   But I could have had even more to work with if I'd had the patience and even courage to drive a beater car  or two  for a year or so 
Thank you  Same to you  I already have 2 kids with him and I can safely say his sociopathic nature was definitely learned  It all depends on how the child is raised  My kids are exceptionally well behaved and intelligent  while his kids with multiple other women are not  because their mothers were either absent or just as bad as him  It does suck to look at a kid and see the face of someone you hate  but I learned its something you need to tolerate as a mom  just like one of my kids has a big birthmark on her face  You don't love your kids based on how cute they are unless youre a jerk  so who their father is is on you not them  Thank you for not being judgmental about me having another baby because its nice to know not everyone values a babysit right to life based on how much money their mom has 
I feel like we are in the same boat  Im starting to notice that whenever im not stimulated these clouds of negative toughts starts to appear  And whenever i start to go into these clouds stories i make them escalate and i get depressed and the angst takes over  When i get this angst im a different person  My emotions is negative and my subconcious toughts  however i spell it  are negative  The only thing im working for in my life right now is to find some peace  Enough about me  What i want to say to you is continue to stay strong my friend  Life is weird and everyone has their own way  You are a fucking warrior that keeps going everyday even tho your body and head is not on your team  I love you and i feel for you  Seek some help if you get worse  you have nothing to lose 
If it makes you feel better I didn't either  just watched movies and played video games til 11 59 then watched the ball dropped and then proceeded to continue my stuff

Yeah thanks man  Been getting some help over the past few months and it's been meh   
It isn't really psychopathic  I'm just constantly on edge   No pun intended  I'm sorry it was just a bad day and i wanted to share my thoughts  I don't really feel like i need any help  i'm just young and my head is unbalanced it'll go away  
In college and on winter break currently  It's just that I've hung out with those people for a looonng time and haven't been meeting new people since and I feel like everyone already established their own circle of close friends so it would be weird difficult for me to include myself into their plans 
I'm the same way  I'm pretty self sufficient and need very little input from people  but it had helped with my issues  We can surely get lost in our own head 
Thanks  by the way  what is TOCD 
i've always thought i was the only one  I've seen so many things on this subreddit that i can strongly relate to but i still never expected for something like this to come up   on topic  it really helps me to learn stuff  by repeating it untill i completely understand something makes it easyer to remember stuff  but sometimes it can be really frustrating because i can't get myself to stop repeating something  I still see it as a positive aspect of my OCD though 
Oh wow I didn't know that thank you for the heads up  Will be careful when recommending that in the future 
Yeah often times bad things override the good things in my life and I'm not sure how to deal with it  Last year around this time I was in the greatest relationship I ever had  but things went south when she moved away and stopped being in touch with me  Made me want to KMS  Now all I remember and can feel is that pain I felt at the end  There are small glimpses I get of the good experiences I had with her  but I can only really remember the bad  It's like my default state is feeling bad and sometimes I feel good 
I love the aggression man  You don't need a girl  you want a girl  You don't have to do anything
Hooray 
I am dark skinned asian  Basically among the most unsought after and undesired group for relationships regardless of anything like orientation  Anything else has a better chance than what I am   
This is a problem for me across the board  feeling like my emotions aren't genuine unless I behave like the very picture of that emotion  When it comes to depression though  I try to remind myself that I'm getting up and doing "non depressed" things  despite  how real the depression is  because I have been here before and come out the other side before  because therapy and soul searching and trial and error through those experiences let me develop enough tools and strategies to let me keep tighter hold on the reins of my life when my brain spins everything out of control  Any degree to which I'm not completely powerless to my depression isn't evidence that it's not real  it's a sign of how far I've come  When I can overpower or outsmart this force that tries to keep me paralyzed  it means I'm winning  and that victory is hard fought and well earned  
Lol  I didn't even watch the ball drop  I've lost interest in it  I used to watch it as a kid but it's the same every year and repetitive to me  nothing special  I just read my book and listened to music as I've been doing every night    no need to celebrate as it's a day like any other to me
What's there to celebrate  same day as anything else
Edit  If you want a fun read about threatened male sexuality you may look through  these comments   https   www reddit com r pics comments 5l9w24 not sure where to post my cousins job just asked dbu11b6  
i know  I got some help aswell for a good time  Didnt help me that much  ive been isolated back and fourth for about 5 years now  2 suecide attempts  I had issues with myself since i was really young  Im 23 years old now  Still suffer from severe angst and depression  But im at this point where im really motivated to get trough this hell  And i know how you feel right now  ITS FUCKING TERRIBLE  D This is why i could never be a shrink because i really dont know what to say to people who suffer from depression and stuff  I just know for myself that it will get better with time and positive actions  Im here for you buddy 
What i'm trying to say is style matters allot if you dress well it shouldn't be a issue  But if truly hate it there is an option get one of those proffesional wig's and people won't even know your bald  I knew a women who got bald and she had one and I never noticed it even after I heard it was a wig I still couldn't see it's fake 
Find some friends
What about a family  When you're already old  it'd be nice if there were people who'd be thankful for you being their parent  taking care of you  helping out   
One of the worst feelings I know is posting something and then getting no reaction  You make an effort  thinking you've contributed to the discourse  or whatever  and then nothing     So  I just wanted to take a moment and say that I agree with your sentiment  that feeling guilty over being depressed is weird feeling 
happy new year  it's a brisk but sunny day here in New York City  and I'm actually about to go walk the 3 miles  roundtrip  to Target to return some workout gear I got for Christmas   running pants that are just a bit too long   best wishes to all on your progress  2016 was a ridiculous year for me   divorce  new job  finally sorting out all my shit with a therapist  getting my body in much healthier shape  dropped 15 pounds and improved muscle definition   and more   but I'm looking forward to 2017 
Agreed 100   All it is is a change in numbers honestly 
same OP  I just watch as everyone has fun socializing and having fun  enjoying each other's company   meanwhile I'm alone and bitter  I hate the pain and risk that comes with "putting yourself out there" but I hate the pain of isolation as well  No idea which one I prefer 
I just finished reading Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari and it goes in to this a little bit
"look at dogshit from a different angle"  is this correct 
I got lucky  a few family members  grandmother and sisters texted me happy new year 
I do that too  I like it because if I get toothpaste all over the place or all over  me  I can just wash it away  
It did  thank you  I was lucky enough to avoid huge crowds besides being in the nightclub but I found a spot right under the air conditioner so that kept me sane lol 
Wait  what's ERP  I'm knew to the Reddit and the OCD subreddit so I'm still learning lots of terms 
I don't know if this can work for you  but humor me   You say you feel like you "have" to do things that a depressed person would do during depression   Usually those seem to be "negative" things that reinforce or validate the depression   What if you convince yourself to do "positive" things a depressed person might do   For example  force yourself to do one good thing for yourself  Even if it's a tiny little thing like brushing your teeth or doing laundry   After you do it  give yourself a huge pat on the back   you deserve it   Another excellent one that I recommend is going out in the sunlight in the morning for 30 45 minutes  You don't have to leave home even  just go out on your porch  balcony or backyard 
Don't give up just yet  Keep trying  there is a solution to your problems 
I don't think so  I have a very vivid visual imagination as it is  I think this is just my worries coming into that 
thank
Yessir break it apart find the biology and chemistry in it and understand it just like when the proctilogist does the colonoscopy without giggling  Same with depression learn some psychology and understand whats really going on  
while I had a rather nice new year's eve  even made a friend  after a very insightful and "important" conversation while we were really drunk  today the bad thoughts start to come through again   I'm feeling so anxious inside  The girl I really like also hit on me  I think    but as always I was to shy to make any sort of move      BUT I got out of my bubble at that party more than usual  Meeting new people conversation with other's is usually something I really struggle with  which is at least something      But I still feel so shit right now  and it's not being hungover  
So are you actually seeing things or is it your brain trying to convince you you're seeing things even though you don't visually see it 
this is why I smoke meth  Well kinda 
My first suggestion would be to stop comparing yourself with others  We can only play the hand we're dealt  and many here have been dealt a raw deal  Don't make yourself feel even worse for your bad luck   start asking yourself how you can improve your situation and do it  Being alone is tough but there is still one person who cares and who can make your life better  you  
first of all it sounds like you are fortunate that your bp isn't severely debilitating  if you can hold a job or go pass college classes youre doing a lot better than a lot of people on this forum   If you think you can't handle the upcoming semester  take a break   Also there are disability help centers on campus to help with deadlines and tests and getting you on a study schedule   2nd don't be afraid to ask for help  and communicate with your fiance   If he doesn't know whats going on  he'll just think you suck   Don't be afraid to take large amounts of time off to work on yourself   I two years of my life  my marriage  two jobs  and failed out of school due to avoiding my problems and my inability to ask for help   but other people have lost more and more time   If you have an understanding SO your already ahead of the game  and make sure to listen to him when he notices something "off" about you   I am awful at knowing how i feel and usually didnt notice that i was depressed  anxious  irritable  for long stretches of time until the mood passed  and since your SO is around the most hell be able to tell when your mood shifts   Most importantly imo BP does not allow you to prioritize anything before it   You have to come first  it sucks but you arent helping anyone if you cant manage your symptoms or if you are in the hospital   Good luck  this forum is awesome for finding other people with your same issues and can be very comforting 
What do you aim to do to occupy your time 
Thank you for sharing  soundslike a great routine  
That's cool  I work image and video processing and optimization  what are the topics that you mostly handle  I've wanted to learn WebGL  but I was deep in the hole 
I wish I had an answer for you  But you do have my sympathy  My boyfriend is the same way  His friends are all the people we went to high school with  Mostly people I didn't get along with or didn't know  They're pretty crude and just moronic  Even he has said he wants to move on and get new friends but still he sees them and wants me to see them too  I know how you feel  
whats the root of the problem  med compliance is only the symptom   do you not accept your diagnosis   do the drugs mess you up  or do you just forget   a pill box or setting a reminder on your phone might help but only if you want to be on the meds   also sometimes it takes the right cocktail   I got frustrated on my last round of meds and stopped taking them too  but eventually I went back to my p doc because i wasnt getting better  but i wanted to   
Hey  just wanted to chime in and say that I'm going through something similar  I was recently promoted to front desk manager at the hotel I work at and I'm absolutely cracking under the pressure  I'm not even functioning as well as I was before I was promoted  The only way I've been able to manage is by saying "fuck it" occasionally and ignoring my responsibilities  but I would not recommend this as it just makes everything harder in the long run   I really want to quit  but I too am friends with management and don't want to let them down  I'm particularly close with the person I directly report to and she stuck her neck out for me to get this position in the first place  I think that they like me enough to protect me for a while  but I don't think I have it in me to do this job the way it should be done   Sorry I don't have any advice for you  but at least we're not alone 
It feels like you're just floating through life  It's a terrible feeling 
My goal is to smile and greet people when I see them at work for 90  of the time 
That sounds like schizophrenia and not OCD or some combination of the two  Idk what psychology your gf and that nurse are studying but it's very different than what I've learned   This is like textbook schizophrenia 
Hallo  I hope you can benefit from your partial hospitalization program like I  and many others I personally know  have benefited from ours    My psychiatrist also prescribed Abilify to add on to my antidepressant  generic of Effexor XR  as an enhancer thingy when I was at my partial hospitalization program  He saved my life when he prescribed it  and that is not an exaggeration  My antidepressant was working really well for me  but then it was losing its effectiveness  in my case  So  Abilify was added  Adding it has made a huge difference in how I feel  and I wouldn't have made anywhere near as much progress without it    As far as side effects go  the only side effect I experienced was increased hunger at higher doses  I'm on five milligrams now  which I believe is a lower dose  so increased hunger hasn't been an issue 
Sorry if it feels that way  But I want those who have PTSD to not be offended 
They are equally killer   But you're right  Not having to pretend    I'll take that 
It's like a biological imperative to be social  even though it's not really what I want  So weird  It always makes me feel worse 
I feel the same way   And it didn't help that everyone I know was able to tell me last night they were with family  And some even had a sec to wish me a happy new year   And here I sit  just as alone as I was then 
But it has a 364 in 365 chance of not being worse   How hopeless that sounds

Dear F4ST M4ST3R  first of all  you are not your sister  As more pressure you put on yourself the harder it gets  What are things which distract you  For a lot of people it is electronics  if so but those away  For me it always helped a lot to write summaries on things I have to learn  Why don't  you set yourself miniature goals with your homework  Example  1 assignment and then 5 sit ups  Like this you get your mini breaks but are "happier" to do the homework because this gives you a break from working out  Just a thought   
Fuck  I really wish I could help you

When the clock hits twelve  life's still shitty 
Thank you very much for your kind and supportive answer  I've read about "toxic shame" as you mentioned and it quite makes sense indeed  I've never taken any meds   I was reluctant to and wanted to be able to manage by myself but I guess I was a little to optimistic or naive  I just wish I didn't have to carry that "burden" anymore  To be clear I had "accepted" it and didnot see it as such while resurrecting but everything feels like an ongoing struggle whose positive results are quite fragile and easily shattered it seems  I'm sorry   it's my exhausted self talking  Hopefully it'll get better and easier  And I will try again and "gather myself around my faith for the light does the darkness most fear" as one of Jewel's song said   I've heard it years go and I don't even remember which it is but it stuck with me   Thank you again for your answer and I wish you a very beautiful  happy and healthy new year strewn with joyful moments and beautiful souls  Hugs 
Thanks    
So by your logic bad things don't just happen we make them happen  I call B S 
I don't actually see things  more like in my mind's eye 
Gratz mate  Brushing your teeth is great  You feel so confident when you look into the mirror with those well kept teeth 
You definitely exist without connections  Rejection is something we all experience  but for some the anxiety associated with the potential of being rejected is too much and we avoid social situations  People will tell you it's in your head and that if you just go out and try  things will be different  but they never are  The problem with social anxiety is that the expectations have been programmed in   the most rational thought cannot overcome the feelings of anxiety  The only way to deal with it is to gradually reprogram yourself out of the anxiety  There is a good approach for dealing with this sort of anxiety and it may be difficult  but it works    https   www verywell com how do i get over my fear of social situations 3024829  I also want to add that it is best to think of this as a disorder that can be fixed  not a fundamental part of who you are  Who you are at any given moment is the sum of your current thoughts and past experiences   if we change our daily experiences and our thoughts  we can gradually change who we are  It just takes time 
My philosophy
Yeah  I was worried it was schizophrenia too  but I don't think it is  The primary problem I'm having is the obsessive thoughts of the world ending followed by checking news to make sure everything is okay  which leads to more thoughts of the world ending    
And I just wanted to ad that I don't know what DBT et CBT are but I'm going to look into it  A year and a half ago I went to a cognitive psychologist but after 4 months we hadn't started with the cognitive therapy yet although I clearly insisted on it and said I no longer wanted to "have to" tell my story again and again  I think it's totally useless and makes you a prisoner of your own past and I don't want that  So I stopped  I guess some psychologists do not understand that you've already had enough with your past and just want to move on and try to manage its consequences to try and build your own life   ie that was stolen from us for a while  
the thing is whenever I "put myself out there" it still doesn't change anything about the connection  Even If I had those hobbies that other people have which I'm envious of I think I still wouldn't feel more like I belong  I would just be the guy who's there and doing the same stuff  I literaly have never gotten to know a single person from going out or going to parties or to the movies  I guess people don't care about me much and don't want to know me
What a shitty preachy post man  no offense  
Have you told anyone about your hallucinations  Because yes  what you just described could be OCD  however  that behavior WITH the hallucinations is schizophrenia not OCD  The hallucinations significantly change the diagnosis  People with OCD have delusions   like believing the world is going to end  but not hallucinations  Schitzophrenia has BOTH hallucinations and delusions  
thank you so so much  I worried so much that my flirting somehow takes away the legitimacy of the assault  thank you  and I think I will go to my teachers when the break is over

Thank you very much for your answer flyonawall  Your analogy is an eye opener   I guess I sometimes demand too much of myself  I think I've accepted what happened and how it affected me but not yet as "an irrevocable part of me"  if it means sometimes being to "paralyzed" to do what I want to do  I guess I need to deal with my current frustration about this  Thank you very much and a very happy and beautiful year to you and your loved ones 
Glad to hear it  I hope your year is filled with lots more laughs  chuckles  tickles  and giggles    
this is good advice I'm going to try it myself  thank you  
Hi  Sorry to hear about your struggles  Give yourself a lot of credit for reaching out and wanting help   I will copy and paste a guide I wrote about how to find a good  affordable therapist in the US  One second  let me find it  I also recommend starting with a primary care physician to get a check up done and a blood test ordered  These things can help rule out any potential causes or factors contributing to the way you're feeling like thyroid issues  hormone imbalances  and vitamin deficiencies  Keep in mind that seeing a doctor doesn't automatically mean you'll need to take psychiatric medication  nothing wrong with that at all though  I'm on psych meds myself    I also mean this respectfully  but would seeing a therapist be an option  as well  A therapist who is a good match for you can provide support  give you a private place to express yourself  give objective feedback on your situation  help you move forward   if you have any questions  like what types of questions you would be asked by a professional  how to prepare for a first appointment  how first appointments usually go  or my personal experiences with professional help   then don't hesitate to ask me  Feel free to send a message anytime  
It's all good man  Sounds like you are still in high school  I am completely failing out of college  I have wasted thousands of dollars  
I've told my GP  occupational health nurse and my counsellor  None of them has suggested schizophrenia  Plus I'm not having 'real' hallucinations  as in actually seeing things   it's more like in my minds eye  I've sort of been able to make things appear in my minds eye whenever I want to as well 
Thank you  It gives new leads and tools to use  Sometimes I just want to live   "free"     Happy new year 
So do I   I remember when I was 17 and had the feeling I was invisible  Today I am 30  and nothing has changed  I am the same  just way more worn out 
In the trashcan    Jk   I mean no offense 
OK  found it  Part 2                                              How to find an affordable therapist in the US     There is a well known website called psychologytoday com that has a therapist finder and psychiatrist finder to locate professionals in the US  Here are the steps    1  Search online for psychologytoday com's therapist finder  Search by your zip code or city  or nearby ones  in the search bar of psychologytoday's search engine thingy    2  If you have insurance  look on the left sidebar to filter your search results by your insurance provider  If you don't have insurance  look at the bottom of this post because I address this    3  Hopefully after selecting your insurance provider  a list of professionals will come up  Each professional's profile should have their picture  what they specialize in  price  contact information like an email address or phone number  etc  The information you'll find in each profile can help you find a professional who is a good match for you  It's a lot more useful than just randomly calling a name from a list  you know what I mean    4  Read through a few profiles and see whom you'd like to work with    5  Go ahead and contact a few therapists through email or by phone  I suggest contacting a few  just in case there is a waiting list  If you need help with what to say  then let me know and I can write up a quick example that you can tweak or use as is        If you have no bad insurance and or are in a tough financial spot      In the US  the key phrases you want to look for are   sliding scale   or   income based    which just mean that the professional will take your financial insurance situation into account and lower the price  People can even qualify for free help  depending on their situation  As far as finding professionals who charge on a sliding scale or provide income based services  remember when I said above to look on the left sidebar after you search by your zip code or city to filter by your insurance provider  Well  you can disregard that part  Instead  what will happen anyway is that after you hit enter when you put in your zip code or city  a list of professionals will come up anyway    Click on any profile and scroll down to the finances section  If it says sliding scale  yes  then you're in luck because the price can be negotiated and should be able to be lowered    Now you know where to look for professionals who charge on a sliding scale  If you have any questions about anything  don't hesitate to ask me  I wrote a lot and some may be unclear  Feel free to ask anything  
I wanna reroll character  Like 10 points into charisma or something 
In my experience  weed is very counter productive  It can reduce the anxiety in the moment  but leads to overthinking things and paranoid thoughts  And it also warps your sense of reality a bit  making things worse  That slightly different perspective is cool in the moment  but if you smoke too much  it can be harmful   I know a lot of people here are giving you a pass on this  but I've been through a similar path you have and in my experience  it's better to deal with things head on  and LEARN to deal with them head on  That will make you stronger in the long run  and allow you to deal with anxiety when it comes back  which it often does   That's also why I'm not a fan of medication for anxiety  Certainly not long term  You're simply silencing the symptoms without dealing with the underlying issue that's causing them in the first place 
propranolol is great  as mentioned above  it prevents physical symptoms but that helps your thinking too  it's far easier for panicky thoughts to overwhelm you if your body is panicking too  it gets me through anxious situations pretty well

Same with me buddy  I've knocked booze on the head  otherwise I'd have died through it  I take my meds  an on the whole  they work   Hope you're ok
Start out by brushing before going to bed 
Proud of ya m8ty  Take that momentum and go onto the next   
I would really like to make some friends at work and go on at least one date before the end of the year 
To OP  if you're trying to help  go fuck yourself  If anyone here wanted this kind of "advice" they would go to church  
Very interesting
So you're not actually seeing blood coming out of doors  
Intrusive thoughts were the worst part about my rough patch of anxiety last year  They really can be terrifying and take many forms  What I learned is that the more you force those thoughts away out of fear  the more you are validating them in your mind  And they just keep coming back stronger and more frequent  I read tons on the subject  and what eventually worked for me was learning to see those thoughts coming and simply acknowledge them as 'oh  intrusive thoughts'  but not judging them as good or bad  Takes practise  But learning that will make you stronger in the long run   Journaling is a very good way to get to the underlying issues  but also just to realize how absurd those thoughts really are  and that there's no evidence that you would ever actually do them  They are thoughts  not impulses  You are not feeling a compulsion to do them  In fact  you are probably horrified by them  That's a good thing  Once you write things down in an anxious moment  and read them again when you are feeling good  you realize how silly they are  And that eventually takes away their power over you   A few articles I saved that helped me back then  that might perhaps help you    http   theworrygames com 2016 02 anxiety scary intrusive thoughts story   http   www megsanity com article asp title Lies Your Brain Tells You Why We Have Scary Thoughts post 49
I felt like this for a long time  but then I realised that I was happy where I am  For example  there were a number of times when I would think I was missing out by not socialising  but whenever I would bite the bullet and go out  I'd always be thinking about home and wanting to be in the comfort of my own home  
My first panic attack came on after a discussion about death with my step father  The fear hits me at night too  for which I take xanax  Obviously that isn't a long term solution so I only take it when it is absolutely necessary  My sister recommended this Alan Watts' video  which did help me some  You might give it a watch      https   www youtube com watch v M7KRgluYeps  I know that probably isn't the answer you're looking for  but I haven't found the answer yet either  Death is a very difficult and anxiety provoking topic for me to discuss and ponder  
Yeah  I echo the sentiment  Hugs to you all  
I've locked myself in our bathroom and I'm to the point where I'll do whatever I can to get better  I can't live like this anymore  I can't let it ruin my life  I refuse to let it fuck this up anymore than it already has  Thank you for helping me  With the holiday I'm going to try to make some calls tomorrow  depending if they're open or not  I'm really going to force myself to do this  I have no other option  I need help  
Stands for exposure response therapy  it's a type of cognitive behavioral therapy that involves confronting an obsession  the thoughts  but refraining from compulsions  the rituals   It's very effective in treating OCD  
Yes  unfortunately  
Look   the stinking dead moose in the room is your high pressure status   School in another COUNTRY   I bet you and your folks have stratospheric performance expectations  right      Plus you living this jetset life  living abroad is stressful EVEN IF YOU ARE HAVING A GOOD TIME    So give yourself a hug and pat on the back   You are at a high pressure time of life  and actually handling it well    Right now   With antibiotics  you have to suck it up until they are finished  but make sure to cover the basics 'in extremis'   no caffeine  no alcohol  plenty of low intensity exercise   time by yourself  no screens   to decompress   listen to ASMR for soothing  breathing exercises or simple meditation  and recover from the toxic impact of antibiotics namely full spectrum vitamins and minerals   and a range of gut repair supplements or foods  especially pre and probiotics      Try magnesium for immediate relief of anxiety  it's worth a try    And know this   you WILL make it through   Good luck for 2017 
There is no objective measure for depression   if you feel depressed  you are depressed  It doesn't matter how you get there  all that matters is what you're going to do about it  Go see a doctor or a therapist  read up on new strategies to deal with your problems  You can only play the hand you're dealt  and this is where you are now  Stop comparing yourself to others and start taking back control of your life 
No  not real blood  Just sort of a mental picture of it happening 
That's good it's effective but it sounds torturous  I'd be so scared to do it 
Ah so then it sounds like OCD 
Yes  you don't have to nor need to forgive  It's entirely up to you and to how you really feel  What matters the most is not being eaten up by bitterness or letting your anger hurt you  Sometimes we can forgive and sometimes some actions are just plain unforgivable   As for your friend  sometimes people project onto others their experience and it's also sometimes a way for them to reassure themselves that what they did was the right thing  ie not to question the pain that light still linger inside   But as other posters mentioned  it's your experience and yours only and everyone should respect that  Take care 
You're welcome  It is possible to improve  Severe depression and severe anxiety ruined my life for many years  I've turned my life around with professional help  and I personally know many others from different group therapy settings who have turned their lives around too  It can be done  Of course  I'm not downplaying your struggles at all though  I just want to highlight the fact that people can and do improve  I hope things work out for you  If anything comes up  feel free to message me  I'm sorry you've been struggling  and I hope things work out for you 
Sorry there buddy  Not really sure how I can help since I'm in a similar situation  All I can do is hope for the best for you and that friends will come your way soon 
Thank you for caring man  it's nice knowing there are still people willing to support others through hard times     Hope everything works out for us in the end 
Wow thank you so much  I really appreciate the advice and those articles  It's so true that they're just thoughts  They scare me but they have no real power over me 
Your bubbles of optimism are just too cute for me to pop
I've really really needed to hear that  Thank you so so much  
You are lonely  isolated and depressed   Therapy will help enormously  but you should look to FRIENDS not a SO as your primary buffer against loneliness      Also  depression results often from unresolved anxiety or stress  so therapy should start to address that too    Plus guess what  Everyone is lonely sometimes  and everyone cries  You are normal  then 
Oooh okay  Then that would be called an intrusive thought which is OCD  Those are not hallucinations  Hallucinations are when you think that's it's really happening because you SEE blood coming from the door  Another thing is most people who hallucinate do not realize they are hallucinating  They won't say "I'm hallucinating blood coming from doors" instead they will say "there is fucking blood coming out of that door  " 
Oh yeah I know how it feels  like    it comes and goes away  I hope you'll stay strong next time it happens 
Yeah I'm not too worried about my post being ignored  It would've been nice to get some conversation going  of course  but I realize yesterday was a pretty busy day in terms of new posts and these kinds of feelings   Thank you for the reply though 
Yo dude  speak to people it can really help a lot  I tried to kill myself 3 weeks ago and failed  it was a girl that pushed me over the edge  If you want to speak PM me  
You're welcome  Good luck and be proud of yourself for making the decision to get better  This is a huge victory

I forced myself to go on the adventure of a life time in May  5 weeks volunteering in Sri Lanka and I only had three panic attack the entire time  I was so immensely proud of myself for going despite everything in my head screaming at me to stay  
You do it enough times you start to love how fresh your breath feels afterwards  And you begin to hate the feeling of morning breath  SO it's definitely worth keeping up  well done mate

I'm 17 and I'm kinda on the same boat like you are  except the suicide part and christianity  I have loving and caring parents  and I'm the only son  Maybe you miss your parents  Has it been a while since you've seen your parents in person  If I were in your boots  I'd pack my stuff and live with in parent's house  Maybe you should hang out with your parents more  
Thank you very much
All NMDA antagonists do  in low doses  They are simultaneously sedating and activating 
Ya it is  but it's completely worth it  Anxiety will be through the roof when trying to not do the compulsion but it will come down and you slowly train your brain to break away from the patterns of OCD
Glad you like it  From the many years of battling anxiety and depression I've hated how society is on this fast train kind of lifestyle  And they expect you to be on the same train  Making you less in control of your life and more in their control  It never started dawning on me until I started asking myself the right questions  Maybe it's age but after it become so exhausting to keep up with societies demands I decided to just not care anymore  Stopped caring who I would effect either  This is my life and I'll walk it how I want to  And I stand tall while doing it  Not just for myself but also in a twisted way to mock everyone in this world that 
Jobs and school aren't everything  and don't expose you to all the parts of the world  You may not have found your 'thing' yet  Try volunteer work   you may find you love helping people  and it could lead into a paid job   and has already been suggested  therapy  Good luck 
Yeah  my Doctor called them hallucinations  but I'm guessing that was a mis labelling

Does the college have campuses  If yeah why not more there  If no  well      d you know
I guess I can definitely relate to that kind of apathy towards the way we are treated  I've never been spiteful   I guess it's partly who I am and partly desenstization as was said  And it's kind of scary sometimes so beware because it an lead to not recognizing what's out of line  I'm currently struggling with putting "healthy boundaries"   sometimes it's insedious   Sometimes I sometimes joke that it kind of feels like having been lobotomized  But then fortunately I can tell myself  "wait a minute  do not forget what happened and draw a line" 
Do you have a history of anxiety  Are you on any medications for anxiety panic attacks  
If this is your GP then he probably doesn't know the correct terminology  Most medical doctors are not well versed in psychology  unfortunately 
2017 New Year's resolutions  1  Work on getting my self confidence back  2  Stop comparing myself to others so much  3  Stop seeking validation from other people   4  Be more comfortable doing things by myself  5  Keep progressing and getting better at supervising at work   6  Don't put so much pressure on myself to find a girlfriend   7  Be open to and have new experiences   8  Don't worry or dwell on the past anymore 
That's good  I'm planning on telling my loved ones to tell me I'm asking for reassurance when I am  Is this a kind of ERP  since I'm not getting the reassurance I want 
We're all sad people now 
Oh yeah  i feel you OP  Nothing can ever replace that kind of want for me  I want it so much  To feel loved and embraced  
I've just relapsed after 2 years without medication  and for a couple of months I was worse than I've ever been  I've vowed to try anything and everything  and do better than I did last time  Write down how I'm feeling  talk about the things that are actually bothering me in therapy instead of avoiding them  being honest with myself and others about WHY I feel the way I do  I actually regulate my breathing and engage in mindfulness colouring  Anything that last time I would have dismissed as hippie bull     I'm actually giving a go  I can't go back on meds so it's all I've got  I'm doing ok  and I know you can too   You can look at a relapse as a failure  and as a step back  or you can look at it as a chance to get EVEN better upon another recovery  I'm trying to think the latter  thats's all I've got right now 
Glad I could help  I noticed reading about other people's experiences  that had made it to the other side  really helped me  It's just so tough while you're in it if you have no idea what to do about it  and feel like you're alone in it  You're not  Lots of people experience the same thing or have at some point in their lives  Most found a way out  and so will you     And you'll probably end up stronger than before as a result of facing that 
Keep trying to find new distractions  When you are so occupied that you don't run out of them anymore  maybe you'll feel better
Same  I crave friendships and relationships where I can share and learn and grow with those people  I have had it before and I know how enriching it is  But now I'm alone again and it is so difficult  
Remember 2 years ago   You commented on a guy's reddit post for pokemon x and y when he was finding friends  Im sure at the time you had made him really happy by adding him  Now i know this is the typical statement  but maybe you should get back into pokemon as a hobby  find friends on the subreddits I understand what you mean though  by every logic  it we should be living horrible lives  Indeed  enjoying meaningless hobbies   Having people that care for you   With the current life that i lead  it should be IMPOSSIBLE but even so  I believe that you and I can somehow make something good out of this shitty world and find meaning to our lives   
I feel the same  very anxious and alone  But I do not feel that I have the whole year for make or break  I probably have only this month for things at last to improve 
What  Fuck that shit it's 2017  B  Seriously though that ridiculous  don't let it bring you down
Need more info dude to find out the actual cause  I was on mirtazapine a few years back didn't help at all  then went on to sertraline and again nothing so I gave up the meds  After a suicide attempt 3 weeks ago I'm on venlafaxine now and still no different  but my problems are down to the way I think and meds aren't going to change that  you may just need someone to speak to dude  PM if you need to 
Yeah  what do you like to do mate  I'd like to know as well  
I sometimes have this happen  Almost like I'm really really cold and just shivering  Only problem is it happens regardless of temperature  
I also think that there's no reason to celebrate but since people do it anyway  it's good to try to participate  For me  it isn't about a different number on the calendar  it is about enjoying the  few  good people in my life 
i learned python now i am trying to learn c    i really want to build a website  
Time is an arbitrary concept  so are the numbers we attach to it  It's difficult to get around that 
i am into web design but i really want to get into making video games 
I couldn't either  last time I drank I went to a dark  dark place and hurt my hand

I have a similar obsessions compulsion where I write every word I hear in cursive in my head and also trace it with my finger  like I'm writing it in the air  It sometimes gets shut off  I have no control over when it gets turned on  off   What happens if you resist the urge to write   
Well probably my favorite thing to do is cooking   There is something amazing about creating something that makes people smile  I really enjoy cooking because it is so calming for me  you get in a flow of things and just have a good time   And in the end  sometimes at least    you will even have a nice meal   Other than that   I also enjoy gaming  I don't play a lot but I watch twitch streams whenever I get the chance  watching people play league is a massive part of my life by now  
I did ecstacy at a big festival last night  By the time it had worn off I realized I was still dancing my ass off and being very social  It helped show me my true self and I plan on trying to bring it out this year 
If that's what you want hope for then by all means make a family  It's like a little society in itself  However not everyone wants can make one  especially due to SA  
Me either  Usually on holidays I end up texting a few people I know and wishing them well and they will respond  But I didn't even bother last night  No messages when I woke up either   
No dorms  I could rent an apartment or something nearby  but I don't really have money to spend right now 
I agree with the NC  I've learnt the hard way and was in your situation not so long ago and actually it's a never ending circle except if you exfiltrate yourself from it  They ineed act civil at first but then it's to prepare for an even more violent shitstorm  And even when one doesn't feel the need to mend anything and that it's just out of compassion  from my experience it's useless and even quite dangerous for you  too much trauma and fragilty can emerge afterwards  
Okay  How are you coping 
Happy new year  We can all pull through this together  no matter how bad the anxiety is 
theyre the ones with the problem  do they think youre psychic 
Are you seeing a therapist  You might need exposure therapy to work through this fear    
I know how it is  We should just take a day at a time  I know for aure I can't have a year like last year again   way too much 
I guess it's my turn to pay it forward   I know the feeling and circumstance you are talking about  no action you take betters your situation all the while everything just keeps deteriorating  Career  Family  Health  and Life in general   You have to understand one thing  It's the perception of mind  the intent of actions  and performing the intended action that will slowly but steadily change your circumstance  Unless you understand this and apply it to every aspect of your life  nothing will change  Another thing I would add is that the change wont happen overnight  It will take months before you see the effects    What you need to do is install new habits  adapt new values  and ultimately change your mindset so that the actions that you take yield the desired results      Here's what helped me       Creating a routine ritual  This way you have something to look forward to through the day     Workout  Hit the gym  focus on form  repetition  and then the weights  Don't have money  look into calisthenics  All you will need is your body  ground  and a pull up bar   Elementary school playgrounds have them and are free to use after school hours   After a few weeks  you will notice that you're less aggressive  have a more defined self esteem  and will begin to value self discipline and persistence     Eat  Not eating doesn't do anyone any good  You will be bitchy through the day and people will reflect that bitchiness back at you  If you are working out  you will need your strength so eat a balanced diet     Breathing exercises  Not sure why  but they will make you more mindful  make your body more efficient  and increase concentration  I suggest the Wim Hoff method since it's free on youtube     Clean up  Shave  get a haircut  brush your teeth  take showers  wear clean clothes  etc  It's nice tell people to nor judge a book by it's cover  but let's face it  your presentation of yourself will dictate how many folks look at you  This will also help you get a job     Few other thoughts       Ask yourself what success means to you  And then make really small goals steps to accomplish it  If you just perform the above steps without a set goal  you will aimless proceed through life and you will not be in tune with the changes      Hug your dad  He is the only dad you will ever have in this world  Even if you hate him  after a few weeks  you both will realize the the need for each other  If you don't see any changes at least know that you tried to love      Plasma donation usually give  10 30 depending on your location  It isn't much but it will put food on the table for a day or two  Also  there are churches and soup kitchens that can help you out      Wake up every morning and look at yourself  Make eye contact with yourself  And then tell yourself that you will put all your effort in whatever you are doing regardless of the outcome  There is nothing more "manly"  your words not mine  than giving your best and accepting the win or fail outcome    Good Luck   D 
Go to the festival that I've already bought the tickets for  don't be a complete hermit and maybe even get a job 
After forty five years of self loathing and perennial self harm thoughts  I finally found the help I needed   Yes  it does get better  It does take way too fucking long  imo   but the man I am today would be nearly unidentifiable to my children  both physically  I've lost nearly 100lbs from my peak and 50 since I last saw my girls  as well as being completely me  nearly symptom free  and recently described as the embodiment of don Miguel Ruiz call that we all love until we can help everyone   It gets massively better    Find your solution  The Four Agreements was life altering for me   once on the twisted road home  you will find more peace than you thought possible  even if you've never known it before 
I like your insight  
I used to work with dual diagnosis kids and saw abilify change lives  I personally had an awful experience    I was sleeping 20 hrs a day no matter the dosage and wetting myself through out the day night when I first was put on it in high school    As the above person said  sounds like doctor is being careful which is good  Antipsychotics  especially with kids need to be monitored  But give it a chance    You're a rock star parent  Keep on keeping on 
It sounds as if these irrational thoughts are brought on by larger markets or places where crowds of people are to be expected  It's probably uncommon for you to visit such places  making it overwhelming  With time  it'll become easier  It doesn't sound as if your Anxiety is preventing you from leaving the house or anything so just keep trying    Best of luck  
I dont mean to dismiss you  but I cant even get  one   assignment done  So should I make smaller goals  or take a different approach 
If you're a guy stay away from prostitutes  Prostitutes and bipolar do not mix well   Masturbation is prob your best bet besides sex  and that's just temporary relief   But it's lasted months for me  so it can be exhausting to keep up   Def get to Dr  for some meds to help cool off if you don't have anything   Good luck 
You should watch Chill with Bob Ross    that's what I'm doing right now  it's so calming 
i am 27 living with my parents and I had sex for the first time 2 weeks ago and the first time wasnt that great either   Three days ago I desided to change my life  and made a linkedin account and there seem to be many opportunities there but you need to setup linkedin properly  
I fucked up already  I hurt someone I care about and have no idea how to fix it  I'm jumping between feeling like a god wanting to step in the river and wanting to fuck anything that moves
How was it 
   it really isn't meant to be if you've been trying for a year  If she doesn't want to talk to you then it would be best to honour that if you really did love her 
Therapy has helped me immensely   It took a few tries to find the right person  but when I did  it was like I could finally start feeling myself make progress   My therapist knows me well enough to know how far to push me  when to stop the session and calm things down  and how to make sure I leave her with a smile   So I personally would say it's worthwhile   Having someone who I can just talk to helps a lot

It will  I promise it will  All one can do is be the nicest  kindest and friendly person that one can be  Fuck everything else   I live by one principle  if you don't like something being done to you  don't do it to others  Or  treat others as you wish to be treated   It's one common theme across all major religions   If we all lived by this principle  the world would be a better place  It's such a simple code to live by 
This is awesome    Proud of you OP
Even though it's too late now   for the future I really suggest you take it slow and not overload yourself no matter the "reward" for doing so  I had A LOT of friends who took a ton of honors AP classes and though some did benefit from scholarships or college admissions  way more of them failed  were burnt out  and regretted it  I made a similar mistake I've always been a workaholic so I took two jobs this summer to work 65 hours a week and make     and a month in my anxiety hit me like a brick wall and now I don't even have a job  This is an extreme example but you get my point   As for right now I would seek some help  be it a guidance counselor or a therapist outside of school  I recommend anyone doing this  even more so people with anxiety issues  I would have been so much better if I did that while I was in HS  Good luck  
Things won't magically be better because yesterday was 2016 and today is 2017  That's not how things work   To get better  you have to actually  do  something constructive for yourself  
Yeah  I realize now that in the long run it probably won't work out  Thanks for the help 
I've spent the last ten years using bipolar as a sort of victim card because it was easier for me to use it than to address it  I know that probably makes me sound like an awful person  but whatever    Diagnosis or not get the help you think you need and don't be afraid to be your own advocate  The med trial and error game suckkkks  And antipsychotics in general are no walk in the park  but just wait it out    I was originally diagnosed depressed than had a HUGE antidepressant induced sleeping 2 hours a night  solving the worlds problems  as hyper sexual as a hardly pubescent 14 year old girl manic episode that took about a month and a shit ton of abilify to bring down  And after times trial and errors  unintentionally going off my meds  getting hospitalized  going on and off meds for years  experimenting with adderall only to find it changed me life  un medicated stabilizing through out pregnancy and breast feeding  and my most recent depressive crash I'm full of diagnosises and found a med combo that is promising   It's not an easy road  but dude  you've made it this far with out the diagnosis  you can keep on  Just advocate for yourself  Be as strong as you can  find support for when you need help being strong and keep your head held high      Also haven't slept this year cause I suck at meds sometimes so this is me trying to type out my thoughts before they go away  
   thanks bud you too
I HIGHLY suggest checking out the book "The Imp of The Mind" by Lee Baer  He talks all about intrusive thoughts and gives some advice about them  I have OCD which makes the intrusive thoughts even more problematic and I was hospitalized for exactly the thoughts you had  I was scared I'd give into them even though they were totally against my character  Therapy and medication has helped a lot with this and you learn how to deal with them    Good luck 
sex was very awkward in the car  Obviously I dont have my own apartment  that is why she broke up with me  At least one of the reasons  However  it wasnt as I thought it would be  The next time that followed was better but still  awkward   My change in life  Linkedin seems a great tool  I applied for 10 interhsips already  I was a bit late to apply for the google intern  but I will try another year  maybe I will have more experience and I will be a better candidate  
I can't resist it  it will keep coming back  I try to resist it and go to sleep one day  next morning I try to remember it  it's tiring  I can't even sleep sometimes because it need to be written 
Well hey don't loose all motivation either  just take a step back and judge yourself fairly and DO NOT beat up on yourself whatever the outcome  
I'm feeling down today as well  I'm one to listen to depressing music when I feel down tho  Maybe you're looking for happy chill music      I really like Anderson Paak's Malibu album  It's got a relaxing hip hop feel to it   If you want a sad song  Stop the world by krizz kaliko is definitely it  
Oh boy sounds bad    And of course on a holiday weekend   Get in to your Psych or the ER ASAP if you're thinking of suicide   I don't know about the details  but often we can be forgiven for some of our transgressions   Usually our loved ones know it's not us but an illness 
I feel exactly this  this exact feeling is why I'm on this subreddit right now  
Yeah I remember that feeling  But you should just throw yourself into a club or something and see if you can integrate yourself  People switch groups all the time  It's way easier honestly in college when there are so many likeminded and aged people around you  
I was 25 when I applied for my first internship  I had no degree  it was a design agency   so I contacted the CEO directly  She knew I had no credentials  but she saw I was eager to bust my ass  One month in and they offered me a position   It's possible  you just really need to want it 
Another member of the club here    Just trying to hang on
Any advise for someone who just graduated  I don't have clubs to join
The bad thing of LinkedIn is that if you use it to message people  your account would be banned  I send a few messages already and now I have to insert a code to send a message  Big firms also are impossible to call unless for product service   But yea  I plan on calling them  at least the ones that are possible   edit  I also think it is not possible if you just really want it   I have been wanting it for a very long time  but depression was holding me back  You need action and that is what I am trying to do 
I'm not feeling that great myself at the moment but in the past when I've been not enjoying my life from day to day I imagine a happier future self that I almost see as a seperate person and imagine that they are really grateful that present me took the time to do things like get an education that make their life a little easier and safer  Sorry if that doesn't help  sometimes you just have to find any way you can to get through it  
This is actually common with your eyes closed when experiencing mono  I don't experience it much anymore but it all started when I started having extreme symptoms of mono when I was in 5th grade  Hospitalized for three days because of it  
Not currently  I was considering doing CBT but I'm not sure how well I could handle it 
Have you used any of the APIs  Direct3D  OpenGL  Vulkan  etc  Or any game engine  like that one that's open source  forget the name   I've used OpenGL 3 in C   for a few things  it's easy  I have no idea how to use java
My ex boyfriend has said this exact thing to me more than once and it really does terrify me that he thinks like this   Stay strong  buddy  Honestly  There's so much yet to be done in your life  you don't want to miss it 
Depends  In most multiplayer games it  competitive especially  leads to frustration and annoyance  But some of my fondest gaming memories come from communicating as well  When Firefall had thumping at high levels  with everyone working together and communicating  it was fantastic  
Agreed  It's a really weird thing to experience when you're in a public space  The exchanges interactions that others have  you just sit there and wonder 'why not me'  What sucks most is when you're a seemingly normal person that's put together and coherent  but inside everything is unbearably uncomfortable and hopeless 
What clandestine said  I'd also recommend getting out and doing something physical if you think you can manage that 
Yeah  I started off taking 500 mg per day and saw some temporary benefit  Then I read a study that demonstrated how three depressed patients went in full remission after taking 2 3 grams per day  I have been taking two grams per day for about a month now  I am currently experimenting with dividing the two grams into two seperate doses and taking both grams at once  I have read some anecdotes that taking two grams at once works better  In any case  it will likely take a couple of weeks before you see any benefit   I have also been taking 4 5 mg of low dose Naltrexone per day  which I suspect is helping as well  Interestingly  both Naltrexone and Agmatine have tolerance reducing properties  I have no idea if these mechanisms directly play a role in their antidepressant effects or if other effects are at play  However  both substances seem to be sustainable treatments  as opposed to treatments that need to be cycled   which is probably the best characteristic for a compound intended to treat anhedonia  
At times life is good  at times it feels like worth of giving up  Fixing those issues is like moving a mountain just to get to the starting point where other people start their journey 
I have had mainly "Pure O" OCD my entire life  It makes living painful  and unrelated struggles become fifteen times harder  I can't shut my mind off  I'm always seeking reassurance  always assuming the absolute worst  It gives me a short temper because the anxiety rises up like a volcano under stress   I can't have discussions with my friends and disagree with them on something because I feel like I'm inherently wrong  that I'm flawed  that the things I think and feel are not as valid as anyone else's  It's why I'm constantly seeking reassurance  If I don't feel like I'm "perfect" to someone  it gives me a lot of anxiety  I can't have different views than my friends because I feel like my friends are "tainted" if they feel differently about something I take personally  it messes with that feeling of having "perfection"   I can't take anything at face value  I have to scrutinize and analyze and turn it over and over in my head until my brain is numb  I don't know how other people are so laid back and can let things go  It's foreign to me  everything in my brain has to be in order  have a place  be controlled and perfect    I get intrusive thoughts too  I have a hard time with sexual things because I always suddenly picture something awful  But those things bother me less than the constant analyzing  I'm so exhausted that I went to a sleep disorder center and they thought I had narcolepsy  I don't  we found out  because my brain is so burned out    I can't think of what else to say right now  I've been to therapy and have practiced mindfulness techniques  I've been on every kind of OCD medication  I just want peace  I'm too tired to try and keep going  
Yeah  Even I wish  there was someone or some sort of guidance to deal with anxiety at a young age  But I'm glad I understand it better now 
Hey   U ok  
I did the same  and while it would have been nice to have been invited to more places  I got like 1 half assed invitation   I wasn't upset about not doing anything NYE  It's more about having to tell people you did nothing  I don't want them to pity me  so I feel like I've gotta make something up  like when my parents ask what I did  
I wrote about it  here  https   www reddit com r SuicideWatch comments 5i99lj 31 december 2016 ship canal bridge figured most db7k7yk  context 3  
Same  it doesn't help that someone I literally just made friends with not too long ago cut ties with me without warning or telling me why  I feel so alone 
Okay  I understand  Do you have a support system for when times get tough 
i didn't get into APIs that's a bit of an advanced topic for an armature   like me      if you've been able to learn c   then java won't be any problem  
That's exactly why I'm so scared of relationships   
 awesome  I always wanted to learn to code but I think it would be too much for my brain haha  Dont have the time either
Yes  not giving into the compulsion  reassurance seeking  for example  is part of the ERP  but one thing that ERP involves is specific triggering of things  carefully chosen  so that you don't start with stuff too far advanced  it's entirely staggered so that you build up to the hard triggers  and then active resistance of the compulsions  So  it is a very active process  It is difficult  but achievable   like climbing a mountain  you go one step at a time  and you bring along the right supports  I think of it like going outside into the sun after having lived indoors for years   you'll get a bad sunburn fast  so you need to work up slowly to being able go to the beach  if you get my drift   I'm glad to hear that you're making your friends family part of the process by letting them know about reassurance seeking behaviour  Friends and family can be amazing allies in overcoming OCD  Good luck 
Very true  I think it was the combination of a new place  lots of people crowded into one room  and the fact I was the only new person  Whatever  ill get over it 
Thanks man 
Thanks 
Yeah  but i think that since I was new and don't stand out  they all probably thought I was understanding of their traditions
Yea  saw some fireworks walked home and cried three hours straight without being able to stop  For the last three and a half years that has been my holiday routine  I hate my life 
Thanks man  likewise

Gone  A shame I only had one to give  Either way  I strongly suggest journaling to everyone  If you aren't already  google the benefits of journaling and gratitude journaling too 
I used to get it on my right calf muscle  Everything's fine right now  I stopped worrying about the thought that something was wrong  the twitches disappeared  Hope it gets better for you  
it will b difficult for me yes    worse i dont know   i m going to take steps to get myself out of this mess  Fuck the world 
1  Making an appointment to see a therapist   2  Getting a job  Possibly starting with volunteer work  I want to do something where I can help people  like volunteering at a crisis hotline  3  Going to the gym more often  I'm buying a calendar from Target to track the days that I go to the gym  Maybe I'll put little stickers on the days that I go or do something nice for myself if I reach a certain number of days  The calendar app on my phone is nice  but I thought this would be more fun and stickers are cute   
Yesterday I saw some fireworks walked home and cried three hours straight without being able to stop and for the last three and a half years that has been my routine for new years  It is really starting to be unbearable 
I've been weaning myself off of caffeine for the last week  I usually have 3 cup of coffee at home and a LG Iced coffee on the way to work  Now  one regular cup at home  and a LG Decaf Iced Coffee on the way to work
Fuck it  Just do it 
That's what i've been telling everyone how i feel  I say I'm just an observer my whole entire life  Trying to fit in a world that i'm not compatible with  
I have a long drive ahead with my wife and kids   Then she has to talk to me and I'm pretty sure she wants a divorce   I don't want to lose my kids  I've been sick to my stomach and wanted to cry all day   I have no one to turn to    And my kids don't even know yet   I just give up

Are you me from a different timeline or something   A very similar thing happened to me yesterday   Me and some other guy I'm somewhat familiar with came quite a bit early to my friend's place to help with the food and just to have some fun before the party  Well  at least the evening wasn't all bad when it was just the three of us  I've actually had some decent time   Then the guests came  They were mostly people from my friend's uni so I hardly knew any of them   I clearly wasn't on the same page with anything that was going on  At first I just stood there brooding and having an occasional drink to numb the shitty feeling growing up inside  Eventually I started walking around the place and came across an empty bedroom  I sat there on the floor and then had the worst panic attack in my life   I was fucking petrified  shaking  my entire body felt numb and tingling like when your hand falls asleep  I couldn't stop crying and I could hardly breathe  This shit went on for more than an hour    At least no one saw what a train wreck of a human being I am   When finally I was semi functioning I said my goodbyes and crawled back home   I'm still feeling utterly miserable  Will it ever fucking end  
Podcast's  or the like  I find those calm my nerves of the most 
That's what I've been so paranoid about lately  Everyone who I considered to be close friends suddenly wants nothing to do with me  They've cut ties with me without telling me why    I feel like one of them is talking shit behind my back   I just don't understand 
I've been crying to myself for at least 2 hours  i just feel like shit  
Somehow I kinda felt the same during mid college years  Since you say you had a rough 2016   its the past there is no need to think of it even if you feel like it  you can only go forward and if you decide to think ahead  it will make you feel way better even if things didn't workout the way you like to  I know life isn't easy if we overthink every stuff that happens  why do you feel that you don't have friends that care   have they done something or ignored you when you needed them the most  you know   you can make them care by caring  I mean   maybe make some new friends or show them that you care by asking them some questions that would get their attention  and remember you don't need others to make you feel better   feeling good comes from within yet friends are important  its going to be alright   don't overthink stuff and have a purpose  maybe make a small change in your life and the way you think   life without a purpose or something to hope for and look forward to can be depressing

jesus christ literally me this morning 
Try different ways and find the right path for you  The most important of all things is that you don't give up  Everyone is able to study just in different ways  Let us know how it's going   Another thought  Why don't you ask your parents or even your sister to help you and honestly try 
So I guess the stories of being a wizard when you hit 30 as a virgin weren't real      
 u crowbird  it's not that hard you gotta start small   start with a simple to use and easy to learn programming language like python or visual basic hope this helped     
I feel the same way 
2017 will be the year i do something  Either die or live  not more of this living hell   
Perhaps you could treat it as an escape button in case things go bad  Do something crazy like go swimming in a public pool 
I don't have anyone to celebrate with
At least you have that option there  I live in NYC and getting a gun is near impossible  especially for me because i have medical record of suicide attempt  I wish i have a loaded gun in my closet  that would bring me so much comfort knowing i can always have that option  I hope it brings you comfort too  knowing you have a easy and quick exit always available to you  
The moment I tried to be more outgoing and try to make new friends is the moment my college career was taken away from me  I'm tired of trying  
have you seen "Search Party"   Pretty funny but also tense series  Has one season so far 
I'm so sorry  Like you said  people are cunts    I'll never understand them 
Every last single one of us do it  The most depresding thing about depression is how yours is no different than mine or anyone else's here  So the next time think "  does anyone else  " the answer is yes 
I don't have an answer  but your feelings are very normal    College is a waste as far as preparing people for the real world    You might be doing better than you think      I remember one thing when I had to manage other people   Your best people always believe they are failing  and your failing people always think they are doing great   My guess is you are really doing great and don't realize it     If you are like me  you can manage anxiety as long as you can work 40 hours a week  get sleep  eat  and exercise   If I work 50 hours I lose it   If your job always requires more than 40 hours  you may need to find another job   If you can work with your boss to get hours down to 40  I would consider staying   
where can I find it 
u have to question ur SA thoughts and ask why u expect certain things in certain situations  Like hearing peeps laugh n thinking they must be laughing at YOU specificly   One day i realized how ridiculous it was and how its all just self projection   I was in a climbing hall with some pals socializing I couldnt reach the top of a climbing tower so i jumped down to try again and just as soon as my feet touched the ground  i heared giggling from some chicks behind me a little further away and instantly thought they were laughing at me   In that moment i felt totally embarrased for basically nothing but unlike usual i didnt just accept the negativ SA thought but instead questioned it like   "why would they be laughing at me "  " how should i even know they are laughing about me "  then i looked around in the hall  everyone was in their own world concetrating on the their tower  which one to climb next  or just having fun joking  talking with others  And I realized nobody really cares if u fail or look retarded everyone is inside their world minding their business    And even if u fail and someone laughs  like u slip and almost fall in the middle of the bus and everyone sees and some ppl giggle laugh happend to me 2x in a week  you have to remind yourself how irrelevant that 10 max 30 sec scene was in your 100000  hours film called life 
4 years for me  yay  T T
Thanks both of you  I'll give my fitness pal a try 
Sorry man idk how I would deal with that type of stuff  Would surely ruminate about it for awhile  It sucks  
I've joked that I just need to buy a huge rv to be able to leave my little safety bubble  as my biggest agoraphobia triggers are lack of privacy in which to calm down and being away from my bathroom  Both of these could be eased a good bit by being able to head to the back of the rv to lay down  use the bathroom  turn on Netflix  put a cold washcloth on my neck  etc    But then I think about trying to maneuver a huge rv among traffic  in and out of parking  around corners  and I freak out even harder  So I'd need to be rich and hire a driver     
No life being lived is wasted  ever  You'll get through this and who knows you could meet someone who has their own issues  most people do to some extent  you could be their rock despite your own illness  
Feeling like this is incredibly common among people who are depressed  Depression sucks the energy and motivation out of you  you notice you're not doing much any more  you think you're lazy  depression deepens  slows you down more  It's a vicious cycle   I try to remind myself of this  and it is very easy to see in other people  but I also find I get disgusted and angry at myself for the same reasons you do 
Hey  its a weird world we live right know  Im in a similar situation  and honestly spending time with other people works for me  Its comforting for me to listen about their everyday problems  or what they did  or what they are planning  Sadly not too many people want to spend their time with me  But even tho Im struggling with few other problems  also anger  cursing  bad thoughts   Im trying to learn from every action I took  and make myself better  Lately I started doing some exercises  It works for Your mind good too   Check out "Boyinaband" channel on Youtube  He did a challange connected with his mental health  that made me reconsider few things   So yeah  if You would like to talk  I can help 
I think that this is probably a common concern for people with mental illnesses  OP  I worry about this  too   The fact that you are even concerned about this makes me think that it is not the case  Also  it's okay to just want reassurance  someone to talk to  or even just a hug sometimes   
same here nothing ever changes
Good luck  Programming is very rewarding and fun  
Thank you so much I really needed that 
Never change yourself for this  Never  False communion is a poison worse than loneliness 
Hey I'm 19  and experiencing the same thing as you  Please please please PM me  
Have you considered therapy  
I think that will be the only thing to be rid of the symptoms

It's good to know that i am not alone    Thanks for the advice  i really appreciate it   
Same here  it sucks but me and some friends just jumped online and brought our New Year together playing some Gears 4   Nowhere near as good as kissing the guy or gal of ya dreams but I figured it was better to occupy my mind with laughter and fun than dread or brood the fact that I'm essentially alone    Pick your mental battles and try to win em this year  Happy New Year  friends  
stop interacting with people
uh it was uploaded to tbs's site I think  Otherwise just google it  It's not on Netflix or something

I only count failure as having not got past my front door  you fell at the last hurdle BUT you just vaulted 20 of them like a champ PLUS you used your feelings of failure  not actual failure  just feeling like you failed  disappointment  to get out again AND work on a plan that would lead you to hopefully be able to achieve what you wanted to do next time  Nowhere near a failure 
i feel the same

What does a non depressed lazy person look like 
Thanks
I'm currently in a situation that has some similarities to yours  33 year old guy  having just left my wife due to me realising I don't love her any more  I don't want to go back to her  but being single is making me incredibly lonely  I only have one close friend  who I can't see very often  I'm also in the UK   I'm also thinking I need to get out there and make more friends  but I don't really know where to start   I can't really offer advice  I guess I just wanted to say you're not alone 
Always nice to see people here face the fear of SA 
This is my goal  Look at people and think about every single one of them with love   Even when I feel humiliated  angry  tired  hungry  frightened or ignored   Remember that they have no responsability for or power over my emotions  I just know that working on changing my attitude   every single day   will make it easier for me  And easier for other people to like me    
This  
dude this is totally me  And my depression is also much much more severe than probably 99  of the people in this discord or sub  I don't give a shit about anime and I also find RPG's boring as fuck 
Mine is more dedicated to my depression  To finally lose weight and become thin  I've been fat all my life  I've always dreamed of changing my profile picture to a thin me

You have people  Id love to have people t share these feeling of anxiety with  Gotten sick 2nights in and told to leave work on the 2nd one and am fearing for my job when hopefully theres no reason to 
Hey  thanks for your reply  Much appreciated  One followup question  any particularly noteworthy adverse effects when you started taking LDN   Low dose naltrexone is something I've learned about only recently  
Thanks
A third of my friends are college graduates  a third college drop outs and a third married with kids  They all stress me out in diff ways but the ones who partied all the time gave me the most anxiety out of any friendships I've had  Mind you I hate substances  Had a great run with them and then just lost the desire to do them anymore  I'm the odd girl out having 1 glass of wine at dinner and feeling guilty about it  But I realized for me personally something changed in me  My goals  my morals  Somehow through my anxiety I persevered and made it to adult hood with my head on straight  Unfortunately straight on doesn't always mean ok  I don't go to house parties  I don't drink at the club  Music festivals used to be my life and now I'd rather save the money for other things  It took me a while to accept that I'm changing into an adult I never saw myself wanting to be  Hum drum boring and lame  But it helps my anxiety to just be me  Unapologetically just lame old me  
   there's hope for us afterall   
I'm planning on not surviving 
Cutting your arm is safest for me to avoid making a mistake
Wow yes  very recognizable   But I can't say more without some more context  why you broke up  etc  
Don't feel too bad  My brother's friend came round to our house once and sat on the cat  Poor guy was very embarrassed  cat was fine   
I recommend reading The Happiness Trap  This book has been helpful for me  still trying to determine my purpose though 
How long has it been since you both broke up  Would you setback together with him 
Thanks fkr the reply  I listen to quite a few podcasts but I'm always afraid to listen at night because if I fall asleep I'll lose my place    Got any favorites  particularly ones that it doesn't really matter if you doze off

My PC kept me alive I don't know what to do with out it
As I walk down the street  I imagine all the terrible things that could happen to people happening  It's very vivid for me too  Any excursion outside plays through my head like a disaster movie  I also compulsively read news  and sometimes fixate on events that resonate with me in some way   The intrusive thoughts don't bother me anymore  The way I deal with them is maybe silly  but it works for me  I let them play through my head like a movie  but sort of back off in my head so it's all actually on a screen  Then I turn the screen off or just walk away  Sometimes it comes back  but I just turn it off again and try to distract myself   The compulsive news checking is harder  My anxiety that leads to it stems from other things besides intrusive thoughts  I also have Tourette's   and I haven't figured out how to stop the checking  But if you ever just want to talk to someone with similar problems  feel free to message me 
Idk I think Filipinos can be pretty cute  Personally I think dark skinned asians tend to be cuter than light skinned asians 
It's an distraction  Might be beneficial  I can talk to others   May be harmful  because it only covers up and postpones my problems 
Yes  It can  I've experienced it before  I literally went years without really touching someone  
Dear  u rob cornelius  thank you so much for all your kind words to everyone and your support of this sub  You're a good friend to people here 
they do stuff without me and i dont think they are my friends  i do have some friends who "care" but they dont try to talk or anything 
I have moments like this but then feel like a hypocrite since I havent sent any either  I think about everyone but i doubt they want to get a message from me so i dont  Its fine though 
End of January at the soonest 
I get super vivid boring dreams    like I'll dream about getting ready and then my alarm wakes me up and I think well I can stay in longer cause I already got ready and then I'm late to work AND had to get ready twice  Or I'll dream about paying bills  Seriously I don't lead a dull life but in dream land I do and it screws me over    It's really just an annoyance and it's totally worth it because I now go days with out think death is a logical option  
Thankyou 
I find writing to be helpful  journaling can be very underrated  Make sure to date them so can track your progress 
It will get better  If you truly believe and want to get out from this step by step  day by day  You will thank yourself in some years and look back at this period of your life like a chapter  The things you experience now will give you alot of qualities a person  You see the world in black right now  We all have our own way of getting out from a depression  You just gotta keep fighting   3
for me personally  when i pick i dont feel any pain  no matter how deep i go because i get into a 'mode' and become fairly numb    But yes afterwards the spots do hurt and are sore if i touch them
New year same shit to be honest  I have had a bad few days and it's most certainly not getting better  So just know you're not alone 
If it's something that's recurring and causing quality of life issues I'd recommend seeing your doctor and possibly getting a referral to a psychiatrist  On your own  you can look into the book Feeling Good by Dr  David Burns  It has some information on anxiety and mood disorders  as well as exercises and techniques  cognitive behavioral therapy  to deal with them  Other than that  speaking with a therapist is usually quite helpful  Even talking with a friend or journaling your anxieties and emotions helps ground your thoughts  making it easier to deal with the anxiety 
I think we  this sub  still mostly thinks of suicide as something bad  We don't want each other to kill oneself    But we won't shame or guilt a person about it   About describing it as a battle or a fight  I understand very much where that comes from  And I can follow the thought  Yet on the other hand psychologists have learned that it's not helpful to use martial language when it's about describing cancer  There is so much military language in use  "Fought the battle enemy"  "lost the the brave fight"  "a survivor"  "beat it"  Again  I understand where it comes from  But often it's not helpful  If cancer comes back it's not the fault of an ill person who's not trying hard enough  There is no "losing the fight"    Some links    https   www theguardian com society 2014 apr 25 having cancer not fight or battle   http   www cancer net blog 2015 05 choosing your words wisely imagery metaphors and cancer   http   www nytimes com 2011 08 28 opinion sunday cancer fighting words html   http   www practicalradonc org article S1879 8500 16 30091 1 abstract cc y 
Initially  I experienced delayed sleep and temperature changes  When I upped my dosage to 4 5 mg  I experienced worsening of one of my IBS symptoms  but that has subsided  My doctor predicted that would happen  LDN is actually phenomenal for IBS       I am currently two months in and one side effect that has remained is vivid dreams  They're the type of dreams that you wake up and question whether or not the dream was real  My sleep has definitely improved though    Lastly  my appetite has been consistently reduced  almost to the same extent as Adderall  Managing that side effect takes planning   So the side effects are bearable  One thing to look out for is rashes  I've heard scattered anecdotes of facial rashes  but I haven't experienced it  
The number is different but the shit is the same
Rooster teeth podcast as its mostly just them talking about random stuff or there life  or the stuff you should know podcast is also pretty nice  Also one that i forgot to add is audio books  they give my mind something to think about other then being anxious  
I don't want you to feel like you're not entitled to calling yourself depressed because you do in fact deserve to call your state of mind however you want  after all it's your mind  Depressed is just another label which I don't like  
I can't comment on how my age has affecting anything  because I was just diagnosed   but I've had fairly a positive experience with Latuda  if that's what you're thinking of trying next  
Doing okay  Christmas was a struggle  
Ya  you become the witness of everything  Depressed people think a lot  it's one of the reasons why we suffer  Other people don't stop to analyze things  they are fine with whatever is in life for them and lucky for their happy genes 
Can you get your doctor to write up a letter explaining your depression and that you are receiving treatment  That might help as it's coming from a medical professional   I have no advice on getting out of bed  sadly  Most of the reason I kept showing up for work the last few years was that calling off was harder for me than just picking my clothes off the floor and going in  I got so I could get ready half asleep and show up at work with no idea how I got there    But once I was there I worked hard to pass the time and take my mind off things  so I didn't seem lazy or depressed so much at work   My husband tried to help by making sure that I had food  tea  a lunch packed  etc  He did everything he could to make sure that I kept the job and I still barely made it  I still had  so many  lates last year that I almost got fired   I finally got sat down and asked directly about the lates and had to admit that I was depressed  That was about a month into a new medication  and since then I've done much better but I feel relieved that my manager knows if I call off it's because I really need a mental health day  and he understands   Edit  I work in retail  which is incredibly difficult at times but offers a lot of latitude for "good workers" to slip on attendance because it's so hard to find people who are willing to show up at all  let alone do their jobs well 
And did it get better after you found someone  
Had multiple breakdowns in December alone  and thought about taking all my pills and just being over it  Today I woke up  took some st John's wort for my mood and actually just forced myself to be positive and set some life goals  I'll probably crash  but I'm gonna use this holiday as an excuse to get better  We can do it people 
I haven't had plans with people not in my family on new years in ages  It sucks and I understand why you hate it  I literally just laid in my bed and just scrolled through reddit 
I usually talk about concepts  and I give a pretty long explanation for it to make sense  But sometimes people forget what my main concept is and start referring to things within my explanation  Anyways  Im trying to find a method to articulate better  Slower talking  faster talking  More enthusiasm or less  Lower or higher tone pitch  Specifically when I want to come off as serious  
Yeah I'm on the same boat  I've had a really bad few weeks and 2017 won't change anything lol 
I never have  There doesn't seem to be a point to it  just another shitty year  
If Prozac doesn't seem to be helping then  I highly recommend you talk to your doc  If it was a random incident then  that's perfectly normal  Medications like Prozac isn't a fix but  rather a band aid  Therapy would help aid in recovery  For many meds like Prozac won't stop panic attacks altogether but  will help minimize the amount of times they happen and the intensity of them  
Yeah  it's part of why I quit doing the whole New Years celebration thing  Seemed pointless to celebrate getting the chance to live through a whole new year's worth of pain and suffering with even less chance of it getting better than I had last year  since 1  I'm another year older in a country that views getting old as basically a poor life choice that you should have planned to avoid  and 2  the incoming administration has  as its campaign platform  the stated goal of working directly over the next 4 8 years to make the lives of people in my demographic  poor  aging  but still impregnably female  among other things  ongoingly more miserable  scary and painful than it already is

In order to start "owning" yourself and your mental health again  it is super important to get back on medication and finding therapy  I have gone through various forms of treatments  psychotherapy  general ralking  specialist rape counsellings   If i am honest  taking therapy is the best one to start with  expecially with a specialist service if you can find it  Its extremely therapeutic being able to express on the "secret" flashbacks  nightmares  trauma you have had  From there  when you are feeling a bit more comfortable with expressing things  Interventiom therapy is essential  Anxiety  management  CBT and perhaps addiction help  if relevant  can really beneficial   EMDR was the absolutely brilliant though  It got rid of a series of nightmares flasbacks  triggers in one session  So i highly rate that   Overall  yes things can get better  but you need to put the work in too  And you are putting that work in   Unfortunately the world wont reach out to help you  We are all too blinded by our own insecurities  But there is help out there  Just keep pushing for it  always   Sorry for the tangent  Best of luck too you xx    Also sorry for the spelling grammer mistakes  I hate my phone and fat fingers  
Hah well so long as the cat helps it's good 3 what's up 
Ugh  I'm so sorry you had to go through that  it's just the worst feeling in the world     What I came to realize after talking to some of my extroverted friends is that they're not even aware of how difficult and upsetting this can be for some of us  It's usually nothing personal  socializing comes so naturally to them that it doesn't occur to them someone is totally freaking out in the same situation   still feels really shitty  though    Thanks for replying  I hope your year turns out to be great despite its lousy start 
Haven't had New Years plans in years  I understand your pain  It sucks and you're not alone 
If you live in the UK depression is classified as a disability if you have it for over 9 months  Not sure about elsewhere
Oh  I sure hope it gets better 
  You have people  No  I don't 
Same here  It's harder for me since I'm a college dropout and my job doesn't have any good environment
I feel the same way 
I'm still struggling with feeling so tired all the time  I'm still practicing mindfulness  taking my new medication  not binge eating  I'm really working hard at getting "better" and forcing myself to do all the menial but necessary tasks I would rather not  I just  I dunno  I hope all of my efforts one day pay off because I want to experience what life has to offer  Happy New Year everyone   
I put a few typos in my essay that i sent to a few colleges and I still got in  They were well respected state schools  Unless it's seriously egregious  I wouldn't worry  I freaked about the same exact thing lmao   If you didnt get in it wasnt the essay  trust me on that 
Its just that we dont know how to love  so it just ends up hurting us
What are his symptoms 
You have to define what depression is  you don't have to say that you are this or that  but you can admit that you're suffering   A lot of people I see on here are either had a traumatic experience that has affected them in one way or cannot help but suffer in life  even if nothing is wrong  just their chemistry is messed up  constant pain no matter what    Though  there are others that can't get their way  maybe a relationship problem or they aren't fulfilling their desires  of course  they get depressed  but in my opinion  I don't think they can truly relate to the above 
I would love to be comfortable on a dance floor  and particularly around women in that situation      Over the last year I've been really getting into techno and house music  which I find to be pure bliss in its own right  And I'm learning and collecting the necessary equipment to make it myself  and that's something I feel very confident about and would never think twice about if I was "good enough " if that makes sense  I mean I haven't even produced a whole song yet  but I don't have any serious doubts about my capacity for it and I'm super happy to know that 2017 will be the year I start releasing music for public consumption    But then on the flip side  I'm having a really tough time getting out of the anxiety loops I put myself into whenever I go to music events  For all of my musical ability  I have a disappointingly poor 0  natural talent with dancing  I've actively avoided dancing my entire life  but now all of a sudden  my love for EDM means it comes along with this horrible obligation  And it's like I hate myself when I see all these beautiful girls waiting for someone to dance with and I pretend not to notice and just withdraw from the situation  but I also fucking hate myself when I start dancing around people and they either actually laugh at me or I imagine that that must be what's happening  and I know that both regularly happen which makes it tricky   And it's weird because on one hand I have 0 interest in dancing so in theory it shouldn't matter to me that I can't do it  but on the other  I don't want to deprive myself of the amazing music and the opportunity to meet incredibly enticing women just because of my social anxiety   Tl Dr  I'm a remarkably bad dancer despite my musical interests normally associated with dancing  I want to learn how to dance and how to be comfortable while doing it  so that I'm not missing out on the great opportunities in my life
It sucks  it really does  Not only have I not been delt a bad hand  but I've actually had so many opportunities to take advantage of that some people would only dream of  Yet I'm still stuck with the same state of mind  It's like I don't deserve to be happy  but I also don't deserve to be depressed  as weird or ironic as that may sound 
Maybe that's the factor that will break the log jam for me being excessively self conscious  Thanks for sharing your experience
Hapiness normally comes with small acts or activities that makes you feel alive inside  I'm glad you shared your experience and I hope 2017 will bring you more of these  D
i honestly feel the same
The ironic thing is  for the very same reasons  leaving the US is quickly becoming something many of us born here may have to do in order to survive  I know if they dismantle the ACA  I'm going to have to try and find way to emigrate to a place with socialized health care if I ever want a real chance at having access to health care outside of an ER ever again  I just looked at what the cost of my crappy " 3000 per person annual deductible  and then we only cover 70  of what comes after that" policy would cost without the subsidy  and it's like  1500 a month  And that's  with  the price break that comes from the mandate and includes all the preventive  no cost care the ACA requires  Might as well be a million bucks  since there's no way I could ever afford that  And come Jan 7  the new administration has promised to start gutting the program of the very things that make it affordable to anyone who isn't already in the upper income levels  And likely ripping out the required preventive no cost coverage  too  since that's a core ACA component 
I'll take a look at that later   What do you think about a session of gaming with me  I'm depressed too and need a good match to relax    
Actually it seems i may have been mistaken  it seems that 16 is the age of medical consent rather than confidentiality  and it's still possible to get treatment without parental consent in some cases  http   www fpa org uk factsheets under 16s consent confidentiality You may also want to contact childline if you're parents are abusing mistreating you or you feel that they will be incapable of adequately supporting your mental health
How do you define "seriously egregious"  It's not like I just misspelled a word or something 
I haven't got help been suffering for few years I want to get help too because I'm just getting worse and worse too it's not just going to go away
Good for you
So true  I get so much more work done when I'm at the library  I think knowing that I would have wasted time if I left without getting work done is what keeps me on track 
I don't even have the first part anymore 
Couldn't of said it better than that 
Why the fuck is everyone on my instagram feed partying celebrating  I don't get it 
Father was killed in November  mom has been spiraling out of control since  She confessed to me about her plans for suicide back from before my father was killed  She still doesn't know about the two times I tried to kill myself    The holidays were once again excruciatingly lonely and I still wear my happy family mask almost everyday through these months    New years was a fresh glimpse into my self loathing  I got a ride from a very important person in my life  This was nice  except that I was my usual self and feel like I pushed this person further away  I've spent every moment analyzing everything I said and did around this person last night  and all I can feel is shame and embarrassment  and sympathy for that person    Been laying in bed all day today  Haven't moved or had anything to eat or drink  January 1st 2017 would be a pretty good last day on Earth   if I could actually do it  
I feel the same as you do mate  and it's a perpetuating cycle  You feel depressed  then guilty because you feel you shouldn't be depressed  then depressed about the fact that you fee guilty    As  u Hgf123 said  there is no objective measure  you feel what you feel  I'm going to expand on this a little because it's how I can articulate my own concerns   There are starving people all over the world  yet a lot of us can afford to eat lavishly  Should we feel guilt about that fact we've all probably said 'I'm starving' when there really are starving people in the world  No  because contextually we exist in totally different paradigms of hunger  You shouldn't be made to feel guilty because you live in an environment in which food is readily available  A moment can be spent thinking of those with issues  causes can be pursued  injustice felt  but guilt in this situation is baseless  I feel the same about depression  Someone may have lost limbs  parents  squirrel's  you never know  and that has driven them to deep depression  You just woke up and you're depressed  Again  contextually  what causes your depression is a totally seperate paradigm  Just because someone has been through 'real' trauma does not make them more entitled to being called depressed  Personally I know my depression started long before I had any real trauma in my life  and even after the many years of hell I put myself through I still don't feel like I'm worthy of being depressed  But I can't help the fact that I'm in pain all the time  I struggle with so very much  and I shouldn't need to feel guilty because I never lost an ear fighting the Spartans  I know I trivialise a little       Sorry  such a ramble  Basically  it's all about context  We feel things because of our context and we can't compare our feelings to someone that has lived in a totally different context to us   I hope this has made sense and helps a bit  Sorry if not  I've taken my sleeping pills which make me a bit funny  but I couldn't help but post because  like I said  I often feel the same 
Better than Heroin i suppose 
I would say change in subject matter from what you were trying to say or just a metric shitton of typos all over the essay   If that's that case I would say to try and email call the admissions office and ask if you can change the essay 
That's the plan for sure

I take it that you've been reading online about side effects  Wellbutrin is fairly safe in general  No one here can accurately tell you how you will respond to it unless you try it out  Honestly the fear anxiety from "side effects" is worse than  any actual side effects you might experience in real life good chance you won't experience side effects at all not everyone does  just take it with good faith and see how it works out for you  If for whatever reason you have concerns while taking the medication  call your doc and explain what is going on  
They're trying to distract themselves from the fact that they and everyone they know are completely insignificant 
I feel the same bud  I just posted a reply on the other message you posted on  Have a read  maybe it will make a bit of sense to you   https   www reddit com r depression comments 5lfo84 i feel like im not even entitled to call myself 
Again  define metric shitton  I have 4 in a 30 word essay  No idea how the hell they all slipped through 
You're still a person  You're going through a hell of a tough time but you can get through it  You don't need to remember how to act as a human  as you get better you'll do it intrinsically 
 removed 
hey man  i hope you change your plans on that  im rooting for you
Well said
Good for you  You should definitely be proud of yourself  Doing my hair is hard for me  I get to the point of consistent tossing it in a bun and not giving too shits  Thanks for the encouragement to make a goal like that for myself 
Very appropriate username    
I remember that post  I didn't reply back then  but looking over your comment I wish I had looked further  This is going to be one very  very big bulk of text but please read from beginning to end   I'm 23 just like you  And 23 years ago  people found out from the get go that I was a bit    different  I didn't interact socially much  and kept to myself a lot  The diagnosis came pretty quickly  autism   Now  my family fortunately did a good job at handling it  So while my childhood wasn't perfect whose is   it was pretty damn nice  and slowly  bit by bit  I managed to get more social  So at the end of childhood I had a few friends  And a good piece of news came  for freshman middle school I would be put in the same class as two of my friends from elementary   And they started to bully me  Those two 'friends' of mine   So  this destroyed me mentally and emotionally  and since I was already disoriented all the time thanks to my autism  I closed myself up  I became frozen  And although I did get in another class the year after  I didn't dare opening up  In that same class I managed to do a bit better grade wise though  This made sure that I would be put in a higher level course next  The reason I was the most happy about this was because I could get into an environment without those bullies  So I tried opening up again   And I got bullied  Again   This made me 'reconfirm' the negative self image of myself  which was initially taught by two of my 'friends'  So all of my years of middle high school one thing in the Netherlands  were complete hell   To top that all of  I also got kicked out of college once  This happened because I had to do an internship  but the company I did my internship at wasn't suited for someone like me  who has a form of autism  Internship got terminated  I got a lesser quality  degree  and with no experience and it being the middle of the recession no one wanted to hire me  No one   Now  a few years later I'm studying physics  And I've finished an internship overseas  in the US  And I worked alongside an internationally  well known project within particle physics  I've also made a lot of good friends through the years  So all is going well    And I STILL wish that it was better    But you know what  That's natural  To want things to be better is only natural  Like you  I'm 23  and still don't have a relationship for example  That sucks  You see everyone already  having or having multiple relationships and you still don't  In my circle of friends there are only a few left with no relationship experience  Even though I'm one of the older ones     Still  in my opnion it's important to accept where you are  and not where you should be  It's all right if you're not all right 
Do you get some dots in your mouth that hurt like hell after a few days of brushing 
Sounds nice  What are you playing 
I am the same way   
Of course  that's the best way to keep forward   
Huh  That happens to me sometimes  It feels like i have boobs  like a pressure on my chest and then i touch my chest to make sure I don't want boobs  Thankfully it's not as serious as my HOCD 
I really like that classic image with the dolphin  "i wanna die"   Puts a smile on my face 
Keep pushing yourself bro  best of luck   
Like literally 2 3 typos in every sentence   Mind if you try and describe some of the typos  I've been going through your post history and i made the same sort of errors in my essay that I sent to a few schools  missing words  replacing words with totally different ones  etc  As long as you think it gets the message across  you're fine  Calm down  and if you're really that worried call or email your universities tomorrow and see if they will accept another one  As others have said  if you didn't get in  it definitely wasn't becasue of some typos  They  won't throw away a student's body of work due to a few typos 
Since you feel like you no reason to love yourself you can't grasp the idea of someone loving you 
Yes  and my dad is a doctor so I'm fairly well versed in things like that  I took the first 100mg today  nothing to report except for I feel like I'm on speed 
Hoping for the best for you 
Thank you very much for your response  I understand what you mean by managing working hours   Honestly  I would not even mind working the long hours if I at least knew what I was doing half the time during those hours  The biggest part of my supposed anxiety and dredd comes from the inherent contradiction that I am floundering and scraping by without really knowing what I am doing truly  I know that's what learning on the job is for  but I feel there is never enough time for that to happen properly for my learning pace   Therefore I fear my work  fear I am doing something wrong  and keep putting it off because I don't think I even have the capabilities to do it appropriately    But I guess if everyone had the capabilities right away  the job wouldn't be a professional career job   I think I may just not be interested or passionate in the subject material I am dealing with to motivate me to do self learning on my own time  
I made it about a year off meds before shit got real and I crashed REALLY REALLY hard and ended up back in the hospital  Good luck 
Eh if you wanna talk to someone pm me  I ain't doing much and I'm a very tolerant person  If we have some similar interests we can chill and talk about that  Up to you I don't mind just doing muh thing over here 
Same 
Well first things first  you and I certainly won't be here to experience this  neither will your children or your grandchildren or even their children  Second of all  think how far science has progressed over the last few years  It's insane  Sure there are still terrible diseases in the world that we haven't found the cure to  but think how far science could come by the time you and I are in our 60s or 70s  I'm assuming you're not that old  Haha  Perhaps we may find a way to "save the world" or even find a new planet with similar conditions as Earth and we move there  I think Prof  Stephen Hawking said something like "For humanity to carry on  we would need to find a new planet" and humans are great when faced with adversity  If we all came together  all the smartest minds come together to figure out how to save the human race  bare in mind this will be years and years away   and I wouldn't be surprised if ideas are already been thrown around haha  But perhaps there is technology that hasn't been invented yet that could help  I mean if you were to say to someone in the 80s that everyone will walk around with small telephones that can connect you with everyone in the world  I mean that's crazy  But here we are  here I am talking to you   So try not to worry  no offence but it's out of your hands and out of my hands  Focus on yourself and what you can control 
It's really hard to explain people who don't understand the feeling  Makes it feel even worse  
Ok  Honestly I have inferiority complex from me  and sometimes my parents  comparing myself to my sister  This makes it really hard for me to ask for help  I've started asking for help  but swallowing pride is a challenge    But I will try harder  Thank you very much     
Yeah  I wrote the sentance "The challenges can about virtually subject" when I was trying to say "The challenges ca   be   about virtually   any   subject "  The most minor one here  I said "other players works" instead of work  just a small issue not too worried about that one   And then I said "I love the intellectual native of these round" as opposed to   nature     I appreciate your support  Really 
Thou hast journey'd far  and overcome much  chosen Undead  Come hither  child    Stop lying to yourself  I'm sure you're not unwanted
i live in the US  it's considered a disability but if you can't show up to a job they don't really care why 
Oh yeah Wellbutrin does have a super a stimulating feeling for many  I also felt the same when I first took it  I didn't take it for depression anxiety but for ADD  There's other options better suited for depression than just taking Wellbutrin alone  Wellbutrin is often used in conjunction with other anti depressants  Wellbutrin is often prescribed to help combat the lethargic feeling from AD's    helps with loss of libido also caused by AD's  
My goals are to wake up early  be grateful for everyday  acknowledge negative thoughts and know that they wont get me  and change the way I look at interacting with people and work on enjoying it  
Depression   Seriously  I never felt truly happy ever till I got on medication 
My take on Lamictal  "Primarily useful for convincing your pdoc to prescribe you something actually helpful "  My take on Latuda  "There's an antipsychotic that improves my mood and treats my psychosis without making me fat  stupid  tired  or generally miserable   Slap me  I must be dreaming "  Sorry your mom didn't tell you  that's kinda shitty of her    How bipolar has affected me  I went from an ENTP who wanted to make a career mathematically modelling human behavior to an ENFP who wants to make a career helping people cope with their emotions as a therapist  I also decided to find out a lot about neuroscience and psychiatric drugs   I've learned what meds help most for what symptoms  what risks are safer to take and which to never take  I've learned it's important to talk about your feelings  but also that it's important for that that talking happen with people you trust  I've definitely come to appreciate the importance of taking care of myself better as I've aged  Idk  If you have more specific questions I'm happy to do my best to answer them  I'm 27  diagnosed  January 2010  and on Latuda and Lamictal  among others  
I'm less affected by it when I'm drunk  But  when the alcohol wears off  there is hell to pay  
I find that this feeling of being an outsider doesn't go away even when I am participating in things  since I can only ever go through the motions and essentially fake it  So I'm there physically  but just as disconnected on an emotional level as I ever was  
I've gotten my doctor to write a note to my college so my professors were lenient on my attendance  but i don't think the job i have would care whether or not i was depressed  just if i showed up  i agree that just going is easier but it's really hard for me to even get the motivation to get ready at all  especially if it's in the morning  I'm perfectly fine in the evening  My advisor had to scheduled my classes next semester to later times so i would actually go  i don't live on campus   Depression just sucks all around  Glad your husband supports you like he does 
That sucks  Is your boss the understanding type 
it just seems so dumb  like nothing really means anything to anyone anymore 
I think I feel kind of similar to you right now  For me I feel scared to get professional help but at the same time know there is no real alternative considering how deep into depression I am  If you feel the same maybe we could encourage eachother  I have no real advice that you probably haven't heard before 
i'll be moving out in a year so i'll be sure to do that asap  for now though i live in a small town with not much to do and not many people to meet 
I went through something that's somewhat similar  What I ended up finding out is that she was so stressed at her new job and she was stressed at home  So she would shut down sexually and emotionally  So I took it upon myself to make sure she's at the very least not as stressed when she's home  I cleaned daily  cooked  made sure we had everything stocked like food cleaning stuff and I got her to join me on some light exercise like walks and body weight exercises  I also tried to get her to talk about what stressed her out about the work day  I basically made sure she can come home and just relax as much as possible and do little as possible  I also took a step back with the sexual stuff    After a while she was feeling much better  Her intimacy also came back and it was better than ever  Plus I got her into exercising so she's also healthier now  
Racism exists  Homophobia exists  So  Both of those things I have to experience first hand and experience all the issues from that  Being a straight white man you have better chances than me though   Thank you for the reply though  
 What's the quickest I can titrate lamictal without dying   The speed at which your doctor tells you  You are asking for medical advice that no one here is qualified to give  The risk of SJS might be quantifiable  but it's also highly variable and there are genes that affect risk levels   Lamictal is supposed to help a little with depression  but is more useful for preventing episodes  okay  specifically worded as "reducing the frequency of " which to me is the same thing  than treating them  Most people don't think they're bipolar at first  Usually those people still benefit from medication 
i'm just starting to grow up  still have more than a year till i move out though  side note  are you a writer  you seem like you'd be a good writer 
I feel defeated
Exactly what i was thinking  You think it's gone for a few days and it comes back to hit even harder 
This made me want to replay the first Dark Souls    
And this might cheer you up  I love this song    https   youtu be buqtdpuZxvk
In a nutshell when you let anxiety consume you  you're basically fighting yourself  Sad to say there is no easy fix  One useful thing that I do is to practice mindfulness  If you take a step back and think about it  Panic can make you believe the world is gonna come crumbling down but  count how many times all your worries and fears actually came true  If you're like me   i can't count any because none of what's going on in my head has actually happened  You got this and you can pass your drivers test 
You should
You'd have to do what I do everyday for that to happen
Most of my neighbors don't know me  and I think the ones who do are busy watching television etc       There were some dogs which barked  but they seem to be indoors for the colder weather     I suppose if you have transportation  you might be able to go to a park  and walk something more scenic  with strangers   
I can't give you any tips since I'm in the same boat but I wish you good luck   
You're not alone  this feels terrible  When you're in debt and lost everything  We'll sort it out i'm sure 
Are meds really that worth it  I'm depressed too  
When I saw the title I thought oh we're our own race of Depressed people
Thank you so much    How do you stop yourself repanicking after mindfullness  Or do the effects last a long time for you 
Sounds like anhedonia  Could be dysthymia   But hey  don't  rely on the internet for diagnoses   You're in Norway  so you've got decent healthcare  right  Ask a psychologist  an MD  whatever sort of experts you can afford   Your problem could be psychological  hormonal  etc  All I can do is guess 
I've been trying to cut off caffeine but I'm really addicted to soda since my junior year of high school  Send help  Sophmore in college

So glad you posted this because I feel like I need help   I spent New Years alone  I was in the house with my grandparents  but still  I didnt have an SO  And being on Facebook  Instagram seeing everyone with their SOs having a great night and 3 of my best friends all in relationships and me single  its tough  I always find this time of the year hard when I see everyone with someone and me alone   Im soon to be 29 too and the thought of being single when Im 30 is not nice  I just want to be with someone and be happy  I do have options but  Im not attracted to the options I do have otherwise Id just settle and be with them   Can anyone help  Thanks 
Thanks for sharing  It's beautiful 
I could care less if you have depression  Just don't be an asshole  I don't want to be in a relationship with an asshole guy  
Oh  good  glad you were able to talk with a college counselor  You are probably not the first student she's had with anxiety depression  I agree that taking fewer classes is wise  you don't want to overload yourself with credits  especially your first semester back 
i dunno man  take it easy   
His favorite spot is his bed  sleeping problems  irritability  social isolation  and has gained 40kg since he lost his last job 10 y o 
That's exciting   So happy for you    I hope you continue to improve 
It's just not worth it  
Right  This isn't a new topic for me lol   I do know that I enjoy stimulants  rave music  and feeling comfortable around other people  so it's kinda crazy I haven't tried it yet
im proud of you buddy  its the little things that can mean a whole lot  keep it up    
I wish you good luck with it  Even if it is hard  there is nothing to loose     Let us know how your 2017 is going 
Me too  Spent NYE sober for this reason 
Could one learn to be depressed just to justify their laziness   Subconsciously of course
This is something that you need to deal with first before you get back with her or jump straight back into a relationship  Otherwise youre just going to keep self sabotaging your own happiness and why  For what   I felt like this and I wish I could say this is how I made it stop but I guess its different for everyone  For me  she was my world  my number one priority  but to her  I was just some guy she was dating  So I invested more than she did  Eventually I started caring less and less  focusing on myself  Seeing my friends and keeping busy  Thats the key I think  keeping yourself busy and seeing friends   family  When youre alone doing nothing  thats when your mind wanders and its never a good thing  at least in my experience   So go to the gym  be the best version of yourself possible  Learn a new language  read a book  take up a sport  find a new hobby  Something anything   But also  seek help  I started talking to a therapist and some of the stuff he suggested to me really has helped  I also saw my doctor who gave me some anti depressants to help    The help is out there  you just need to take advantage of it and dont let your negative thoughts about your past relationship or who you are as a person define you  Its all a lie  youre an amazing  beautiful person who does deserve her and someone even better  
I lost all my friends this year  so no  I don't celebrate anything anymore 
I also had hobbies before and interests two was reading and science but yeah I feel you I just don't have the energy to Dean with those things now  Even music which used to always make me happy even for just a few seconds just makes me ten times more sad and disgusted with myself  The putting on the mask in front of others is me every single day 
Thanks  I've already ask my mother to book an appointment with my doctor to see if maybe there's something else we can do  In the meantime  I'm gonna be hella busy tomorrow with all the work that I haven't been able to finish yet  So I'll need that good luck  and I wish the same to you
Yeah  I know that feeling  Someone once described it to me as feeling like you're carrying a hundred pounds on your back while all those other people are carrying a thousand   But really  it's not everyone else who matters  it's YOU  If you notice that you're feeling like shit  it's more than okay to get someone to help you carry that weight 
150  yes  Once you find the right one you will feel 10 000  better  I feel so much more clear  mood swings don't happen often  I'm not over sleeping  I don't sit on the couch or lay in bed all day most days  I don't lose interest in things all the time  I can feel my happiness  I can simply feel myself be happy without the foggy ness making me feel less  The day I realized my medication kicked in I cried because my emotions weren't dulled down being forced into the gray area I felt pure happiness for the first time probably in my life and I was just so happy 
Your thoughts and emotions are stronger than anything else  It seems hard which trust me    I know that it is  but the moment you don't let panic set in and practice mindfulness   it's long term effects can last forever  Seems crazy to think that you control panic right  I thought so at first  Something my therapist told me and I believe in it now   the more energy you put into something panic  the stronger it'll become  The thing that keeps a panic attack going is sometimes also due to your breathing  the whole cliche of deep breaths and control your breathing does in fact have meaning  
I'm 35 and for what it's worth i'm in the aame boat   Every time there's a holiday i'm reminded of all the fun others get to have with one another and how alone and hopeless i always felt since i was a boy   If it's any comfort you have a 12 year head start on me and i didnt have all the online communities to reach out to for support back then   Meetup is great  Tinder only makes me feel depressed and more worthless   When going to a meetup ask yourself why it is tou're really going   Is it out of desperation or are you pursuing something that will help you grow   ie  learning a new skill or playing a game that will be engaging  etc 
I think that it is when you have the explanation why something is wrong  things that once felt wrong are now explained  What I mean is that when I was younger  many things did not feel normal   Too many nightmares as a kid  random fears  not being able to "fit in" as a teenager   altough this one is common amongst teens    constant fear  but idealisation of death  mood swings     Once I was certain that I had depression  it all made sense  I always kind of knew something was wrong  but now it could be explained 
I just wanted to make space for the sequels     T                                                                               
Don't let it get you too down  I know it's not easy  I was made fun of by my whole family growing up  I learned not to trust people  if my family is like this what are normal people like  I isolated myself and got deeper into my SA    I talk to my family a few times a year  you're not alone    
Everything in my life is OK but I don't feel this way My mom still making fun of me in front of people  blaming me for her lack of money Everytime I'm alone I go in a really dark place     Everyday is a struggle  I can't really breath  I'm fighting to not start over my bad habits 3 months clean Not doing great at all 
I've tried Effexor XR and unfortunately it caused a lot of stomach upset  But thanks for sharing 
Life tends to be living life on edge  I suffer from Generalised Anxiety Disorder  so life tends to feel exhausting    You know that feeling when you miss a step or you lean too far back in your chair  Imagine that  having that little mini heart attack out of the blue every day  The constant worrying and "What if " You physically feel tense because of this constant worrying  you feel tired and fatigued    Other than the grey skies and rain  anxiety brings  there are few moments of peace and you truly appreciate those moments in life  Moments you can relax  even if those moments are very short and not as frequent as you like   So  over a long term  anxiety does feel as if a little gremlin is sat on your shoulder waiting to strike  But you become familiar to the cycles of anxiety and depression  slowly get better at controlling it  There are days where anxiety does overwhelm you with a combination with depression  Overall  life feels as if you're falling  but it just takes a few moments to realise you're firmly stood on the ground    
Wow  I can relate a lot to you  I feel like I have no purpose in life other than being a parasite and it makes me suicidal  Why live if I have no purpose  I don't have any friends and will never have and I can't even make friends  do you expect me to find a gf  Ha  what a joke  Everytime I log on any social media all I see are happy people  and it makes me feel like shit  I HAD people I called friends but I just fucked shit up and now I'm alone  The only thing that keeps me alive is the fact that I know my family will suffer with my suicide  but more in a financial way than a sentimental one 
I'm about to turn 15 and I feel the same way  Thankfully nobody has told me to spend so much time on my PC in a long time  My mom says that I'm better off sitting here in my room all day  rather than what some other kids are already doing like drinking alcohol  smoking etc 
We are all special  Nobody should allow an illness or a disease to define them as a person  Your personality  your character defines you as a person   Youre low at the moment which is understandable but you need to snap out of it  This way of thinking isnt helping  its feeding negative thoughts which can be dangerous   Im guessing your British since youre studying at a university  Im British too  if you ever want to chat  hit me up  But seek help  I saw my GP and they referred me to a therapist  CBT which is helping and also anti depressants  Im not sure if you can take them given your situation  But do you take any meds for your problems  If not  go see your doctor to sort you some out    Also  diet is key  if youre eating bad then that wont help your illness  the better you eat  the better youll feel  I know  its hard  believe me  but after the first couple days itll be easier to do   I think also  since its a new year you need a game plan  Focus on yourself and progress within yourself  what would you like to do  Would you like to get in a relationship  Then start thinking about ideas of how you want to do that  theres someone for everyone despite your situation   Do you want a new job or a new hobby  Have a think about what interests you    And dont be afraid to reach out to friends and family  they love you  they care about you and thats what theyre there for  Thats what friends are for  Dont worry  youll have their back one day     
wot rings u got bithc Well unless you have a 100 gb hdd    you done goofed
I want to try Lexapro again  but the last time I tried it  I never made it through the side effects  My stomach is very sensitive with the SSRIs  and I'm not sure how to combat that   EDIT  I've tried ADs  which i'm on now   I take remeron  but it doesn't seem to do anything for my anxiety  The only reason i'm on it still is because without it I wouldn't have an appetite   SSRIs  SNRIs  Anti psychotics and Mood Stabilizers 
Hey  15 too  I'm here if you ever need to talk or vent 
being lonely is shit
I'm going to give it a go and hopefully won't mess up on Tuesday  You've saved me 
I don't even believe things will get better anymore
If you're going to abandon her anyway there's no need to kill yourself to do that  Otherwise you should consider if you can raise the child or are willing to put it up for adoption  Otherwise an abortion might be your only option 
You're not a pedophile if you are repulsed by the thoughts  They are unwanted  They do not  turn you on    This is really common with OCD  just look online  
Definitely both  most of the times the first one causes the second one  A lot of depressed people are the ones  usually introverts  who are smarter  have an artistic vision or just analyze everything or think too much  all of them at times causing isolation and depression  and when they get depressed they can't help but keep on thinking much  It's really a fucked up cycle isn't it  
Yep and this further proves my point that people only use you then cast you aside when you need help
I spent the entire evening worried about how we're gonna afford groceries after paying rent and bills  I didn't share this with her so I was just this solemn melancholy ass all night    
Thank you so much for your thoughtful reply  It means a lot that people spend time helping those in need  even on Reddit   Your story makes a lot of sense  and actually sounds a bit like my own  I get what you're saying about fixing myself first  and I know that has to be a priority right now It's just so hard because I'm a fixer so I want things to just get better  I know you are right though  there needs to be a series of events  I need to learn from patterns of behavior in the past   You gave some really solid advice  and I will say that I'm talking to a therapist and I'm back on medication  Toward the end of each day I'm usually feeling way more confident about myself  but it's like the clock resets every night and I wake up in the morning with no motivation because it doesn't feel like I'm working towards anything significant  Have you experienced this too  
Replace it with seltzer water with fruit  That's what I did  Soda is ridiculously bad for you and your anxiety  I noticed huge improvements when I cut it 
 I guess I need someone to reassure me  This is not what you need  You already know the truth  seeking reassurance just strengthens the cycle of worrying 
This is exactly what I said last year    and   the year before  on New Years Eve  Nothing is going to change  
It's sad  They don't seem to care whether people get health care or not  One of my cousins has type 1 diabetes and even with good insurance it's costly   I don't have health insurance so I haven't been to a doctor in a couple years  I can't afford to see a counselor therapist   I believe the outcome of this election has made depression worse for some  It's scary  
Abortion is the ONLY option here  It's better for both of you and the child  You're already posting here on a depression sub  do you really feel like you're capable of raising another human being  that child is gonna grow up and feel like shit because his her parents never wanted him her  It's the most wrong thing to do from depressed people to have a child  Please tell your girlfriend to abort it and save yourself all the drama  suicide is not an option since you can end all this pain with a medical alternate  stay focused and strong dude  it'll pass  
Sounds like we certainly have something in common  haha  I'm sorry things are shitty  You say you feel like a parasite  but also that your family relies on you financially  At least if you are contributing to them financially  you are not really a parasite at all  Maybe your friends can forgive you for whatever it is that happened  I don't know your story  but I know your pain  
As I would love to be off the benzos  I unfortunately can't get off them until my pdoc finds a medicine that will work for me   
I know its tough thinking about this  but don't think the worst   If you've been a good employee  this should  at worst  be a warning  assuming there's not more going on than we know about   When he talks to you  tell him you had your phone off to allow yourself to relax and recharge during your time off  and that you responded to him when you got the message   Tell him that if he has critical tasks  he shouldn't rely on a text message to deliver them   If he brings up 'attitude' problems  tell him you were under stress and exhausted before Christmas  and that you're sorry if it appeared that you were having a bad attitude 
OCD 101   intrusive thought       anxiety         validates fear         repeat   The thoughts will not stop at the beginning  that's beyond your control  You need to train the metaphysical side of you to not give a fuck and not confirm your obsession  You're brain will feel tense and your muscles will spasm because it feels so odd not to respond  But you'll gradually build your tolerance and in a week  you'll be astonished by the evolution of your mind  It's not complicated  It's precisely how people normal people respond to intrusive thoughts  and how you respond to topics impartial to your OCD   For example  you see an extremely attractive guy at the market  You probably imagine him naked and going at it next to the frozen pizza  But that's absurd  it's obviously not going to happen hahaha  So you think of the most rational response to get his attention  if you're on the prowl   start a conversation  initiate eye contact  etc  But what if you were afraid that it was going to happen  Convinced that you guys will start fucking right then and there  and that people would see or you'd get arrested  Hopefully  from your perspective  that'd be a little extreme   But unfortunately  that's exactly what's happening in your circumstance  You're thinking about a man not in the room  whom you've ended intimacy with  and have had a enough time to process the depression  But yet you are convincing yourself that you can't let go  Of course  it feels like you need to  But it's merely an illusion of the intrusive thoughts you fuel with anxiety    you got this 
Anxiety has a list of "symptoms" rapid heart rate  lump in throat feeling  numb tingling feeling in arm legs face and head  difficulty talking  slurring  dizziness  cold feeling   hot flashes and the list just goes on and on  Although ALS is a serious issue   if you're prone to anxiety  the likelihood of it being ALS is slim to non existent  If you truly believe you might have ALS  set up an appt to have a talk with your doc  IMO I wouldnt suggest going down that road because  again  if you're prone to anxiety testing for something like ALS is pricey with no insurance  If you have insurance then take full advantage of it  A simple yet effective test that I was given was to take a simple test dose of a benzodiazepine  If will almost instantly help stop any physical feelings as well as mental "symptoms" of anxiety  If it doesn't then it would be a good idea to make an appt with a doc  
People forget to mention mental disorders fall on a spectrum  If you're on the extreme end  regular meds are absolutely required  The brain is completely unable to reliably regulate its own activity  so it must rely on pills to do the job for it  Kind of similar to type 1 diabetes   So  do you need meds  You can't rely on others' opinions  You have to rely on your own personal evaluation of your situation  with the help of a good pdoc   Some people need pills 24 7  Others only need it during winter  and major life events  Others only need it during severe life changing events    I believe the more severe sufferers frequent this subreddit  since they need more group support  and therefore you will see a lot of "You have to take your meds every day "  Whether you need meds 24 7  or not  you need to find and keep a good pdoc     for regular checkups  and in case of emergencies   I can't stress the "good" part enough  There are an alarming number of bad pdocs  including the ones who don't care  and therefore fail you in your time of extreme need 
I'm starting CBT this month and I'm super excited to see how it helps  I've heard a ton of good things from people on here and friends who have done it  This year I'm going to be less passive about my anxieties and push more to take control rather than be controlled 
Think of it like this  I hate myself when I do just anythung  The only thing I know how to do is absolutely nothing 
When I wanted to hang myself because I didn't see the point in life  Still don't see a point 
Yeah  quite tempted to see a doc about it  But even now  that I've calmed down a bit and have looked at the ALS incidence rate I kind of realise now that it was likely anxiety as I don't have any of the symptoms at the moment  But thanks

for many years i was denying to call my troubles depression because i believed it was a part of who i am  I thought it's part of my identity  to drown in swamps of gloom and anxiety  Besides after bad day next one was ok ish so  it's normal me not an illness  I was so afraid medication will alternate my personality  Currently i am also heavy medicated  but i understand now  that depression was the one alternating my personality  Drugs didn't made me fully normal but i am more myself than without them  Turns out controlling sadness every second and suppressing all emotions is not part of my nature  But i still feel guilty calling myself depressed  is it just bad stigma of mental illness and overusing depression to describe any crying spells in one  I feel guilty even to try to say I understand you or that I am in similar state  even if in my mind formulates the same sentences of confusion on who am I  Only thing I am sure about is  depression is not part of my integrity and I deserve a pill a day to maintain my individualism  I am with you in looking for understanding where do I belong  
New Years is always my worst day  I spend it alone  I cry  I shake  I give in to my anxiety  I break down  The next day  I always think  "Maybe this year will treat me better"   Then  on the first day of the year  I am always reminded why I want to commit suicide  
When i get her back im going to PM you  Im not giving up  She's my girl  
Hi  Thank you for such a long and thoughtful reply     I am not taking any medications for my anxiety  I also have a phobia of medication  or more specifically  having an allergic reaction to medications   I tried Cipralex in the summer  but possibly  had a reaction  The doctors said it's impossible to know if it was a real reaction or just my anxiety  but to stop the meds just in case      I am on a medication for my acid reflux  which usually does help  I also have really bad IBS   it runs in my family  Ugh    Right now I just ate a few pieces of vegetarian sushi for dinner and I'm already freaking out  It's like as soon as it gets dark  I can't function anymore  It really helps knowing that other people have gone through something similar  and have improved   I also feel like nausea vomiting is worse than death  I also have contemplated death during especially bad bouts of nausea  I'm so frustrated right now 
Sometimes yes  Not sure why either 
Very fucked up 
Sorry  I can't help with the age thing  I'm only eighteen myself  and I was diagnosed a few months ago   The three drugs I've tried so far are Latuda  Tegretol  and Lamictal    I HATED Latuda  I know for a lot of people it's their miracle drug  but I was sleeping 14  hours a day on only 20mg  I did feel a bit better  but  hypo mania and depression kept on seeping through  so my pdoc had me quit   thank god   Now I'm on Tegretol for mania and Lamictal for depression  They're both very mild drugs  which is why I'm trying these before the ones with more severe side effects  like lithium and depakote   I'm still on very low doses of both  going to up them after my appt tomorrow   but they seem to be working  I have energy changes  in that some days I talk a lot of don't sleep as much  and others I do the exact opposite  but those changes come without the corresponding mood swings  if that makes sense  As in  I'm not actually sad when I'm in a "depressed" phase  just tired  So I think that's a good sign  and hopefully higher doses will help even more  I also haven't had any side effects yet  which I'm really pleased about 
Whoever you are  I believe in you  You can make it through this because you're awesome   
I know your pain  My husband has been trying to find me one because I would never get around to doing it  I hate talking on the phone  surprise surprise   But I've had a hard time finding someone whose hours work for me and that I also feel comfortable with  On a positive note  I have had two counsellors in the past that I absolutely LOVED  One when I was younger and living with my parents  and another one my husband and I went to last year when we lived in a different city  
i feel lonely thing is i have friends  its a weird feeling  
Think about the freedom it'll give you  No more asking for rides  taking the bus  Just the whole independence a DL can give you  Well worth the panic it can cause  Even if you don't have a car  a DL is the stepping stone  That's another thing I personally do   weigh out the cons and pros of situations  Even if you fail   you tried and failed  Not trying is the worst thing because  you won't know what could've happened  Doesn't only apply for a DL but life in general  If you know how to drive and studied   a DL test will be a small but huge victory 
I believe in you  You can pull through this  Take as much time as you need for recovery     You're amazing 
An endless neverending fucked up cycle of despair
Im actually on Latuda currently and it is causing me some problems 
Thanks  I hope I can  
Im a fixer too  I like to problem solve and like to be in control a lot of the times  I feel quite vulnerable when Im not  But the fact of the matter is  you and I cant solve all the problems  we can only solve our own that affect us  if its someone else who has the problem  then its up to them  we cant do anything  it sucks  but its life  And if we were all the same then itd be boring   What you can fix is the things that are bothering you  the problems that arise in your relationships  your anxiety  the feeling that youre not good enough for someone  Ive felt like that but the only way to get over it is by improving yourself  working on yourself OR just fake it until you make it  Every morning when you get up say a little mantra to yourself  a long the lines of Im a confident  funny  sexy guy  or something  Just fake it until you make it   For example  Ive felt like Im not good enough and I realise what I need to do to feel myself again and to love myself is get back in shape  Lose the weight so that I see myself as being attractive to others  that I love myself and then everything else will fall into place because it just radiates off you  So for me  if I get in shape Ill have a better chance of meeting a girl and being in a relationship with someone Im attracted to  Ill feel more confident meeting new people  for example  when I go for an interview  Im wanting to switch careers this year  and my overall health and mood will be good you know  All from losing weight and being healthy   Mornings are rough for me too  I wake up with no plans for the day   Im currently off work for holiday  I work in the restaurant industry  We take holidays when we can get them  So Im kicking it at home  with no real plans  no one to see  it sucks  But  I say ok  so I need to go to the gym  I need to be super healthy on my diet today  I need to look for a new job  I need to sort this out at my bank  I need to do this to my car  I need to sell this or I need to read this book  Or even  I want to talk to this friend today  see this family member today  Its all about having little productive things or stuff to look forward to   Youre not alone man  So dont worry ok  Were all in the same boat  at least Im in the boat with you where are we sailing to     
Have you ever heard of relationship ocd   Reddit has a subreddit called ROCD     it kind of sounds like what you might be going through
I have some friends and a brother  I feel that relationships tend to always complicate things and create more problems than they solve 
Lurker but made an account just to say I relate to this so much  You aren't alone and your obsessive thoughts are NOT you    I suffer from similar OCD almost exactly like you  that's the nature of this illness  When these thoughts come  as hard it is to get out of your head  try to tell yourself that "my OCD is making me feel or think   "  not "you"  It helps separate yourself from the OCD  Also try to focus on something else  I try to tell myself "id like to move on to something else now   "   Really tho I know I'm not what I think too and know I'm not some sick person  neither are you  The intrusive thoughts can be horrible sometimes  and certain people can really trigger it after those thoughts manifest    but remember that you aren't your thoughts and you know deep down you know yourself  I hope I explained this okay I am in the same boat as you with all this  so just giving you some advice I learned from friends and therapy  Stay strong and remember you don't need reassurance from anyone  I can completely relate to always wanting that tho haha story of my life  and separate yourself from the OCD the best you can  
Mainly  I want to build my confidence  I've been feeling pretty motivated for the last week  I'm going out for some drinks with co workers wednesday night  and I'm gunna try to approach people at the bar  and just have conversations with them  Maybe i'll get lucky  and actually meet someone i click with 
Because it's fun  and fun is what we all want  It's just that everyone's definition of fun isn't the same 
Thank you for letting me know    Glad to hear im not the only one having trouble with Latuda
Take a few steps back   Ask yourself why you feel like you've failed at such a young age  Many people get kicked out of school but can still manage in life with the right attitude  Your mum sounds like she is just trying to help you out  so at least thank her for that but in this instance it sounds like it didn't work and that's just part of trying   nothing wrong with it at all  Figure out what it is in life that you enjoy doing and spending time on and shape it into a hobby and perhaps a job or career  For example if you like movies  look at working at a cinema  If you like sport  a sport store  My point is  once you fix your attitude to something and realise that you can indeed overcome your anxieties you'll be on your way to making good decisions and improvements   take it from someone who knows   All the best   
Thank you so much for your reply 
This  It's not a real thing  Just an ad hominem used by confused feminists 
If it'll give you peace of mind then see your doc about it   won't hurt to ask  The things that anxiety can manifest itself into is   to me   insane  I've been battling anxiety panic for years and even to this day I somehow exp new symptoms because  of it  But at the end of the day I am prone to anxiety and I always keep that in mind  Maybe write down what you're doing when it happens  maybe you can somehow figure out what exactly is triggering those sensations for you  
Don't feel bad about ranting  its a tough disease and people for the most part don't understand how you feel   You most likely have nothing  but if it turns out you did you would have it cured before you notice any symptoms  There are pills that quickly kill ringworm    Also keep in mind that two members of your family currently have this  are they freaking out like you  Probably not because they know its curable   Accept the fact that the fear of this will be with you until you can talk to a doctor about it  Fear is your enemy not the facts  The facts before you are not particularly concerning but your illness is making it worse   Distraction will only give you temporary relief    accept the fact that you have fear and breathe your fear in  Remain calm through fear   Then breathe out the fear  Try this for a half hour at least  just accepting your fear and accepting that it won't go away for a little while  Its also not going to kill you   Remind yourself that it takes a tough person to overcome OCD and don't feel shame for it   Cheers buddy 
If you're up for it  apologise to them but then also explain that you didn't know and that no one told you anything about it  You can't be expected to "just know" that's what is done  If you do that you acknowledge you did something that offended them  but you also stand up for yourself and that deserves respect  If they still don't like that  then they are the ones with the problem not you  
1  I'm going to therapy this year  I was given medication a few weeks ago but I haven't taken it yet   2  I aim to make some actual friends at work  Or at least be able to speak to them without freaking out and over analysing everything they say   3  I'm determined to stop punishing myself and re living embarrassing moments over and over again 
At first it can even make you feel worse  and at times increase anxiety  but after a while it will do what it's supposed to like calm you down  make you a little bit more relaxed  a little more focused and it helps you sleep at night  But it has it's downsides  you might feel tired  restless and sometimes even more unmotivated  lazy  etc     all of these aren't even that "big"   just slight changes  I've been using it for more than 2 years now  50 mg  Even though i believe it doesn't work anymore i'm scared of putting it away because not taking it makes me feel dizzy and nauseous   I experiment a lot with different pills  drugs    i know it's fucked up but it's my pursuit of happiness  feel free to ask more questions  
Agreed  
Yeah I'm asking that   could the fact that you hate yourself just a way to defend yourself against accusations of laziness 
That doesn't sound like something a stupid guy would do  More like a very good guy    
Nothing is fun to me    I don't see anything as fun
Sounds like you're fixated on the issue and so over thinking it   I think you know this  though  so you're headed the right direction   
New year or not it's always the same shit  
It depends on what you were doing and the guy  Some are oblivious 
me too
What will you all play  Right now the 4 man meta appears to be Barb  Monk  WD x2 or Barb  Monk x2  WD  I'll probably breakout my monk if we want to bring a good four man  I don't play Barb or WD though  
Yes    Almost if not all mood stabilizers can cause drowsy groggy zombie effects
what about lamictal   agmantine instead  
Way to be    I really want to do something similar but for 12 months in china  Vietnam or Cambodia  The anxiety thing is a challenge  but I'm hoping I can overcome it 
 Very relevant comic  http   www depressioncomix com posts 191  
Just remember that you're not alone in the world and you can do it 
I've definitely been in your shoes  and have now reached a point in my life where I have great friends whom I love  so there's hope  One thing to remember is that many people  even those who are very outgoing  go through periods where they feel alone and like meeting people is difficult  Try to remember that this is just your situation right now  and it doesn't define who you are or who you'll always be 
I got better  I learned how to function  That's what helped me the most  I can help myself when I have dips in the road because I know what it looks like  You have to be willing to put in the work  If you're young  that can also do it  I'm 25 now  super depressed currently  but I know how to get better  I'm currently waiting on my medications to help me  I had to get off cymbalta since it stopped working and will hopefully take emsam again soon  I've been really down  but I can take care of myself now and know how to get the help I need  
I have OCD too   was in law school and I had a final exam  which I wasn't prepared for  took 20 pages of notes and once I got there I realized I was only allowed one page of notes  So I had to pick which one of the 20 pages was most important to me and throw away the rest   Got a B  still   Your anxiety is your only enemy  you will miss some questions but the only people who fail exams for the most part are the people who really don't care  You're clearly not one of those people   Just take one question at a time and you will be good I'm sure of it
How are you on your own  Do you like spending time by yourself  
Is it better to take it in the evening  
I agree  La Croix is a good substitute  Still fizzy and has some flavor

Thanks means a lot  
I'd like to emphasize the importance of contacting your insurance to ensure that they will cover visits with whichever specific provider you choose  There is always a small possibility that online info is out of date or wrong and if you talk to an insurance rep  make sure to take down their name  and they tell you that they participate with the provider you choose  then you shouldn't be liable for more than just your copay  I guess it's not incredibly likely that psychologytoday's insurance information is wrong  but contacting your insurance directly is always the most secure way to go    
Just do something for yourself then  Eat something you like  watch a movie or something  Make the date be just an excuse for you to do something nice 
Yeah it can be a weird weird thing lol  thanks for the advice
Ugh I'm sorry  that really sucks 
Honestly i don't think this is the kind of guy you want to associate with anyway  Best thing you can do in the new year is try to move on
If you ever need someone to vent to  you can PM me  Good luck with everything   
Honestly I think the only thing that helps is talking to people about it that understand your plight   I have the exact same thing   Perfectly fine all day  doing things   As soon as the sun drops  I get caught in negative thought loops about my life death and have a existential dread   I have been this way about two years now  but   It does get better   Now I can go days weeks without having a bout of fear   I hate it  but doing something that requires focus like competitive gaming helps me ignore the fear until I'm tired enough to fall asleep   Sorry if I can't give any help  but just talking about it will usually help     Just know that you aren't alone   Most people are just too stupid to realize they're going to die   They live in a haze just wondering around   Enjoying things   Lol   Go see a therapist   Try CBT   It might help   It helped me with the physical symptoms of anxiety starting into a panic attack 
The short answer is Yes  The long answer is that although yes  it does make it worse  it's not something that you need to beat yourself up for every time you get the urge  You are going to seek reassurance and its ok that you have failed in the past  You are going to fail again in the future   I have tried medication and consistent exercise  exercise is better for my anxiety IMO but also meditation is very important to prevent reassurance seeking as well as anxiety  I strongly suggest you watch this link below as meditation is not a new age idea that you have to be buddha to perform  It is just a focus on being in the moment which can prevent pain in all of us   https   www youtube com watch v fXmG1x1ih1U  best of luck to you   remember to strive for constant improvement and forgive yourself when you fall short 
Because you're here    life doesn't exist for a purpose  but instead because it can    However  make no mistake that you are unique  The atoms in your body  the memories in your brain  there has never been anything built just like you  and there never will be  It's not that you don't have skills  it's that you haven't found yours yet  or developed them    nobody starts off knowing themselves  nobody starts off good at anything  Nobody 
Pretty sure that's exclusive to physically disabled people and is difficult to do regardless  Don't kill yourself dude
I bought a set of adjustable weights for like  50  I can close the curtain and no one can see me    also I can play my own music    yahhhhhhh gyms give me panic attacks too
i was hurt the same way so many times by my "friends" i learned to live without them  Probably not best advice ever    I just have good colleagues in work but no high hopes for any closeness  If i change job tomorrow  i will stop talking to them and not even cry about it  Even better to forget  I wish they will forget the little piece of    misery I am   
Thanks for the feedback 
Hello   I just finished posting also with some of the same symptoms  I completely understand the fear of heart problems  I have no solution  or advice really  But I saw this post 5 seconds after I posted mine    You're not alone  
I know exactly how you feel  My best friend cut me off because of things that happened when we were in high school  She was never the most stable but    it still hurts  Missing them like you miss the sun on your face  All the problems  everything would be acceptable just to be able to know that they want you again   I know how you feel    But it gets better    or it can  It takes time  It hurts  But it can    Would you like to talk  If so I'd very much like someone to talk to too    pm or reply 
ok 
thank you for answering   Everything is going out of control  And my life is the only thing I'm still able to have in my hand  Getting out is gonna be my best bet to fix everything 
You could try counting to four billion and see how hard that is  Or you could compare how far we have come in 10 000 years of civilisation and imagine how long ago we'd likely have left the planet in four billion years time  We've effectively only used up 0 00025  of our civilisation time so far  and we can already drive remote vehicles around on Mars  and have identified hundreds of other potentially habitable planets 
Of course  And seriously  don't hesitate to ask any questions 
Nonsense  Who says you're repulsive  And more then that  there are many who wouldn't care   
Just curious  why can't you move to Nebraska 
I saw you post on another anxiety thread too  Are you a therapist  Or someone who has overcome SA  Just curious     Thank you for the great tip  
I'm really sorry but I don't have a solution  but I can relate  I like to describe it as the angel and devil on the shoulders senario  The Angel is your rational  calm voice and the devil the panicking  irrational idiot that always seems to manage to drown out the angel  I have pretty much all day  every day  A constant civil war in my head  But it's mainly in concern with my heart flutters and skipped beats  Desperately trying to convince myself that it's just an anxiety flare up  I'm not going into heart failure  It's physically  emotionally and mentally exhausting   The only way I manage to keep it from becoming another terrified trip to ER  is to repeat what the doctor said the last time I was there 'you have lovely  strong rhythm from all four heart valves  and your bloods and ECGs are beautifully normal'  Doesn't stop the palpitations but it stops me from going 180 into pure panic  It's horrible though cos I have my two young children in bed right now  and that little devils voice keeps whispering 'yes but what if they doctors missed something and you die in your sleep  and the kids find you in the morning'   I'm sorry you're going through this  I wouldn't wish it on anyone xx
is that drug the general anesthesia they give before the procedure  was it only short term memory  how many treatments did u have and for how long  was there short term improvement and then it faded with lack of treatments  I know a lot of questions but the more you could tell me the better  I'd really appreciate it 
Dropping out isn't the same as fixing anything  You're right that you have a choice here  Choose to live
What kind of light thearpy 
What kind of light thearpy  Do you have a wave length 
It's possible but generally a lot more difficult than with effective meds  People can have a good few years before symptoms return  If you choose not to use meds then I think the most important thing is to really jump on it and do something at the beginning of a depressive  but particularly a manic episode  
Horror movie setting    I relate to that     Panic attacks  anything related to trauma    It is something very serious  and should not be dismissed  or be made fun of  or anything like that   
 hit the gym  or go out and meet someone else   you can make it all disappear tonight if you wanted  all you have to do is trust yourself and speak to a new person  
 New Years is always my worst day   Man  so fucking true  For many others  it's NYE   but for me  the first day of the New Year  the first of many days that just will not be good is absolutely terrifying    
hugsssss   "     "     "   yah i get that
Nah  there is nothing that can be done but yeah it sucks  I hope you manage  since I really can't help you   
Well that sounds    weird  Yeah that definitely sounds pretty abnormal  I'd have a chat to your group if you haven't yet about him  see what everyone else makes of it  and also does he have any like proper anger management issues or something  
Thanks for taking the time to reply  I'm just sat up in bed right now trying to ignore the heart flutters  watching ghost hunters and doing some crochet  I feel like I'm silently fighting with this  so I don't end up falling apart again and taking myself back to the hospital  I hope you're ok and also finding some solace from my post xx
yeah a little  im better at identifying it and going "oh I should calm myself down before it happens" now than I was before
I should also specify  it's usually NYE New Years  As in  around midnight  That's when my anxiety attacks start to lose their shit 
I don't know dude 
I responded surprisingly well to Anafranil  I did terrible on Luvox  which was also supposed to be the best     There are plenty of things to try  Some swear on Zoloft  Others loved Paxil  You have options  Maybe a med to augment yoyr current one  
 I don't like eating anymore    and eating is expensive  I don't need an excuse to do anything  it would be meaningless of I fabricated some reason to do something "enjoyable celebratory"     I don't need fun in my life
I just read through a couple dozen of these and I can completely relate to 95  of these  Some I feel I could have written myself  i e  They used the exact same words going around in my head  
Hi carriebooper   You don't mention how old you are now  but I'm a little concerned at how much detail you included here   This is as safe a forum as we can make it  but it is public and we cannot stop others from reading through your experience with reasons other than to help and support you  I just want to make sure you understand that   That said  I am so very impressed with you for being able to write all this out   Some people go many years without being able to talk about what happened to them and this is a first step for you in healing   How are you feeling now having written it all out   I'm very sorry for what the guard did to you   I hope you know now that there was  nothing  legal or necessary about how he handled it   That was rape and abuse and  if you reported it  would carry a severe penalty for him   And anything you felt or experienced during what he did is very normal and nothing to feel ashamed of     This is not your responsibility  but if you are able to report him  you may be preventing him from doing this to many other little girls and saving them from what you are going through   I really recommend you think about going into some therapy with someone trained in sexual assault recovery   If you aren't sure about that  we can talk more about what that might be like   I'm glad you found us here and trusted this space with your very personal story   Please let us know how we can help you   Keep writing and ask any questions you have   All my best 
not at all  if i'm alone for even a couple hours i get really sad 
   thank you again  I hope you had a good new year  I'm feeling like there's nothing wrong again and I'm just lazy   how do you tell the difference  I know I'm repeating myself  I'm sorry  my head goes round in circles  I hate myself for being so lazy  but then I don't have the energy motivation to do anything    Like I can still function normally and laugh etc so surely there's nothing that wrong 
Yes  I was also very glad when I found those  Those are very helpful when explaining it to healthy people  The comics also deal with the effect depression has on partners or friends    I saved dozens of them because I identify that much with many of those 
I went to bed at 1015 pm and it felt wonderful to wake up at a normal hour  fully rested and no hangover  I'd take that over most other ways last night could have gone 
What about  this do you find funny 
I do my best everyday to touch as little  as possible when I leave my house  Lysol wipes are a godsend  
I was with my boyfriend's family and his friends for NYE  but it was super isolating because this past year has been really bad for me and my anxiety  especially when it comes to friendships  and just coming off from a very quiet birthday   Social obligations are so tough  and having social media doesn't help when so many people around you are seemingly loved so much more  I put way too much pressure on myself when it comes to interacting with others or making plans  It just upsets me and I don't feel any kind of happiness  even when during times when I'm actually seeing people 
It depends on the province you're in  As I suspect each province is different  In B C  I had to get on wage assistance first to make it easier for the Disability to be approved   I was also told by everyone I saw  and recommend this myself  go to an advocacy group first  They will create a case file  Fill out the paperwork with you and write a letter to your doctor instructing him how to properly fill it out and phrase it in such a way that it's more "acceptable" to the government  In B c  not only did I need a doctor but I needed a secondary person as well  I used my psych as my secondary person and my family doctor as my main  Once all parts are filled in you need to mail it to the government  Depending on backlog waiting on status could be a while  I submitted mine end of August 2015 and was approved end of December 2015    If you are not approved at first  you can appeal the decision  This is where having a file with the advocacy group comes in handy  because they will help you with the appeal process  Whereas if you're on your own   then you've got to figure it out yourself    In B C  the Disability status is permanent  So long as you keep your papers  If you leave B c  then return after 10 years  if you resubmit your acceptance paper your disability will be reinstated    Once again though  I highly recommend you check out your local disability alliance  They will hold your hand through everything  
I actually found some movies very helpful when at my lowest point a few months back     Two Days  One Night   is a very sad movie about depression but I think it's ultimately uplifting  It reminded me that there were reasons to go on  and that even if things don't work out the struggle is worth it      Happy Go Lucky   encouraged me to be more optimistic  not in a delusional or fantasy kind of way  but because rolling with the punches life gives you feels like the most productive way to live    They both helped me through rough times but everyone's mileage will very  
Video games and a lot of it 
You're definitely not alone  Latuda made me vomit almost every night   P   Edit  But lamictal probably saves my life every day  So good stuff is out there   P
I hope I get my shit together finally in 2017  else I don't know what I am gonna do  I wish for all of you to come out of this shit too  this mental torture 
Same here  I came on this site to hopefully find people who felt like I do in hopes that I wouldn't feel so alone  I'm always here to talk if you need someone 
This is the blessing and curse of the anxious  we are so vigilant we want to protect Earth for billions of years       I have had the same fear  I have two kids  and I'm sure one day they will have kids  etc  and I think  will there be some awful time where some of my descendants can't live on Earth  How awful  what if I were living that right now  We're hypersensitive and put ourselves into the future   But let me tell you something  the time scale on which that will occur is so large that humans in the year 5 000 000 000  assuming there ARE humans then  will be unrecognizable to us today  If humans have survived that long  they will have figured out things we literally can't even imagine today  That may give you hope  not fear   Think about what humans from the 1500s would think of us today  great terrors have come  but great successes have as well  You  by your ancestors' survival of countless disasters  plagues  wars  injustices  are a miracle  Those ancestors didn't give up    So those humans in the year 2057  or 2141  or 252525  will wonder about us in "prehistory"  here in 2017  and may thank you for being vigilant about them   It may help you to think about Earth's distant past  and be amazed at how far life has come on Earth  so long as it doesn't stress you out   Instead of looking forward  look back  as New Year's custom dictates    I used to study astrophysics  so I find the distant future of the universe fascinating  
Thanks  I'm feeling better now because in hindsight I do think I was justified  
 removed 
Heh      you lasted longer than I did   I went out by myself around 9   Stayed at the bar for 7 minutes until i started panicking  then went home and spent the rest of the night alone as i listened to fireworks and cheers outside my window   However stupid it was at least you said stuff 
Wish I could help you  but you're posting your question in the most wrong subreddit on here 
I usually "celebrate" by watching Syfy's Twilight Zone marathon  It's been an on and off tradition for many years now  Still felt like shit and went to bed early though 
I couldn't sleep at all last night thinking like that  I feel ya bro  
That's not at all a little thing   Congratulations  hugs  and Happy New Year   Thank you for sharing this   So many others here need to see that there are lights at the end of what sometimes feels like an endless tunnel   I'm very happy for you 
I saw the Shawshank Redemption some months ago  Almost had to cry at the ending  It's not a movie about depression but it's also about living without hope  living in restraints  being desperate    I can also recommend Road to Perdition  Also a very beautiful movie   And I don't know how helpful it actually is but watching Fight Club again also was one of my depression movies  The futility of ones life  loneliness  self destruction and sleeplessness among other things are just things I was able to relate to    First season Daredevil also was good   I recently made this list of  movies I can recommend  https   www reddit com r depression comments 5k4lpa anyone have any netflix suggestions that arent dblaw4t   
I'm trying to stick to recovery of an ED  along with bipolar depression  and freaking fibromyalgia  I'm going to my pdoc Tuesday morning  and telling him that shit has hit the fan  broken it  and the blades are flying into pieces 
Sometimes I am able to help myself  other times it feels overwhelming  but somehow I need to get there  Thank you for your words  I wish you luck and hope you can get what you need and where you need to be too
I take my Lamictal in the evening   my doctor advised me to do so to avoid any tiredness side effects     
Read this and have a few thoughts   1  You are not gay   2  You are also really bad at picking up social queues  Has this been something you have struggled with your whole life  If so it's something that you may want to think about   people with low confidence levels about certain things and or problems with social queues are more likely to be "used" than others  My guess is that the gay guy you are talking about thought your low confidence levels about women were a sign that you are unsure about your sexuality  this is not the case  Because you are not gay   3  HOCD is tough to deal with  it's one of the few types of OCD I have not personally experienced but I have heard others talk about it and you should not feel ashamed to have this problem in your life  It will go away  maybe not anytime very soon  but it will go away  You will need to work on it until it does   4  You are not "naive" or "passively submissive"  You have anxiety and it affects your decisions  You are also not objectively "nicer" than others even if you think you are and even if you are "nicer"  that's not really a good thing for you  You don't have to be an asshole or a misogynist to stop thinking about yourself this way  but as soon as you stop talking to yourself about how "nice" you are  you'll stop feeling "submissive" to others  You wouldn't be a homophobe in this situation to call this guy a sick fuck and tell him off  But you didn't do that and that's ok  because you learned from that and you won't do that again in the future   5  Homosexuality is not a light switch that you switch on and off  If you were gay you would be totally sure of it by now  Gay people know theyre gay by the time theyre 8  You're not gay even if you don't have a lot of experience with women   6  Watch this video   https   www youtube com watch v HZm4B4foybM t 2692s there are many things you can learn from this guy Leo  He's a life changer and his advice applies to everyone with any anxieties or insecurities or imperfections  The path to success in life  whether its relationships  or money  or strength  is the same   do what's difficult to do and continuously work toward self improvement  You don't want to be "used" by others you want to be empowered yourself  Nobody out there in the world will teach you that  they all have their own motivations and things they want from you  In the case of the fruitcake you were friends with  he wanted to see you naked   7  You're obviously attractive enough that a gay guy who looks good is attracted to you   this means that once you overcome your confidence issues  women will be more attracted to you as well  As you get older people will care less about how "social" you have been in the past   they care about how you see yourself  how you carry yourself  and how successful you believe you can be  You can be all of those things I can tell by reading what you have written  you may not see that now but in time and with dedication to self improvement you will   8  I'm not gay  I have a beautiful wife  I see other men all the time and have thoughts about the fact that they are attractive  So you have eyeballs  I also believe I am a nice person  But you know what  the world doesn't care  Once you find the girl that's right for you she will care that you are nice  but that's not going to help you at all on a first date   You're young and you have many successful days ahead of you   remember to focus on yourself and when you get negative thoughts  HOCD  POCD  ROCD  health anxiety  whatever comes your way  remember that you are not your worries and you will overcome them    
Hi     Come talk  i don't want you to go  
Same for me today  too   
I feel the same  I try to focus my mind on things like roleplaying and such  Still it's very hard  but humans are superb on surviving 
If you have had a bad cold that can cause diarrhea  Post nasal drip  Mix that with cranberry juice and IBS and it's a recipe for disaster    Let me tell you  the week between Christmas and New Years has been hell on my guts  Stomach bug isn't likely since we have only left the house once and that was 4 days ago  But man oh man  Cookies and chocolate and spinach dip  Sometimes the holidays just make you feel like garbage  
Welcome   My mother had borderline  and it helped me a lot at having insight into my own condition  so yay for having a bit of a leg up due to experience in the field   I'm not sure about what comes first  but there's a couple of things you ideally could would do simultaneously  the times stated are for me  I'm BP1 and no one is an average case  YMMV      Accept what you have  and that it's for life  This took quite a while for me  I think about 2 years  It's not the same as  accepting I'm depressed right now but I'm going to get better and I will never  have to worry about it  It's a case of  I need to make some lifestyle choices that other people don't have to make  and I have to carefully monitor my moods and major life decisions  For life  Therapy helps a lot with this    Sort out your meds  That's both filling off the extreme edges of mood swings  crippling depression and mania   but also cutting down if you start becoming too flat too dumb  That process took me about 1 5 years  and I'm still tuning a bit    Start practicing self care and routines  This might sound stupid if you're not in a depression right now  but that means regular shower body hygiene  regular meals that are not entirely shit  some regular exercise  regular sleeping  regular regularity  Alcohol  caffeine  tobacco  in moderation  Some swear by abstinence  they might be right  And  above all   you probably know this   impeccable medication hygiene  Create a habit of taking your meds  always carry a days supply  etc    This paragraph was for me the really long and exhausting part  I'm never going to finish this  and I've already relapsed quite a bit from my good weeks    I barely involve any of my family or friends in my illness  But I have discovered a trick to getting people to see the severity of it  and give them space to ask questions  Drag them to your psychiatrist  Mine was open to the idea  and my siblings were a lot more receptive to a person with a degree nailed to the wall telling them I was seriously ill  then their little brother saying he was    I can imagine that having a loving and supporting fiance is a great help  You probably will have to learn to care for yourself  before you can teach others how to care for you  But I have also noticed my father  who I live with  is a good second opinion on my mood swings  and he has a better memory  so he's a good authority on how I've evolved over long periods   Sorry for the rambling  writing is how I order my broken mind    Good luck

I work with my depression  I've always been pretty functional  Do you take medications or see a therapist  I did have a while where I had crying spells at work and they adjusted my medications and it helped  
I have never ever had vomiting from an antibiotic  Maybe some intestinal issues but never throwing up  
Those are a lot of the things I've struggled with  so yeah I do get what you're feeling  Your university's doctors should be a big help  I know mine are
disclaimer  i don't know your situation or the people around you as well as you do  so if this seems like a bad idea  don't do it  also i don't generally advocate lying    I know how you feel  maybe you could try telling people you aren't actively suicidal  but you are passively suicidal  that may or may not be true  but if they don't think you'll actually try anything  you may not be institutionalized but you will still get help  it seems like a decent way to let people know how you're actually feeling without worrying them to the point of sending you off somewhere   however  if there is someone who knows you better and whom you trust more than the person you told last time  tell them the truth  you've probably heard this a thousand times  but they legit care about you and want the best for you  
Thanks  it has been 1 year and 7 months  so it has taken awhile to get here  If sharing helps anyone even a little then I'm glad I did  
Sadly you're a couple of hours away so i can't give you a hug we can talk if you like
Hi chickfactoring   It's really difficult to say to one person who's been through what you have what is "normal "  I often tell my clients that normal is exactly what you are going through because that is what's normal for you   We move into and out of feeling the impact of what happened to us over time   Sometimes it's so intense we can't bear it  sometimes it feels like nothing at all   I hesitate to say that what you are experiencing is a form of dissociation  which is when we are so disconnected from feeling that we think of what happened as though it was another person or we feel disconnected from ourselves now   It's possible that if you've spent time thinking about and writing about what happened to you  that you have gained some emotional distance from it   That's the ultimate goal of therapy  not to have the events disappear from your mind  but to be able to see them as a bad thing that happened that no longer affects your life today   So  yes  it's very normal   I suppose the question then becomes what  kind  of normal is it for were you are now   I hope this wasn't a confusing answer   It's sometimes so hard to make sense of our feelings as we move through the trauma   I can say this  you have nothing to feel guilty about  but it's also okay that you feel that way   All my best 
That feeling of high alert is called hyperawareness  You are using the term "triggered" properly   Given how distressed you feel about what is happening  I encourage you to speak with your parents  if they are understanding about your diagnosis  about getting professional help  If that's not an option  take a look at a book called Healing Trauma  There's some good trauma reading if you do a little searching on Google   Edit  added missing word
Also if anyone doesn't know  green tea is naturally has caffeine in it  I think it actually has more than regular coffee  
I know where you're coming from with the worthless humanities degree  I'm a Psychology major   which can lead to great things if you want to spend three more years in Grad school  Like you though  I despise school  Always have  Sucks  doesn't it  If anything  it makes you want to end up with a job you enjoy because you know what it's like to dread what you have to do day in and day out  I'm sure you've explored your avenues  but I just feel the need to throw this in there  I love the medical field  but have no interest in a medical degree  I realized a lot of Psyc classes apply to Occupational Therapy  so I plan to go on to become and OT  I'm sure you've looked at similar things with your degree  but that's just a thought  I've struggled with anxiety for a long time now  and I think depression is starting to become an issue as well  It's such a shame  shame is an understatement  that so many college students struggle with mental health as an effect of school  Anyway  I do hope you can find something meaningful and enjoyable to do with your life  And everyone can find someone to spend their lives with  even in the most unexpected ways  Good luck to you 
Big step  Way to go  Glad your parents are behind you  Good luck at the doctor's 
Hey  just thought you should know that I did the same on my Facebook about 15 mins ago  Already got a fair few likes     Haha  Feels good to have finally done it  Thanks for the advice and Happy New Year  
Recently someone send me a text about how to deal social anxiety that actually  could  help me    But I'm too afraid to hope  I don't have any will to get better anymore  There is a small part in me that wants help and a bigger part that just doesn't care anymore and a large part that just hates this body and this existence and wants to harm and punish it  I keep self sabotaging myself    I can't mentally grasp that I wasted my life  No matter if it was the illness or myself  I can't forgive myself  I can't accept my past  I don't have anything to look forward in the future  There are so many things that erode my selfworth that aren't related to my SA and that won't go away   I can relate to many of your points 
Omg man can I ask you something   I wanted to make a post on this sub about it  but I don't think many would relate    You enjoy the humor or stuff like  r 2meirl4meirl  right  That dolphin pic sounds like I saw it there    So my question is   do you find  r wholesomememes irritating at all  I feel db but it makes me angry  and I still can't fully believe people are being sincere there  but then again they can't believe "our" humor either  Anyhoo wondering what you thoufht
Awesome  I struggle with taking care of myself too  I don't know why it's so hard to want to shower and brush my teeth  I'm also type 2 diabetic and I struggle to check my bs and inject myself  My numbers are high a lot bc of this  I want to love myself enough to take care of myself  especially since I really want children  If I can't take care of myself  how can I care for another human being  It's hard  Good job on reaching your goal 
Sounds like you may be physically dependent which is slightly different to addicted  It's still something you want to get help for  
Honestly  I don't have many great suggestions for you because I'm struggling with the same things right now  Sometimes I feel great  and most of those times are when I'm with my boyfriend  When I'm not  depression can pop up very readily  One thing that does help me is spending time with my pets  I have a dog and two kittens   even though they can't really help you or talk about what's going on  it does help to have something there to love on  I've only had one severe panic attack  but I laid on the floor with my dog near the end of it and it was far better than sitting there alone  I know this wasn't a lot of help  but just know you aren't the only one  If you find it continues  maybe try talking to someone  I tried and it's not my thing  but I'm planning to meet with a different psychologist and see if we "click" better  I know that seems drastic  but it's always an option  I hope you can start building more and more positivity in your life  good luck to you 
Aw man that's fucked  I'm so sorry    like  actually  My heart hurt reading that  and that's rare  The image of crying to fireworks    Man that's like a brilliantly morose movie scene or something     I cried watching new year's concerts online  So much cheer and everyone hopes   
this will sound unbelievable it would to me if i was still depressed  but it does get better  its unfortunate that new years eve wasnt so great for you  i wish you to have a better day tomorrow even if you may still feel very depressed about everything but hopefully it will be better in some way or form       and i hope your health problems will get resolved soon  as ive had my fair share of them  they can be very stressful to deal with 
Good to know  thanks so much  
Ooh  holy shit  that's what I'm thinking and imagining too  I imagine that I am that person standing on some kind of metaphorical edge border and using binoculars to look into the area of happenings  It's like I'm only an observer that never stops observing everything possible  but be never part of the others  the happenings 
Lol 12 15 I logged in here  P
How old are you    
Wow that's a very helpful sheet  thank you  I've studied the DSM V but never seen the criteria broken down like that  Thanks again 
Sameeeee  similar to u firefades I'm not quite there geographically  I'm down in ol Landan town  so can't oblige in person    Sending a massive one virtually though  hope you're okay   
Yeah it's decaff not uncaff  There's a process to remove caffeine but they can't take it all out  
That's good to know  thanks  I'm not a fan of opening up and talking to people  but hearing that it's helped makes it seem a little better  Hope you're feeling well  
Thank you for the sentiment  It's not much but it does help 
Definitely a possibility  Mood stabilizers frequently cause that  On lamictal I was often groggy and tired  but on lithium it was like I could not ever keep my eyes open  Taking it at night helps  but it becomes super important to always get a full night of sleep either way 
If it's a burden to play then you can always put it down for later
Of course you deserve to be happy  You may not see it right now  but you're an amazing person  seriously  It wouldn't be better if you died  I know there's people out there who care about you  I believe in you  you can get through this rough spot  You're great   
I am so happy for you you are on the path to find your happiness 
"comparison is the thief of joy" I have heard of somewhere on reddit   
Echoing everything  u tigalicious and  u TongaGirl wrote     You have every right to feel violated   I'm sorry your girlfriend isn't taking this seriously  and she should know that her not supporting you can affect your relationship   I typically recommend this guide to men who are struggling on how to support a woman they care about who was abused  but it may have some helpful information for her to better understand what you are going through   http   www capefearpsych org documents Rape mensguide pdf  For you  I would strongly recommend checking out the  r mengetrapedtoo which is a forum just like this one  specifically for men   All my best 
I know what you mean  I feel like saying you like to watch movies may sound more socially acceptable  eye roll  to people  Would that work 
Agmatine doesn't have much human research for psychiatric purposes  Since it inhibits NMDA receptors without inhibiting AMPA receptors it would probably be synergistic  but it's hard to say 
please feel free to pm me if you need to vent 
Do you have the resources to talk to someone  Some people hate the idea  including myself  I did it  but things have gotten worse again so I'm going to make myself revisit that option   Even if it isn't your favorite  it may help to get that initial "boost" out of feeling like you're in a hole  Situations like this  and I certainly don't know the extent of yours  are so difficult because there aren't a lot of options  Seeing a professional is certainly one  Medication does help some people  you just have to know that it's a route you're ready to take  One of my biggest fallbacks is my dog  Having a pet is huge for some people  so if you're able to go love on a dog  cat  hamster  whatever  I recommend it

Hi  I'm about two months in myself  I take it for anxiety  though I do suffer from depression as well  Man  it took a good week or two to feel better  I was super anxious  had flu like symptoms  it was rough  My doctor prescribed me Xanax to help with the transition    After the side effects wore off  my anxiety definitely has decreased  but not as much as it was with my previous medicine  I think Zoloft actually increased my depression  It made me have suicidal thoughts    I'm talking to my Dr about it later this week  I hope it gets better for you   Happy New Year 
Hi throwaway   You are being a really good friend during a very difficult time for her  so thank you for being there for her     As others here have written  what you  can  do is present her with options and be open to talking about them with her   What you  can't  do is make a decision for her  unless she is at some immediate risk of harm or injury   If you keep your focus on her being safe and supporting the decisions she makes  you will be on the right track   RAINN org is an excellent resource if she just needs to talk   She could also post here and receive ideas and feedback from us in a safe  supportive way   Something I'm going to recommend for you is this guide  http   www capefearpsych org documents Rape mensguide pdf  It's written for men to help them support a loved one or friend through rape   It's not long and will give you some direction on how to best support her   I also recommend you post to  r secondary survivors   It's a forum  similar to this one  but especially for loved ones of a rape victim versus the victim themselves   All my best 
Dude keep going and go to the doctor to make sure you don't have spinal problem 
I was the top student for all of my life high school college  Getting good grades will not make you happy forever there are so many things in the world that do not need good grades In my book  just try to find your own talent and dont make your self confidence miserable your self confidence needs your help  
I can relate dude  I threw a project X party on New Years Eve 3 years ago and my friend took all the credit  Join a club of your interest  What are your passions or hobbies
I'm so fucking lonely and depressed  the only reason I'm alive is my mom and dad  I love them too much to cause them the trauma of their kid dying  But I'm so lonely that it literally hurts me physically   My stomach hurts  my chest hurts  my head hurts   Everything  hurts  
I would strongly support this decision as well   A lot of what you need to deal with is your emotional response to all of this   We can give you some guidance and feedback about how to handle some of these feelings and ideas about what to do  but the more in depth work really needs to happen with a psychotherapist trained in trauma sexual assault   
Okay thank you  I'm going to start taking it at night now  I'm surprised my doctor didn't warn me  
Every time I get close to a point where I think I'm happy it's taken away  Like some kind of sick cosmic joke
Yes thanks for bringing that up  I caught a lot of flack over there actually because of how much my behavior spiraled out of controll  I was addicted to the dopamine reward of looking at nsfw subs  and even snapchatted 2 girls knowing they'd send me inappropriate photos  It was never about the people  just the thrill  I came clean of course and it entered into us breaking up  but she knows I wasn't being myself at all  and has forgiven me for that behavior as I work towards being my best self  Since the break up though I have been dealing with intrusive thoughts and obsessive rumination  so definitely characteristics of OCD type thinking  At ROCD though only one person replied and called me a shitty person 
Thanks
This is super common with anxiety  It is difficult to challenge yourself when you are already assuming the worst outcome  Two methods have always worked for me   1  Complete small tasks everyday  For starters make your bed  eat breakfast  tidy up  Write these down on a piece of paper  Cross them off as you complete them  Then continue on your day  After awhile these tasks will raise your self confidence and energy  at least it has always helped me   I always try to do atomething different once a week  I went to a hockey game that I was invited to 2 hours before hand  That was terrifying  but I did it  I went and broke it up  I created little tasks like get to the car  drive to stadium  meet friends  watch game  drive home  relax    2  Exposure therapy really worked for me  I'm currently an international student and customs and visa process stuff always made me anxious  I broke that by going to the immigration office to apply for student permit instead of online so I can experience it and go against it  It's not the best way cuz as you said  it can go either way  When it comes to social aspects  I recommend going out to dinner with a friend  Talk to the waiter or waitress  they WANT to talk to you to try and get a better tip  They are perfect options for working on talking to others and meeting new people  If you get overwhelmed  just walk away and go to the washroom and take a breathe and try again    It is a process and that is the worst part as time never seems to be on your side  I can tell you that over time  it gets better  When I look back 5 or 10 years  my anxiety was much worse  It's much better now  I'm on my phone so I can't get too much details  Feel free to pm me if you have questions or anything  Always glad to help  Also sorry if grammar is bad  phone   
I relate to this so hard  Sadness for me is a positive state  Am always grateful for movies that make me cry  it feels like someone broke open my soul and unclogged my emotions  In my case sad songs aren't as effective as sad movies  or some documentary about orphaned babies  I suggest you keep on watching tearjerker movies and may be with time crying will come easily to you  And btw isn't Rick and Morty supposed to be funny   Edit  Have you watched Adrien Brody's movie Detachment  think it might resonate a lot with you  
Medications are different for everyone  I personally have taken a number of medications  Zoloft  Prozac  Effexor  Luvox  even Klonopin at one point which I would highly not recommend over the long run   None have worked as well as consistent exercise  meditation  and refraining from abusing substances such as Marijuana and Alcohol   But no  not everyone responds well to Anafranil  and even if you did respond well to it there is no magic pill to cure OCD   the only cure is healthy habits  mindfulness patience  and acceptance  For some  medication can help  even help greatly  but I have yet to see someone with OCD who has been cured by medication and medication alone   I found during the times when I took medication that I expected to have the medication do the work for me  and as a result did not do the tough mental work of confronting my illness head on  I am not suggesting that this is true for everyone or even most people  but I think there is a temptation for anyone with a mental illness to think that one medication is the right one for them and will solve their problems   I recommend meditating for 20 minutes per day  even if you don't see the value in it for a long time  I am six months in and the first three months felt like a total waste of time  but I am glad I continued  Here is a very helpful link that has changed my life   https   www youtube com watch v fXmG1x1ih1U t 7s
This is so true  Incredible  seeing this exact description of where I'm at at the moment  gave me some feeling of confidence  I guess  Wow 
Thanks appreciate it and will probably will need to at somepoint same goes to you if you ever need to aswell   
I have the same thing  a nice souvenir from an abusive relationship   Since coming out of the relationship its actually gotten worse  I also feel your pain of people not understanding  I stopped dating a guy after he raised his voice at me because I couldnt see him in the same way anymore  He wasnt angry at me  he was angry at someone else and venting at me  so he didnt understand why I left  But I just cant take being shouted at  Its so bad now that I start getting shaky when anyone is annoyed at me  Im hoping itll get better as I move on and learn that abusive relationships are not the norm 
Yep I'm definitely hitting the gym and going out and meeting people and it helps  But my unconscious mind is still messed up about the previous girl   Example  I was having sex with a random hookup and couldn't get hard because of the anxiety  not performance anxiety but my general breakup anxiety 
Not wrong  but not right either  He is having struggles with talking to people which is a symptom of SA  He means that his SA is stopping him from talking to the girl and wants to know how not to freeze like he does   No need to be rude 
Ouch  biology is tough but she should be able to find a job with a masters in the biotechnology  This is a growing and demanding field   Just be with her  that helps alot and try these sub    r depressionregimens  r getting over it  r mentalhealth    BTW depression is not a sub if your looking for help  Only an extreme small amount do try and the majority of here is just for venting and unfortunately the comments are shallow  And on top of that a lot of the post in my opinion are kids 
For me it took a few months to show any improvement  For me  it didn't work as well as I liked so I switched to pristiq and I really like it  I can really tell if I don't take it  They say to wait at least 3 6 months before calling it quits on a medication because some of them take a little longer to build up in your system to a useable level  Hang in there for another month and see how you feel  you never know  it could start having an affect in the next week or so  Best of wishes  
I think first step is to go docters and then go from there  Also change my lifestyle and do more postive things is where I will start  I want a dog but where I live in a rented house we are not allowed one I don't know if I'll be able to keep with the responsibility just yet anyway I just want to concentrate on getting better 
Maybe you and she should see a therapist or a counselor  If the anxiety isn't affecting other areas of her life  she doesn't need medication  which makes things simpler  
Change yourself  just to be better   I am human and so are you  We are supposed to have flaws issues  We need to upgrade ourselves  Never ever be an outdated app 
We all go through rough spots in life and for some people it just takes longer to get out of it  I'm really proud of you for continuing to try to be happy again  I know it's super hard to  You're worth it and later in life you won't regret trying to pull yourself out of this  You're great   
It's true  Also  for those who don't know  mild roast coffee has more caffeine than dark roast   Pure caffeine   mild roast   medium roast   dark roast   decaf
I feel like mines the opposite and no matter how much water I drink my mouth is still dry  
Right on  good to know there are more people going through the same types of thought process  It's funny you should bring up vulnerability though  because lack of willingness to show that and shame for my actions were causing my anxiety to go out of control  You've probably seen it  but this is an amazing TED talk on it  https   www youtube com watch v iCvmsMzlF7o  Damn thank you so much for the words of encouragement  I've heard that a couple times but it's so hard to put into practice  How do you motivate yourself when you feel like your not libing a life for many good reasons  I'm in a city where I have only one good friend  and my work is great but a little reptetive at times lately  You're right though  Just being the person I know I can be though I think will bring me so much happiness  The idea of loving yourself is so so important too  so you hit the nail on the head there  Not only will working out make you more confident though  but it's also a great endorphin boost   I'm glad to hear that setting small goals for yourself each day is working out well for you  That's something that's going to be absolutely essential for me to do in order to not feel completely alone in my city  Onwards an upwards I suppose   Ha I'm so happy to hear that you're in this boat  I'm less likely to feel like sinking it knowing that you'd go down with me    I will say that I laid it all on the line today with her via email  Told her that I have to work on myself  but would love to think we can have a future together still  I know how much I have to focus on myself first  but over the past 4 weeks i've been able to really come into a sense of clearness about my behavior patterns  just wanted her to know how dedicated I am I guess  Definitely made me feel extremely vulnerable though 
Well done  and don't forget about your gums too  Give them a healthy light 'brushing' as well    Good job  
Just out of interest  as you sound like an expert journaller and I'm only really just starting out   what would you say are the best things to talk about in a journal  Questions to ask yourself etc  Do you journal when you're feeling bad  or reflect on it afterwards   I've had mixed results journaling whilst anxious compared to afterwards  Usually my journalling is really productive while anxious  and all my thoughts are racing in my head  However  when I'm in an irritable anxious state my journalling is unproductive  I don't find journalling while ok productive as I can't recreate the feelings and thoughts I had previously to note them down 
Are you sure  What do you spend most of your time doing that you want to do  I personally find video games and using the internet fun  It's what keeps me going 
Epilepsy  of course   Modest positive benefits for substance abuse  treatment resistant schizophrenia  Alzheimer's  Parkinson's  borderline personality disorder    really with anything involving glutamatergic neurotoxicity or oxidative stress it might provide a small benefit   I like it for unipolar depression at 200 mg  but I've just started that dose so we'll see whether it still works in a couple months  100 mg did nothing noticeable  but also had no side effects  Neither dose helps with anxiety 
Sounds like classic symptoms of anxiety   I would suggest a combination of medication  under the care of a psychiatrist that specializes in anxiety and not a regular dr   and CBT  cognitive based therapy    Managing anxiety is partially a skill you have to learn   It will never go away but you can learn how to deal effectively   You need to think of this like managing a long term disease like diabetes and not something you 'fix'     
Hey again   I was wondering about how long Trintellex or Effexor's bad effects lasted  I took Cymbalta more than 48 hours ago and I still feel pretty bad  At this point I'm trying to figure out whether it's a medication reaction or whether I'm just sick 
I think it's a good idea to see someone and go from there  Often times they have thoughts that you're able to consider in the furthering of your life change  Renting a house with a dog is definitely tough  I hope whoever you see is able to be a helpful influence  good luck 
Alot of people say after suicide attempts like the second they jumped or cut their artery or whatever they instantly regretted it and wanted to go back  those that survive say they're thankful they didn't die  I'm curious on how you view the attempt failing  As a good thing  
Hi again  would you mind if I asked how long your reaction to Prozac lasted  It's been more than 48 hours since I took Cymbalta and I'm still feeling sick  At this point I'm trying to figure out whether it's a medication reaction or whether I'm just sick 
Hey  good to see isn't it  actually being able put it into words  I've been in a dark place and one of old friend sent me that  I was in amazement when I read it  It does give you confidence stay strong friend 
I really wish i got the benefit of journaling that other people get  When I was seeing a therapist I spent as much time I could journaling  I filled up 3 80pg notebooks in as many months  and all my therapist had to say was something along the lines of     Sounds like you have a good handle on what your issues are  Keep up the good work   I didn't get anything profound out of it  nothing added by my therapist  So it seemed like a waste of paper 
I'm sorry about your situation OP  I'm not sure I can be of much help  I only ever respond negatively to sexual touch because I'm self conscious of how I look or if I can perform sexually  due to anxiety   I can see this being something I might have to deal with myself though in the future so I will wish you the best and keep an eye on this thread 
Recent college grad with nowhere to go  until next year   I have no friends so I "celebrated" new years alone in my bed  I have nothing to do and bored all day everyday    I can barely make it out of bed and when I realize I have nothing to do  nowhere to go  and no friends to talk to I go right back to my bed and contemplate why I'm here  I want to experience what the world has to offer but I either can get past my bed  social anxiety  or disassociating  On a good note  less thoughts about harming myself   So yeah  that's my check in for the week  
Agreeing with everything  u FreeOppression wrote     You are going through a traumatic re victimization of what happened to you  but now through the images of her assault  as you imagine it   This has caused your anxiety to come to the surface full force   The good news is that because you have already been through this  your recovery time should be much faster   You know how to get through this  you just need the professional support to do it   I realize you want to be there for her  but having one person in the world to rely on isn't the best prescription for healing   I would encourage you to encourage her to talk her therapist about what happened to her   My guess is that if her therapist knows something about trauma  they are probably already aware that there is something she isn't saying  that would make their treatment much more fruitful   As long as you are her only support  it's more difficult for her to move forward   Keep talking and writing   All my best 
I know that feeling  i kinda regret telling my doctor ive been feeling suicidal its just been a mess and made me feel like they cant do much  i am on prosac now which well see what that does  nothing so far  so i dont really know if its worth it  i know it should be
I felt like I don't deserve being happy    And that "happy me" was responsible for all this mess and so blind that he couldn't see it  Anything was preferable to that 
Sometimes it takes a long time to find meds that work for you   I've been on roughly 50 medications over the course of 15 years and it wasn't until last year that we found ones that really work for me   You just have to keep trying   So to answer your question  no  two particular meds not working for you does not mean you're out of luck   There are lots and lots of medications out there and they all affect people differently   
She sounds like an awful person troubled by a lot of issues  Don't let her being a fucking nut bag be the cause for you ending your life  Not everyone's parents love them  not everybody was intended  but I like to feel that everybody has a purpose  You might not be aware of what it is yet but shouldn't you allow yourself time to find it  
  I am more physically oriented  but totally   Mmm    In short  it's good because someone is on your side   
Yep  happens to me  too  I'm very aware of any sensation in my mouth or throat  I blame emetophobia

How much you love your kids has so much more to do with their quality of life than how much money you  or any parent  have   Your kids will be blessed with many things throughout their life and I'm sure you can teach them to notice   I'm not religious  but I like to think that "Solomon in all his glory"  part of a Bible verse comparing his clothing to the lilies of the field  I don't remember where it is  didn't know the comforts of the most basic modern household like indoor plumbing for toilets and hot showers and heat controlled by a thermostat   If children have modern comforts  and  the unconditional love of a good parent  they're doing better than 99 9  of humans that ever lived 
Do you take any anxiety medications by chance  
Sometimes when I'm low I like to think of scenarios like this  say for example you're walking out of a shop or whatever and you hold a door open for a lady  a lady who by all intents and purposes was going to go home and kill herself but you holding this door open restored just an ounce of hope in her  Next day she wins the lottery and starts up a charity organisation helping millions of people  as a direct result of your actions 
Hmm  Personal experience here  I had a nervous breakdown in my second year of college  At that point  all of my friends left me isolated me  No bueno  I dropped out of school and took about a year to learn how to be a real person again  Which is where I am now  back in college  College kids suck   Hardcore   My friends now are all 25 35 and that's been a huge benefit  I will hang out with my classmates to socialize and do homework together but I'm not going to put my emotional welfare in the hands of kids who don't know how to be kind and graceful  Disclaimer  I'm still learning too  I like older people  who realize that they don't have to justify their worth and existence to everyone around them  It's excellent   Of course  everyone is different and everyone's experience is different  But it seriously helped me  Keep your chin up   I was sure I was going to be alone for the rest of my life when a random conversation with a stranger led me to my entire new friend group 
Thanks for the response  I understand what you're saying but I don't feel as though this is just a period or a phase that I'm in  this is how almost my entire life has been so far  How did you change things in your own life 
I feel the same way  And people being angry at me makes me afraid of them

I actually get the opposite of this  When I find something new I get   REALLY REALLY   obsessed with it for a while  Like Ive ruined a relationship by moving too fast  I know EVERY song by a band within a week of discovering they exist I find that this fades over time  and Im not sure if its anything to do with anxiety  or if anyone else feels the same

Yikes  I'm sorry all this shit is happening in your life  OP  You may be going through a rough patch right now  but I know that you can get through this  I'm sure if you reached out to talk to your mother that you need her support  she would gladly help you out  It's awesome you found a new girl that you like though  I'm sure  even if you can't physically be with her  she can help you through a lot  I believe in you  You can do this  You're a great person 
It's totally normal to feel fine for years  But unfortunately when symptoms come back they can come on suddenly 
Yes
That's the worst feeling  My ex boyfriend and I were best friends before we dated   right after he just completely stopped acknowledging me as a person whatsoever  It sucks a ton but people you love treating you shittily usually has a lot more to do with them than you

Also the bus  It's a nightmare and i only use it for 10 minutes a day I can't touch anything there
Thank you 
I think before you deny yourself fulfilling your potential you should atleast ask yourself 1 question  have you tried everything  Therapy  Medication  Hell even just getting high helps some people cope  It's a very sad thing when depression overcomes one of us  were all soldiers fighting the same war  stay strong friend  3 
Please check out codependent   Google it   This might or might not be Your problem but it is worth looking into as Your problem is relationship based   There are 12 Step programs to help deal with codependence   I think Melanie Beattie is the name of the author that has written several good books on the topic  The book that clandestine12 mentioned is an awesome recommendation    As you have no doubt noticed  trying not to think about the situation doesn't really work that well    Codependence is a problem I deal with too  It is not fun but it can be managed and there is a way out of the torment   Good luck  
I get the same way  as a side effect of growing in a household with constant yelling  It's now been 14 years since I've moved out and I still get panic attacks around people yelling  even if not directed at me   The best I can advise is to distance yourself from people like that 
Please don't end your life  You aren't worthless  You may be going through a rough patch at the moment  but you can make it through this  You're an amazing person and I believe in you    
thanks man  actually  I'm not sure I can  I'm a fighter  but I lack the motivation atm  like why go forward  what for  I talked to my mom about needing her support  she's kinda indifferent  she favors my ex a lot  in the past she even told me that if we ever should split up  she's keeping her  I didn't do anything to provoke such comments from her  she just likes my ex so much for some reason  just shit stuff  glad I can even stay here atm  as for the girl  I wanna avoid putting any of this on her  I don't want a relationship revolving around my issues  I can't deal with them  she couldn't either  I will tell her about some of these things  but really  I can't expose her to the full extent of this  as she has anxiety issues as well  thank you for your kind words though  I appreciate you found the time to read through this and respond 
I think the biggest thing you need to do is stop practicing the compulsion  Let yourself think about his name  It's going to cause you anxiety  But the more you try not to think his name and give into those compulsions the more you feed your OCD and the stronger it becomes  Don't think of thinking of your ex as the problem  think of the problem is your OCD  It doesn't matter whether or not it's normal to be thinking about your ex at this point or not  You got this 
thanks ill try that sub 
So it doesn't really resolve anything just turns it down a little bit  I'm in 2 minds about them because I don't really want to become dependant on them for the rest of my life  But at the same time one can only fight mental illness for so long before caving in and collapsing 
These are a few tips I give to loved ones who want to support and be there for someone who is just opening up about their abuse    Listening with an open mind and a heart full of love to what they need to say in the way they need to say it    Using encouraging and supportive phrases so they know you are safe to talk to     Do not question or judge what he says   If parts don't make sense or you have your own emotional reaction  keep that to yourself until you can make sense of it   The focus is on his needs  not on your understanding    For a man to speak with another man about sexual abuse can raise fears that they will be judged on their masculinity   "Real men defend themselves " and other sorts of nonsense   Be aware he may have these fears and do your best to let him know that he is being brave now by talking about this   Simply opening up to you and being listened to and loved will do him a world of good in moving forward in healing    Encourage him to see a therapist who specializes in the trauma of sexual abuse  especially if they have experience working with males    Depending on what he says  you  could  raise the idea of reporting his abuser   Especially as it's a good bet that your brother wasn't the only kid he did this to   It's your brother's choice  but it's an option he may not have considered   Those are some basics   If you stick to those  you'll be on a good track to helping him   It's okay to cry with him and for him  but not for "your poor brother" out of pity   He's had the strength to make it through til now   And now he's reaching out   Give him a strong hand   This guide is written for men to support women through a rape sexual assault  but will have some good tips for you as well   Take a look  http   www capefearpsych org documents Rape mensguide pdf   Keep asking questions and writing here   If your brother would like some online help as well  he could post to  r mengetrapedtoo   They are a forum similar to this one  especially designed for men   All my best 
Dude stop helping people and be selfish  Your dad is bullshit and his stupid retarded ideology  It is good to be positive THAT IS IF YOUR OPTUMISTIC and look into the future knowing it will get better  And realistically you should only do things for others if they want it and don't care about how you feel unless you are are happy because they are content and obviously thankful  You should NOT do it because YOU think they need it or it makes you happy by giving shit away because there is a lot of people who are selfish and don't care and only want things  Especially if you might be doing it for recognition  it never will come  The shit you see on tv or reddit front page is a rare chance of recognition and sometimes for stupid people who happen to catch the publics eyes    Is this your money or your parents  If it is your parents  stop wasting it  If it is your do whatever you want    You know what it means to help people but you don't understand what it means to help people  You do a whole shit load of things but you haven't done alot of individual social worker things for the LONG term because they are the only who sit down and actually try to help people improve their life or cope  Your just giving pieces of yourself away for absolutely no goddamn reason but that fact that it is suppose to make you happy or see a glimps of a difference that you don't even know if you help create change or not    Forget helping people and be selfish for yourself for the time being  Go out and have fun  Experience life on your own terms  No some shit you need to do that it becomes a chore  People prey on nice people like you  They absolutely give two shits what you feel  Look man first have fun and understand what it means to make a difference and this time be more stingy in who you help  your not a millionare and this isn't a movie where everyone is thankful when you help every stranger 
I am so sorry this has happened to you  I understand how horrid you must be feeling  Remember that this is NOT your fault at all  no matter how drunk you are or who you chose to sleep with   what that man did is absolutely wrong on all levels  Can I ask if you have gone to get a rape kit done  or have thought about it  If you don't want to go ahead with prosecution right now  you can still get a rape kit done and then decide later  or never  to go to the police with it   If you are in the UK I can help with this and let you know what to expect   Sending my love to you 
Such strange times this new year is bringing 
Horrible to say but this is true   Really hope not for everyone 
I'm scared to get professional help because I don't want my friends and family to know I'm suffering  No one wants to know someone close to them is in pain  Maybe a part of me doesn't want to admit it either so I slept the day away  The other view of getting help though is that you're literally getting help  building strength  finding courage and actually opening up  Proving to not only yourself but loved ones that you're getting better  Which   they should he happy with instead of being constantly worried  You seem to know you're at the point you need help  So  If you don't do it for yourself then try thinking about getting help for the ones you care about  I'm not one to say anything bc I know this yet still am not getting help  Namaste  you encouraged just by responding with what you're going through  It's always nice to not feel so alone  To 2017 shedding some light on every person suffering 
We'd make some time  I suppose  to learn 
You sound so much like me  Im pretty much the same in my relationship  The first thing I can say is that checking his texts will only make you worse  you dont mention him ever being unfaithful  so Im not sure you can justify sifting through his messages  Please try to stop this as youll want to keep doing it  and its not healthy  sometimes its better just to not know  The other thing thats helped me is keeping a journal  I keep it on Google Drive and share it with my boyfriend  Then he can look at it and read my worries and insecurities  without me actually having to muster up the courage and talk to him about it  My only rules are that Ill never complain about him on there so he cant respond  thats unhealthy  and that he can bring up anything in person hes read on there and well talk about it  It means I can feel like Im getting stuff off my chest without venting to him and pushing him away putting pressure on him   Id be happy to talk more about it  as I always worry Im pretty much the only girlfriend in the world that acts like this  
Here are some of my goals that I want to achieve  1  Get a different job  2  Be less depressed  3  Don't be so worried about what others might think of me 4  Realize that its just panic attacks and to stop thinking that something is really wrong with me  5  Last year I finally actually got the confidence to ask a girl out so this year I want to continue not giving up and improve my social anxiety  
Have you gone to therapy  You CAN have the things you want  it will just take a shit ton of work  
Thank you for being a good friend to her  Your love and willingness to ask others for advice is very admirable  Have you talked to her about getting a rape kit done  She can always have it stored at the facility  and never involve the authorities if she doesnt want to  but it gives her the option to persue at a later point if she chooses to  
Same here  They don't even have to be yelling at me  Just a raised voice  My earliest memory of this was hearing my dad yell at the TV downstairs when football was on  Made my heart stop  
  might just have been a misunderstanding   Im not sure what could have been misunderstood about plans we had agreed on weeks prior    Besides  you have Internet   Some of the the slowest in the country  but sure  i guess i can enjoy waiting 30 minutes for a 10 minute video to load
That is because that is deep down you know you don't want to and not your mind  This is your true self    If this is your first time  it'll never get better next time  It'll only get worse with frequency not because you have them individually but you have them all the time   Put you mind off and do something  Play some epic orchestra music  Just do something  anything  Get out and go for a walk   I highly recommend this one or atleast go to your roof it is late and have a breather  You must be active    However if you don't want to do anything and sit around in the pain  There is nothing you can do except sleep it off  It is always a new day tomorrow  Or maybe talk to a friend or parent 
I'm apathetic to it honestly  I tried first by hanging which I gave up on because it hurt  then overdose  I didn't feel bad about it or anything when I initially took the drugs  and I remember thinking when the cop shook me awake "Damn  what does it take to kill me "  I don't really like the fact that I think that way  but I guess it's better than feeling sad about failing 
I had pretty much the same problem  My mum found out about my anxiety 2 years ago and denied it existed until a couple of months ago when she saw it first hand  There is a wonderful video on TheMighty about High Functioning Anxiety which may be useful to show her  Otherwise  I recommend confiding your worries when you've had a crap day to her  My mum started to recognise patterns in her own and my dad's thinking  and that may have been what changed her mind  It may take her a while   she's your mum so she likes to think she knows you  It might be hard for her to accept she doesn't know you as well as she thinks she does  but I think she will come round  I really hope she does 
This comes down to your philosophy as a parent   Do you believe it is worth telling "white lies" to your child to protect them allow them to enjoy childhood or do you believe they deserve an honest account of the world  even if it doesn't include every detail     I became a certified foster parent and after lots of thinking  the foster parent classes ask you to delve into yourself for a lot of answers to things you might never hopefully never have to use   I chose the latter   This question is one of the more simple questions and something every parent is going to deal with  so it is good to know your answer before you have difficult conversations   This even comes down to simple things like whether your kids believe in Santa and it is okay to have the first answer for certain circumstances and the second answer for others     From what you wrote and my philosophy  I would tell a six year old something like this  "I know you liked        but he can't see us anymore   It might be hard for you to understand  but he made a big mistake   He acted like he was going to hurt me  which is very serious   Because he acted like he was going to hurt me  he isn't allowed to see us any more   It doesn't mean that he doesn't love us  but he didn't know how to consistently show that he loves us   I know you love me   You know that I love you   We aren't going to be separated because we won't hurt each other  so I don't want you to worry   If you have any questions or want to talk about this  I'm here for you   If you don't have a question today  but think of one later  you can ask me when you think of it   Is that okay   Is there anything you want to ask or say "
Have you tried talking to a doctor  I think that's your best option 
Stay strong buddy  I get that the road ahead might be foggy  but just keep fighting  Maybe ask your mom if she would talk to you without bringing up your ex  As for your girl  make sure you know that she cares for you  and even if she has anxiety issues as well  maybe it's best for her to know some of this  You can keep pulling through this 
No work  no job lol 
Dying won't beat your problems  it just means they've beaten you  The human mind wants to survive it's a natural instinct  keep fighting  And I promise Oneday you'll think back on the moment you decide to carry on and thank every god  every heaven  every idea that you didn't take your life 
Yes   For me it's a part of bpd as well and nor has no much if an identity tbh
thank you  actually asked my mom  but she ignored me and kept reading her book  oh well  I will talk to my girl though  you're right  thank you once more 
I'm sure you could find something else to do
Try to book an appointment with your GP  they are the most qualified to diagnose someone with suspected depression  I've dealt with a bit of loss this year  which I've been able to handle in the past  but on Christmas eve a family friend of my parents died suddenly in a car crash  I think the shock triggered my depression  which I haven't dealt with for about 4 5 years  At first I was skeptical  I felt extremely tired and all I wanted to do was sleep all day  I tried to go to work but I would start panicking and crying  I didn't feel positive emotions like I used to and I find it difficult to do the things I used to love doing  All of these behaviors were out of character for me but I would still convince myself that I was just being a lazy peice of shit because I didn't want to get up and face reality  I  think because my last depression was so intense  loss of hope  cutting  thinking of suicide  I didn't think I had it again  Deep down I know that something is wrong  I was enjoying my work  I used to love reading and being creative  going outside and exploring  That one thought made me race to my GP  because depression is an evil bastard  it will do what it can to stick around  even convince yourself that it isn't there  So take my advice  even if you're second guessing yourself  even if you're tired  book an appointment  it's better to be safe than sorry   
I've never heard of CBT  Thank you for responding  I'm looking into it now   
Hi blue   Our sexual orientation or "preference" is a spectrum  but it is also fairly hard wired into who we are at birth   That's as much as we know about the genetics of it now   Possibly future research will teach us more   However  most of human history shows us that people  given a healthy  supportive outlet for expression  express their sexual orientation the same way throughout their lives     I'm not saying all that to change anything you're saying  just to put it in context   Certainly  there are people who "become aware" that they are gay later in life  but that's typically due to an attempt to conform to societal standards before that   All of that to say that what  is  more usual  is that when we've been through a sexual trauma  it can cause us  at a very deep level  to rethink how to avoid that trauma   In the case of sexual assault  an obvious way becomes to avoid becoming involved with someone of the gender that hurt us   It's not at all unusual for women to avoid being with men for some period of time after their assault  and for some  especially without therapy to work through the trauma  they stick with that decision for a long time     That's where the "could I be a lesbian " or "would I be willing to try a lesbian relationship " questions can come up     The chemical changes trauma causes can shift us absolutely  but they are typically shifting us away from whatever hurt us   Not changing our fundamental personality or orientation   My guess is that as you continue to work through what happened to you  you will slowly find yourself considering relationships with men again   Safe  caring men who you can have trust in   None of this is to say that you couldn't explore dating women to see how far these new feelings go   But from what you wrote  I get the strong impression that you are looking for safe relationships  not a sexual one with a woman   Does this make sense   
no problem  i hope you can find the love and support you need  don't give up on yourself  you're worth it  if you ever need to talk  my pms are open

I am so sorry this has happened to you  Just reading your post gives me anxiety   Drs in general give me anxiety and having to have an appointment for my meds makes me so anxious  I wish they would understand that if a person is taking anxiety meds then they should just give them a freakin refill  You can't just stop those meds cold turkey  Again  I am so sorry for you  I hope it gets worked out as soon as possible  
I understand completely  I've been on a steady spiral downhill slowly for 4years and all of a sudden the past 3months hit me severe of where my life has ended up  Had some clear mindedness today and took a old journal  ripped out all of the years of me writing about sadness  wrote 2017 goals on the cover  Inside cover said 2017 is about dedicating the same amount of effort I put into work  into myself for health and happiness  And wrote out some goals of what to never do again  start doing  financial  fresh start  It was really satisfying  Give it a try

I had this crazy manager at work pull me into a stockroom  slam the door  and scream in my face for like 5 minutes  I walked out crying and had a full blown episode for the rest of my shift  Took me 45 mins to stop crying  
SSRI withdrawals are no joke     Usually they taper you off   
Sometimes I look at the people in my life and I'm confused with how they're satisfied with their lives  living to go out and get drunk on the weekends   For what purpose  I just came to the conclusion that their minds must just not think about things on that level   
I know I'm oblivious  Most times I assume flirting is just them being nice  not them showing interest  
Thank you for this  You said  in much more eloquent terms of course  exactly what I wanted to say to that OP  Hopefully he feels some relief after reading it 
Thanks so much for your reply  If it helps  I'm a philosophy major  I actually love education and am totally fine with the idea of going to graduate school and living my life as an academic  My only problem with the school is the specific one that I'm currently at  I hate the environment  location  size  etc  However  what's keeping me from graduate school is mainly my lack of ability  I'm a good student  but not good enough to make it into a good  funded  PhD program  Even if I could  the job market afterwards would be too horrible to justify the decision  Like you  I have also looked at the medical field  But it's still a matter of my lack of ability  I got a B in gen chem 1 which isn't awful on its own but is definitely not good enough for medical schools  I'm actually continuing to take science classes for the pre med route but I know that eventually I will do poorly in enough of them to force me to do something else  What that something else will be  I have no idea  It's difficult to find a path when you suck at everything  I don't want to do this anymore

I'll comfort you    I've had that same feeling throughout my whole life  People yelling and then I get real nervous and unsteady and the anxiety skyrockets through the roof  then I am suddenly quiet and think I am worthless piece of shit that can't do anything correctly and I just want to cry and end up getting suicidal thoughts    Run on sentance much  I know how you feel  It is a terrible terrible feeling that no one should have to deal with    I'm 25 M and feel like such a pussy when this happens    Time is your friend  You can't make it come any faster and you can't slow it down  It sucks  I know it's not the answer you want to hear but it's what will get you through the day    I've made some pretty irrational decisions from incidents stemming from people getting pissed at me  yelling included     I'm here for you  mainly because it's comforting knowing that there is someone out there that feels the same way as me  Finding this community was one of the biggest steps forward of understanding why I am the way I am  Message if you'd like  I will do my best to respond promptly  
You are definitely not alone  Anxiety attacks are awful  I often feel like no one understands how I feel  I don't know if you are religious at all  but I find that repeating a scripture calms me down  If you aren't  repeating anything that you find comforting might help  
Hey   just one brief comment  I'm not qualified  but have read a lot around this area  To me what you're describing sounds like mania  as opposed to hypomania  I suppose I point this out as it makes it a little more serious   potentially  Best to get professional advice on it  anyway 
I know it's not a space  but i bring items that I usually have in that safe space  Sometimes it's my stuffed turtle i can hug in the car  or i have this little kitty stuffie my sister gifted me i can hold in my pocket so no one notices  This necklace i wear all the time with a rose quartz crystal used in crystal healing for love and especially self love  and although I don't believe too much in crystal healing I believe in the placebo of it  Really anything you can think of  you could bring  A lot of the time i'll bring crochet projects i'm working on for my safe space like a blanket for my bedroom  keeps my mind focused and centred on my room and the feelings it gives me  Sending happy thoughts and love  
Is there a video 
There is a lot of medicine and not every meds for every person  It takes time to find the right one because these meds hurts your organ if you go through alot too rapidly 
Thanks 
generally  as low self esteem and extreme lack of confidence   
I can't talk to people  it's like a wall or a barrier in my head  Everytime I get close or try I just reach a level of being uncomfortable that's so intense and makes me feel so overcome with anxiety that I feel like I'm going to freak out  
The same thing happens with me  I've had to constantly remind myself that people aren't mad at me and that yelling is often a way for people to express themselves  I feel lost when my SO is angry or upset about something totally outside of me  He might be grumpy or be explaining his situation to me and raising his voice out of frustration with the situation  not angry with me at all  but I always feel small  Sometimes I can't be as supportive or as good of a listener because I'm dealing with my own feeling of being scared like a child again  I'm getting better at reminding myself things don't always revolve around me and that I don't have to choose to be scared or offended by other's frustration  
Bro this kind of happened to me one time when i was meetin a bunch of girls with my friend at a bar and when i sat down in an empty chair  one girl was like "someones sitting there" i replied "well why tf is nobody sitting here then"  Activated my anger more than my anxiety but my anxiety wouldnt let me express my anger  Eventually the girl said she was just kidding but id never even met her so i thought it was kind of weird shed do that joke  But anyways  i can relate to your feeling
Fuck it whenever I see someone in Heely's I wish they made a comeback
What  u komorebi731 wrote is excellent advice    Including the high five to roommate  another from me    What your abuser is displaying are  very  typical stalker behaviors   He can't get through to you  so now he's trying another avenue close to you   I don't find it "weird " that he found her  I find it highly suspicious and completely deliberate on his part   This is intentional behavior designed to create fear in you and to get to you   There should be no communication from anyone  except as was suggested a clear "leave me and my friends alone "  One time   I would also suggest asking your family or other friends who knew him to let you know if he attempts to contact them   Save all messages from your roommate and yourself  if you still have them   If it continues at all  go to the police  show them the messages  and request a restraining order with a no digital contact clause     I don't say this to scare you  but to protect you   Often people do not take these situations seriously until something more intrusive happens     Definitely talk with your therapist about it   You are not overreacting   Keep writing and asking questions if we can be more helpful   All my best 
Lonliness huh  The hurt is real  I know man  You just wish someone understands you and just one moment where you can get a free handout of friendship where someone pops into your life and simply knows or at least empathize  The worse part of it the arguing is are you right or wrong  You know deep down that answer but you don't accept it because you don't know if it is your fault  Because what you think is not for yourself but what other people think of you  So instead you like to choose it is your fault  Because why not  you are a speck of dust and no one cares  Then sometimes you think why bother as a result  why bother  just give up  But look all you want is some reassurance  And I'll tell you your not wrong at those times  why because life happens and you get angry or you do something stupid  it isn't your fault  You might not get the chance to explain to everyone why you did it or people look with displeasure  It isn't your fault because deep down you know you are a good person and can do  you just happen to mess up at that moment  Once again IT ISN"T YOUR FAULT  It just happens  And you can fix it and maybe not every time   Being left out in the group  You act over enthusiastic because it is hard to connect with them  This is your only way to interact with them  You end up looking shallow and you keep doing this so you don't show you are hurt  So you try being serious and more intimate but only to find it is hard and only to come out as weird  Being social is hard  there are more acquaintances than friends and we use the word friends so shallowly these days  But you have to keep trying   You know something else that is hard and hurts  its when you say something by accident to a friend and it might be your fault or theirs but it doesn't matter  You know why  Because deep down you need them  The best thing you can do is to apologize regardless of who is wrong  You might feel vulnerable  Very very vulnerable at that time but the truth is you look very strong because you allow yourself in that position of vulnerability  Whether they continue to be your friend or not  you'll see who they really are  It is good he is out of your life  Perhaps he was tolerating you politely but finally reach his limit   Are you weak  NO  You have experience most people who live so happily but never had a hard life  You experience your humanity  the fight between right and wrong with yourself and caring about other people maybe not in the right what like what they think of you  but you know what it feels to hurt  What it feels to be lonely  The truth it is you are stronger than ever   It doesn't matter if other people had it worse  you understand one thing we all share  Pain   There is just one problem  You've been hurting for so long but just this one moment where you get betrayed it hurts  So what can you do  I know you still have good days left  The good days where you wake up and you feel like your can do it  Or atleast you wake up feeling amazing even as life hits you later in the evening  Look this is where you can dig yourself out and go make friends  new friends  This is the hardest part and there is no way around it  Not being lonely but building yourself back and throwing out more tears because this is the time where you fail alot and it will hurt EVEN MORE  But you have to do it  It will take time  days  weeks  or month  Just keep fighting  Keep fighting to good fight  There is no way around this but go out and have fun and make friends  how  Find out how  Not everyone will understand so you have to make them understand  
That was me last night  I'm home from college with my family who doesn't really like to do very much  in a town where there isn't much to do  I was checking my snapchat Facebook twitter and seeing all my friends having fun with their friends and families and I hated myself for not having the guts to ask any of my friends from high school to do anything  and feeling afraid these friends I do have from school are gonna be shitty to me this year  I barely was able to fall asleep and when I woke up the multiple times in the middle of the night it was more of the same  I ended up staying in bed until around 11  but woke up  managed to get a shower  ate some pork  and went and watched the needlessly hectic Steelers game and managed to suppress some of the invasive thoughts  They're still there a bit  but I have to look forward  
Always try to believe in better future  I'm kind of young to say this but you are getting stronger when you become older  I have been depresses like ten years now  and it's worse than ever right now  but I still think i'm sirviveing cause i'm gettin older and stronger and I still can build my future better  First of all  if you have not told anyone about your feelings do it now  It really helps  Try to get help to your problems cause like that you can get hope and power to win your battle  Don't waste your life  you are important 
People who are angry are often just mad at themselves just walk away
That's what  u Pizzachu1 does best  mock the pain of everyone around him but whine when someone gives him a taste of his own medicine 
I'm not sure on your religious beliefs and honestly it doesn't matter but many people would take that sense of "what does it take to kill me" as a sign that you aren't meant to die yet   I like to think were all intricate cogs of this thing we call life  everybody has a part to play  no matter how small  and none of us can leave before were supposed too
OP have you watched Taxi Driver  that movie made me realize there was no need to fret over my loneliness  I try to watch films that won't put me in that morbid mood  Somehow I get peace from The Big Lebowski or Workaholics  like atleast i'm not as big of a screwup as those characters  I also avoid watching things on tv with ads  if you have on demand use it  It will shelter you from the bullshit that media puts on you  Life is not how it is in commercials and its easy to fall in that mindset Books are good too and can calm anxiety if you have trouble sleeping  Read something your interested in  i browse cook books at night and read things like Homicide by David Simon cause I loved the show The Wire  Or read about sports or whatever fills that void  I hope things get better for you 
I've taken 3 pills each of the last 3 days  I work night shift  50mg    Definitely been stressed  even so  the last 3 days have been some of the best sleep I've had in awhile  I'm getting 5 7 hours as opposed to 4 5   I usually wake up every hour or two  the first day I still did that  but I was able to fall back asleep in just a minute or two  Still felt panicked when I woke up  but WAY less    The last 2 days however I slept the whole time  haven't done that in months   In general my depression seems better  didn't expect that  especially after only 3 days  maybe it's just from better sleep  My anxiety is MUCH better  that was the biggest factor    I read in several places where people called it a miracle drug  best thing ever for their situation  which sounded like mine  I wouldn't go that far with it  but it has definitely met my expectations  and takes the edge off just enough for me to function normally again    I would say for some with major depressive disorder  like me  that's also got some anxiety and sleep trouble  this so by far the best thing I've had 
When I stopped Effexor for the second time  I took St  John's Wort  B Complex  Aleve  Fish Oil  and lots of Green Tea  It helped a lot I think  
If you want advice  use this opportunity to notice how even though  there was a negative result  you are still you   your value hasn't gone down  etc  and you're still alive  etc    If you just want someone to talk to  I'm sorry you had a shitty new years and that that happened  I broke cultural traditions a lot on accident when I lived abroad and was dating someone there  it is so anxiety inducing and even shameful sometimes  you're not trying to offend anyone but it's like it'll happen regardless of what you do  It sounds like it's more so their fault for not letting you know  I hope the rest of your year is better 
It's a symptom of anxiety  Happens to me all the time  
That stripper sounds like a cunt  I don't blame you for your actions  but it's a shame the consequences will be severe  Best of luck to you  
Do not get the hubbub about kids  my sister had one a year ago and her  her partner and the kid are all back here living at home in the family home from abroad with me and our parents for several months and it seems everyone but me believes it the greatest thing to happen in eons and above all else in considerations so obviously i'm the mean nasty one 
It's not that uncommon for people with OCD to ruminate on unwanted images  which just causes them more distress  That happened to me where I would ruminate on the thought of the person I was in love with having sex with someone  It may sound like heartbreak  but OCD obsessiveness definitely contributed  I would think about it almost all the time  and it always made me feel panicked and sick   I don't know if this will help in your situation  but what helped me was warping the image in my head into something else  When I would picture them having sex  I would make the hair on my friend longer  change his facial features  and then give him some crazy name that would make me laugh  This way  since it turned into someone else having sex  it didn't bother me 
It's hard for me to say because my doctor had me start on a smaller dose of Lexapro and increase it a bit each day as I was lessening the Effexor  So  I felt bad for two     days until I started feeling more stabilized due to the Lexapro  Effexor has a shorter half life compared to Lexapro  so I would hope it is not too long for you  I was only on it three weeks  though  I've read stories online from people who have been on it a long time and felt bad coming off it

Congratulations on taking this step  I'm sure you won't regret it and I hope it helps you be happier    
You don't know me  I get so close to pulling myself out of whatever the hell hole I'm in and something just knocks me back to the bottom  
I haven't seen it but I will check it out  it does look interesting  Thank you
op you are amazing    I also saw your post replying to everyone and I think you need to listen to your own advice cause it's good and you have it in you     message anytime    
As survivors we tend to minimize what we experienced  I don't know for certain but it may be a way of coping   If the same had happened to your sister or friend  would you minimize it  Maybe spend some time thinking about what you would say to someone if they came to you to share the same situation of abuse   Sexual abuse doesn't have to be violent  He coerced you into complying by threatening to kill himself if you didn't comply  He did not have your voluntary permission to engage in sexual acts  That is what makes his behavior sexual assault   He also tried to convince you that engaging in these acts would be good for your anorexia  Not physical force but definitely coercion   I wish you the best with your psychotherapy  Continue to take good care of yourself 
It's the only medication that has effectively treated my depression  It's not perfect  of course  but it has made a big difference   I had some minor side effects when I started it  but they all wore off over time  It's great to have an antidepressant that doesn't kill my sex drive or make me tired   I've been on antianxiety medication the entire time I've been on lamictal  so I can't judge for sure whether it does anything to help with my anxiety on its own  However  I'd guess that it's not doing anything for that    I'm taking 300 mg of extended release once a day  if that helps 
Hi MintGiraffe   Welcome to the forum   Thank you for introducing yourself and telling us about your background   I'm the lead mod for  rapecounseling and also a mod for  rape   It's always great to have more support here  especially someone with your background and understanding of the complexities of sexual trauma   In the states  we call what you do an "advocate " but it sounds like you have more training and education than a standard advocate here   An advocate here goes through a 40 80 hr training  depending on the work they will be doing  either in person support  hotline work  med exam support  or additional domestic violence intervention   If you're open to it  what I'd recommend outside of your post  is simply to read through the posts and comment as needed given their situation   I wish I had more time to devote to this  which is why it's so appreciated and amazing when people step forward to help   Happy New Year   And feel free to ask me anything you'd like about the forums   All my best 
Good advice
Bro 77kg at 1 80 isn't overweight  That sounds fairly normal to me  depending on your age  You're probably not nearly as fat and ugly as you think 
You live your life for yourself  Don't plan it around someone else's but focus on your own life and find what it is that you want
Good news  went to the ER and they refilled my meds no problem  Even the lady who checked me in said "Honey  I understand and  I'm grateful for my medication" and then squeezed my hand  Her compassion filled me with strength to keep fighting this awful illness  I'm at the pharmacy now  Thank you for your kind words  though I'm sorry I caused you anxiety  There's hope for us  never forget that  I wish you a well controlled  symptom New Year   
Not the way the majority of people would expect  It helps you  cope  with the feelings and not do anything risky  I'm on my second month on Prozac and I'm still depressed  but can still somewhat function  As of before  I couldn't even get out of bed   and I still do have those days      It's honestly up to you if it's worth it  I mean  they're designed to help with your depression so I don't see why not  
that sounds shitty bro  blast some music on and chillax  give urself a break for a day or two 
i hope so too
Look up the affects of overdose for your medication  I'd recommend waiting for your appointment but if you're going to do it anyway you should understand the risks 
I believe in you  I know it's rough that this keeps happening  But eventually  you're going to try and succeed and feel great about that  Stay strong 
No  he is looking for people who have successfully gotten out from depression  But this sub is just a whole sub of sad people with very few people who give insightful response 
Oh ok  I understand the hating your actual school  I can totally see how that would be frustrating  I don't know a whole lot about philosophy  but I do know how hard it can be to get into a good PhD program  I've always loved science  but excelled much more in the language arts type subjects  So the lack of ability is something I have struggled with in my areas of interest  as well  One thing I've thought about in the past is something Entreprenuer ish  but these days even that requires a business degree  If only the world still ran on apprenticeships   they're able to be found  it just isn't easy  Good luck on your endeavors  though

I'm pretty similar  When I was talking to the gen doc's therapist  I explained how I had tried to get myself to do exposure  but it often backfired  She made a point that made me stop completely  "yes  exposure is a great way to get over anxiety  but you sometimes have to be prepped to do it  You haven't been seeing a therapist  and so you're just throwing yourself to the wind without understanding what steps you should be taking " It really opened my eyes that for someone like me  who is a planner  I can't just throw myself into situations I don't understand haven't discussed with someone who better understands  I still do slight exposure exercises  but I don't do something new without  well  planning  I talk to my therapist  I research common ways to manage the situation you're going into  etc  Don't think that exposure is the only way  If it's not working out for you and making it worse  then you need to not do it  It's okay  there are tons of other ways to go  cbt works wonders for me

Idk guess I was just looking for an easy fix  No such luck in this world I guess ah
Okay  I understand  Are you able to talk with those people about what you're going through 
I think the biggest thing I have learned in my life is that happiness isn't about becoming a better version of yourself or necessarily changing who you are  it's about looking at yourself without judgement  really getting to know yourself  and being comfortable in your own skin  Us people with SA are notoriously bad about negative self talk  Self compassion is one of the most rewarding habits you can practice  And that's the other thing  It's all a practice  Everyday you have to love yourself  every day you have to tell yourself you are worth it  and everyday you have to remind yourself to just go do that thing you want to do  Don't think about it  don't try to do it  DO IT  If your brain kicks in with "but what if " Tell it to shut up  and just do the things that make you feel good  Your brain will always win and keep you down if you let it  So just tell it to shut up for a while 
It helped me alot and also reddit has replace Facebook in a positive way 
Sorry meant Cognative behavioral therapy   Brain fart
OK  Why not  
i wish i had your courage  dealing with this since july 2016    alone
What was the text to help you with social anxiety if you don't mind  We are very similar it's weird I'm at a loss of words  What happened to us is completely different but fundamentally we face practically the same issues  I can't relate on not having hope  There must always be hope even a small amount and I think you do have the will to get better  I don't think you would have reached out and wrote your experience if not  We all just want to feel a connection   You may be interested in the philosophy of absurdism  It's essentially that we has humans have this inherent drive to find meaning in life and put values towards things  But we as humans can't find those answers   You can't grasp that you wasted you're life because it never happened  Nothing that we do in this life is a waste  I won't be able to forgive myself  or ever truly accept the past  i know I'll still have breakdowns and it's going to be a struggle to climb back up out of this hole but the thing is  That is okay  Learn from your past to not continue doing the same bad habbits  No one says you need to accept your wrongs but you do need to know them to not do them   I heard "heros don't become by doing big things but by doing what's right " Idk where  But we all have to strive to be our own heros and do what's right   Thank you for responding I'll try to take on my own advice for you and work on my self sabotaging behavior 
I don't know about LinkedIn  It's like Facebook in that it is a tool for people to promote the best version of themselves which is not good for you if you have a tendency to compare yourself with others    I say avoid social media all together  Deactivate your profiles if you have to 
Good for you  I have anxiety about posting on Facebook but on Reddit I'm fine
They have been more or less dicks to me all my life  comparing how they treat others  But the last few months have been especially pain  This day was broke the camel's back 
I've had moments where I'd bottleneck because I had so much I wanted to do  what usually happens is you do something that motivates you to do another thing  So I'd say the first two things would be a license and drinking  Smoking is harder of course  If you get your license you have a better chance to get a job  Get a job  and slowly come off of smoking    And I wouldn't consider what was said shortcomings  You having this attitude towards wanting to change is much more then most people have when in a rut  Someone in my life is stuck in a rut and they have no drive or desire to change     A lot of baby steps can equal a mile  Take your time and take bites out of what you want to do 
I went to Navy boot camp  gave up and came home because I was told I might have depression and then a doctor said I had it and social anxiety  I also felt I wasn't entitled to call my depressed  I couldn't even get pass boot camp and see war  my dad even said I was looking for attention 
and how do you meet new people and make new friends  because facebook is the only way i can find out people
Thank you so much  This is really helpful to read  and validating  and reassuring  and comforting  You take care too  
Find some new hobbies or fun things to do  even if they're super simple  Maybe this will help you be happier    Stay strong  I believe in you 
We met playing an online game  we stayed up all night talking  then spent the next ten months talking everyday  We tried to just talk every second day but it wasn't enough  We met in person and it was basically perfect  Don't get me wrong  I was so insanely nervous before I met him that I curled up in a ball and called my best friend out of a meeting  I drank an apple cider in the shower and had a full scale anxiety attack during dinner  But it went away  And then it was just gone   I went on some dates  not a lot  I was always too shy  If it started getting close with a guy I would usually make fun of him or find another way to push him away  Just to stop the panic 
My sexual addiction is killing me  Its one fucking day into the new years and i have fucked two random people   Slut  
Currently job hunting  hoping having a job will help out  That job search depression is really kicking in though unfortunately  
Um   okay   
Hmm thanks for the tip   I started a couple shows and series but always got bored after a couple episodes   But I will give the shows you recommended a try should I find them online   
I would like to know others' thoughts on this as well  It's something I've been considering  I've been afraid to try because it makes the thoughts more "real" in some sense  Like  they're out there on a page  virtual or otherwise   But I'm going through a real rough patch right now and I could use the help that journaling may be able to provide  I guess I'm just restating what was already said 
Feel you there  I was happy and with friends last night and thought maybe I would get a momentary break in the depression  but it came back with a vengeance this afternoon and i've been in a slump ever since  
If you have a bit of spare cash  should be about  150 500 ish dollars depending on how good of a bike you want   you could get an exercise bike  I love mine  It's a Schwinn  It works amazing  but that brand is pretty expensive  got it at a clearance price though which was pretty great   It does have loads of settings though  and resistance levels that shift at the push of a button   Exercise bikes are amazing   you don't have to go outside  so no worries about running into people or  if you're like me and your throat can't handle the cold air  you won't have throat pains  They're also a lot easier on your joints  because they don't have to carry your full weight  I have joint issues so even at a normal weight mine aren't friendly to long walks or running   Another great thing about exercise bikes is that you can do other things to keep your mind off the 'burn' of the workout  Want to watch TV  Want to play games  You can  Bring out that handheld or console and go to town  I biked over 11 miles today because the new Pokemon game distracted me  That's way more than i've done in a LONG time  normally I go for 2 5 miles about 3x week    I would also recommend a small set of weights  I have 5 lb weights because whatever health issue I have makes it so I can't really handle much more than that without my joints feeling like they're being pulled apart       But they do make me feel better  I'm also planning on getting a stress ball  to try to strengthen my finger joints   If you don't have money to buy things  all is not lost  Dance is free  as is yoga  and much more  You could try looking up exercise routines on Youtube 
Thank you for sharing  I would be very frustrated if I were in your shoes  I understand caring and being supportive  but acting like nothing is wrong  or not even acknowledging issues pisses me off    Personally I don't like being called "uncle " It makes me feel like the only reason I'm acknowledged is because of my blood relationship  I want my family to know and accept me for who I am and not because of a hereditary relationship 
Great advice  Thanks for posting that 
Wow  congratulations  You definitely should be proud    
Yes  All I'm thinking about is how I used to go to wild New Years parties have fun  flirt with girls  be relaxed  All of this seems impossible to me now and I'm just alone
Don't get too let down  job rejection happens to the best of us 
Me  Yes    For me  it comes from a traumatic childhood  I try to remind myself that I'm a grown up now  and I can keep myself safe  Also  I won't hesitate to completely cut off someone who makes me feel unsafe in every way I can  Whether that's blocking a dickhead on FB or shutting off emotionally from a coworker  etc  
That's sucks man  
what  
You'll find some relief by forgetting what's happened in the past  becoming unattached to things you cant control  and just trying to maintain your attention on the present moment  It sounds like a lot of your pain and anger are coming from outside forces you can't control  Just let go and be present  There's very little happening to you RIGHT NOW that is causing you any harm  There is a lot of relief to be found in this fact  Just my thoughts 
hi  thanks for your concern which i did consider but i needed so badly to finally let it out of me that i went ahead   i can always not log on if somebody tries to bother me   i do know the whole thing was bullshit now of course  but i'm not sure about therapy just yet   i do feel a little better so far   very selfishly  i haven't tried to report what happened because having everyone in my life know about it is just not something i can consider as a possibility   which i also feel pretty shitty about 
Can you tell me why you want to die 
You say it could have been worse  but there aren't too many worse things than a "friend" threatening to kill themselves if you don't do what they want   That is a violent form of blackmail with an insidious twist to it   He may not have directed the actual violence at you  but he did threaten you with violence   Towards himself   And then tried to say that it was for your good   This is an extremely manipulative and horrible way to treat someone you say you care about   He used your vulnerabilities against you   It's very little different from how adults will manipulate children in grooming them for sex   Not that you are a child  but that this was his approach demonstrates clearly he had no interest in your well being   He was willing to torture you emotionally so that he could get what he wanted sexually     It was violent and abusive   Just in a way that made you doubt yourself   Which makes it harder to pin down and more confusing than if he just hit you   This is why emotional and psychological abuse are often harder to recover from than straight physical abuse   I hope this helps you to re contextualize what he did   It's one thing for us to contemplate hurting ourselves and another entirely to be made to feel responsible for someone else's life   Good luck on your narrative   I use those often with my clients and they are very helpful in getting your experience down where you can better see it   All my best 
Good on you for taking that step  I'm proud and I hope one day too I can go to the movies without having Anxiety   
In the same boat  but I only had 1 friend   and I lost him  Fuck 
Feel free to Pm me if you just need someone to talk too   
I slept through New Years eve for the first time last night  went to sleep at 10 45 and my family couldn't believe it  I think we ought to stop being so reckless and want death so badly  because    I feel for a lot of problems people have  there is a way to mend it  and if there isn't  you can at least try to find it with all your might 
Nice job  Do you feel like you could take on other classes now  
How do you feel about explaining to her how you're feeling 
Depression is not something you choose  All of our behavior can be traced to physical biological and environmental phenomena  You certainly didn't choose these things  Don't feel ashamed for the way you feel  That just makes the problem worse 
I think you should definitely do it  Not only would it help you  but it would also most likely aid in breaking barriers  and maybe someone you have on facebook sees your post and decides to post about their experiences with anxiety as well  Keeping the lines of communication and breaking the stigma is one of many things we as a collective need to work on  and even small things like posting on facebook about it helps  albeit on a smaller scale than you'd imagine   Either way it still makes a difference 
yep  well i might be emotionally immature stunted so verbal interactions does not do much for me as physical interactions  BUT if someone doesn't want to talk to me I would definitely feel they might not like me and then I become sad  Like if someone hugged me for an hour and didn't say anything I would feel very good  if someone spent an hour talking to me I would feel okay to good  but if someone spent an hour ignoring me I would feel really bad  Also with talking you can kind of do that at any time with anyone  Have a chat with the cashier or the mailman  Or post something on reddit or youtube  For physical things  you can't just run up to someone and hug them or hold their hand 
Going through the same exact thing right now  I'm so sorry you're dealing with this too 
That's an interesting take on it  I do remember being kind of excited to finally figure out who wins the afterlife debate  but I guess I have to wait a little longer
This is a tough thing to go through  especially alone  do you have anybody supporting you 
I wish I would just die  I hate myself  Nothing matters  I'm pathetic  And disgusting 
Perfect metaphor  
 removed 
I agree with you  The tricky part is that in a way these social media  IG  FB  whatever  is MADE to make the person look better   be it the filter  angles  caption  blah blah blah   It's hard when you really are going through things and you're bombarded with people's pictures about their birthdays  parties  celebration of some sort  work success and gifts   because they WANT  you to go "OMG yaaaaay you "  I have no problem congratulating someone and being happy for someone genuinely   Don't line the shit up strategically  at an angle  with some stupid hashtag   blessed or  besthusband or something like that  and expect ALL of us to fawn over that  you know  There's a difference between someone finishing a masters degree and someone humble bragging over a bouquet of flowers or a bracelet  from their BF   
How's your relationship with your family  Could you stay with them 
Can you tell me what's making your run so hard  darling 
I love the rhythm  Excellent work 
One of the nice things about memes is that they usually get screenshot and reposted to pretty much every website ever   I'm glad the change so far has had a good effect  I deleted my FB a while back and it's honestly alleviated my stress levels so much 
It took a few months for Zoloft to work for me  Then I felt wonderful but now I feel like shit again     So I'm planning on talking to my psychiatrist about switching  
Honestly  I think it would help to be in a sunnier place   Not saying it would cure depression  but even just being able to spend more time outside would make me at least feel a bit better 
Me too  Just please promise me to not make a plan  That's what I promise myself all the time  If I do make a plan  then I might as well consider myself dead then and there 
Man I'm so glad I found them  thanks to you 
In so much that I appear fine and normal since the pills are "fixing" me  Otherwise it isn't spoken about  Thanks for asking 
Stay strong friend and pray this all makes sense to us someday  I don't identify with any religion but I have to believe in a god or I couldn't cope  
I take benzodiazepines as needed for anxiety  It works for me  I have mostly good days  but sometimes I have a string of bad days where a low dose  usually 0 5 1 MG  helps me function  I have concerns about taking an every day maintenance medication  stems from my abusive mother  she was prescribed Prozac and made me take her prescription as a child with some negative side effects  so feeling like I have control over the dosing stopping the medication when I want is best  I've read posts where people act like you take benzos once and you're hardcore addicted  but that is not my experience  I take them every day for 2 7 days  then not for 10 15 days  etc    I was nervous about talking to my doctor  but when I finally did  it was SO routine to him  He didn't judge me or make me feel bad  I felt very empowered by finally admitting I needed some help  Along with that  a vigorous exercise routine and mindfulness practices help me manage my anxiety  
I feel the same way  Especially last night  Just take all my meds and have it over  I can't though  I love my family too much and don't want to destroy their lives  I feel alone  Nothing good is happening  I have no job  Guy i was seeing for over two months is gone  Just feel alone  
I feel like this too  On the surface  my life looks great  Even my therapist says I'm making great progress but I don't agree and I feel like I'm stuck in a hole that I have no idea how to climb out of 
Okay  how do you feel about that 
I don't always want to   I'm an intelligent  above average  certainly   creative  curious individual  and I honestly have a lot of things going for me in that sense   But I can't motivate myself   I struggle to see any purpose to my life  the point  etc  etc    However  it's not all the time   When I'm not depressed  I feel very positive and enthusiatic   I have lofty goals   It comes and goes   The depressive episodes are actually "better"  but   the good times are becoming more muted   I feel defeated even then   I enjoy things I used to less   Even my curiosity dims   My talents and abilities are wasting away   I've fought for years  Since I was a kid  even before my teen years   I've swung back so many times  but I am slowly losing the battle   Every episode erodes me more and more    I am like a boulder on a jetty   I have been strong  but the ebb and flow of the sea is relentless   Eventually the water will reduce me to but a caricature of what I once was  my potential  a husk of myself   I intend to wait about 5 years  and if my trajectory still aims for this outcome  stop it by any means necessary   The pain  the lack of anything worthwhile   The cons outweigh the pros   Perhaps I'll go on a spiritual pilgramage or something  try to find an alternate mode of living   Perhaps I'll already have explored that path sufficiently by then   If that fails  there's not much left 
That doesn't help OP 
I appreciate the words of encouragement  I think in writing a book  I left a little to be desired  It's nice to see that I got a response  I do want away from here  but even that's tough  I hope 2017 holds meaning for me  I need to move forward   Also trying to get a CDL and pesticide applicator's license  I feel so behind still yet  I need this to be a year in which I move forward 
Tired  Numb  but Raw
I'm too embarrassed to say this at therapy  I'm bad at it  I don't want people knowing things about me lke this
I personally found the beta blocker propranolol helpful  Traditional psych meds have never worked for my OCD anxiety  I ran out of other options and in the hospital  the psychiatrists asked if I wanted to try something different  I didn't have anything else to do  so I agreed  Best decision I've made  
I suggest getting into therapy with a therapist who specializes in sexual trauma  A great workbook that helped me a lot is Resurrection After Rape by Matt Atkinson  If you ever need someone to talk to  I'm here for you  You can get through this  
I was at a small party with friends  It was a good time  But not one Happy New Year text  It's strange  I got a Happy Thanksgiving from a friend and a few Merry Christmas texts  but nothing for the New Year   Makes me wonder if Facebook is further drawing people away from being connected to one another
Okay  How do you feel about therapy 
Thank you  I believe in you  Baby steps   
This is just normie spewing garbage  This shit doesn't fix years of trauma and mental illness  I'm never going to marry and have kids  This I know for fact  My depression doesn't let me get close to any woman  It doesn't matter how buff I get  what degree I achieve  or how much money I make  I will never feel normal or achieve that same amount of normacy as others  And I will suffer for years because of it 
A fellow shadow lurker
I believe our age demographic needs its own subreddit  because in GFD I often feel surrounded by high schoolers   Depression is a different beast when you still have it at 35  as I do  I'm also sick and possibly dying with an antibiotic resistant infection of the colon  I am alone  not stuck around family  and many things in life are behind me  not in front of me  I have lost my wife   I do not care about AAA releases  When you've gamed for as long as we have  you've pretty much seen it all before and  big shock for you young people  it's all been done better   Most gaming I do now is with my one close friend  and it's usually pool and golf  sometimes a racing game  I used to be a Quake clan player when I was in high school   I had an experience last year playing "Hockey Question Mark"  an obscure first person hockey game  on a team in a league  I'd always wanted to play hockey growing up  but it wasn't possible   I was the oldest person on my team by 15 years  Grandpa Clone  they called me  I still enjoyed my team mates but  not surprisingly  got along with the oldest among them  at 24  the best  He was my defensive partner  so that was nice  All the others were under 18   It was fun  but their immaturity was evident  and frustrating at times   pushing the league rules  getting us in trouble with the league management  for fun instead of focusing on our strategies and our skills  When they were doing this B S  and I asked them how old they were  They were offended   no one older than 24 is offended by a question about age    "Why should that matter  "  Read this post  and you will know why it matters   Edit  And now  to emphasize even more  I reached out to a member here who said he "knew exactly where I was coming from" in a post about my age and how I feel this might not be the right place for me  I invited him to possibly play with my friend and I  After looking at his post history though  I was quite disturbed  "FUCK OFF FAGGOT " and "STFU " all over the place  I sent him a message telling him I'd seen this  and asking him his age and why he thinks he's mature  what makes him believe he is  He exploded at me  exclaiming that I had autism  the friend I was inviting him to play games with HAS autism  WOW  No compassion  What a toxic bunch teenagers can be  What a toxic cess pool  Sorry kids  I feel like I've washed up on the beach at some kind of Chuck E  Cheese's version of "Lord of the Flies"   The deleted post in reply to this one was nearly as toxic as my interactions with this member  Thank you mods   If anyone thinks the experience of depression isn't dramatically different when you're a teenager compared to when you're an adult  I would hazard to guess that you have yet to experience the latter  If you had  you would know  The pressures are different and the sadnesses are different  It takes the brain until 24 or 25 to finish development  and it takes the heart even longer   If any older gamers with depression see this message and want to connect with me privately  please PM me   Goodbye GFD  and good luck in the new year to everyone 
Not good  we rarely talk 
How come 
Wow mate calm down  some people clearly found it useful no need to be a dick  I didn't say this will fix all your problems did I  You clearly have issues just like everyone else on this thread  hence forth it being depression  So instead of being a cunt why not speak to people and ask for help  
  BUT if someone doesn't want to talk to me I would definitely feel they might not like me and then I become sad   You remind me of my grandma  She think i don't like her or don't want to have a conversation with her  To put it up to 11  i could phrase it as "People think i don't want to talk with them because i hate them  but in truth i don't want to talk with them because i hate myself"    Also with talking you can kind of do that at any time with anyone  Have a chat with the cashier or the mailman   Nah  that's different  I was fully opened with only one person in my life  now it's less than that 
I can second this  lol
I've done it many times  This last time was for about 2 3 years  I felt i overstayed  hit their limit to what they could do to help  I liked them but they have moved further away and I don't have the amount of money needed    I feel pathetic that I have to pay someone to listen to me    I don't mean any offense 
I am pretty sensitive to people's anger as well  Not just yelling  but when I sense someone getting upset or frustrated it bothers me so much and I get all worked up  I catch myself reacting to anger before I even process what I am doing sometimes   For example  one day my boyfriend got the car stuck in snow while we were driving  and he loudly and angrily said a single swear word  I immediately started telling him it was okay and not to get upset  but then started processing and realized it's totally okay to get upset in that situation  It really made me think about the way I react to things and start working on that with cognitive behaviour therapy 
Do NOT just taking them  It can shock your brain  and my doctor told me that it's "the equivalent of throwing your brain off a bridge "   You have to taper  Slow and steady    Trust me  I did that and it was the worst thing that I could've done  
Okay  How's your support system 
Okay  I understand  Did therapy help you 
If 2016 taught me one thing  it's that I'm not capable of being happy on my own  I simply don't possess the right skills to be able to live a fulfilling and successful life  it's unfortunate but it's just the way I turned out  thanks mom and dad  I need someone something to hold my hand and walk me through the dark  because apparently I'm blind   2017 goals   1  Talk to a psychiatrist psychologist therapist whateverist to finally confront my shit  including SA of course  depression  self esteem image issues  what's causing me to self harm  and  possibly  unresolved childhood traumas    2  Go back on SSRIs  3  Drink more  I know this is a very terrible solution that will most definitely turn me into an alcoholic  but I don't know if I can or want to stop  Even just a drink or two works wonders for me and turns night into day  not necessarily in regards to how I act but mainly how I feel  Not even at the point of being drunk  just "mellowed out " just something to take the edge off  and it is a very sharp edge   The danger here is that once I start drinking  once I realize how good I feel  I just want more  I just figure "if it makes me feel increasingly awesome  why not keep going " and it's amazing at first feeling completely at ease and confident and attractive like a normal person  but before I know it I'm on my knees in the bathroom at 4am throwing up in the toilet and waking up the next morning in my clothes with a headache and upset stomach feeling this horrible mix of guilt and shame and disappointment in myself  then I do it again a week later  I just need to learn how to drink socially and in moderation  
This is on point  Exactly how it goes  Grr
Most people here do speak to people and ask for help   Asking for and getting help do not "cure"  anything though   
How often does it happen for you 
Yeah  these holidays are bad for depression  Many of us are single and when we see everyone together for the holidays  it reminds us of how lonely we are  And I'm so glad 'The Holidays' are over  but then remembered that Valentines day is a month and a half away  FUCK  I was friend zoned about a month ago now  Valentine's day is gonna be such a bitter and horrible thing  especially this year 
I actually am doing fantastic on Luvox   I definitely agree that it takes time to find the right "fit "  Everyone's brain is different 
You shouldn't be embarrassed  You can't help that you have OCD  but you can help the degree to which it affects your life  Trust me  therapists have heard much weirder  I know it may seem embarrassing but once you get it out there and start getting help you'll be glad you did    
I've explained to her how stressful the past few months have been and she always apologizes to me  I don't want her to feel like a burden  but sometimes I think she does  And then I feel bad even complaining because I know how difficult it's been for me  so I can't even imagine how hard it's been for her   
I have a PRN medication hydroxizine  And trazadone was prescribed but I didn't care to start it 
At first  but then  like all things  they lose their power or something 
I have no job or social life atm so that makes it worse than it probably would be  and also means all the ongoing "issues" are mine despite everyone here being some calibre of f up or another or we wouldn't all be living here  parents are divorced  sister partner don't have alot of money etc   I get the uncle crap too  someone holds her and gets her to point at me and call me uncle  made my feelings clear about that which has made me the ahole of course  Have kids all you want  just don't expect others or the world to deem it as important or amazing as you do 
Hi  Sorry to hear about your struggles and your friend  I hope your friend is doing okay    I mean this respectfully  but can you update your psychiatrist when you get the chance  Do your best and be as proactive as you can be  You don't have to wait until your next appointment to tell your psychiatrist how you're doing  You can call and leave a message  or you can write a note and drop it off at their office 
Hello  I saw your post in  r stackadvice  You might be get a better response here   You claim that you have depression and want it gone  You also state that you want whatever you might try to be rapid acting  However  your request is too broad  for me  at least  to attempt to address  and it's not clear what information will be relevant and what won't  So if you don't mind answering  here are some questions which may be useful   Are you a  mostly  healthy person  Legally an adult   How long have you been experiencing depressive symptoms   Would you characterize your depression as something you're "in "  Do you have a history of difficulties with mood  depressive or otherwise   What are the main symptoms of your current depression  Please be as detailed as you're comfortable   Are there any major stressors in your life at the moment  e g  school  work  family  relationships  social life  haunted mansions  etc     What have you tried so far to treat your symptoms   Do you have access to a psychiatrist or someone with a medical degree   Have to ever been to psychotherapy 
For video games as well  I used to love them  Now I use them as a distraction 
Fuck them for not letting you know  Also fuck them again for paying attention to something so trivial as if it makes any difference where someone sits 
I feel the same way  Whenever someone is mad at me it's all I can think about  I actually can't focus on anything else  
They know about my OCD and stuff but the drawing is embarrassing because I'm really bad at it
What do you mean update him  Also my friend is doing well    
Well mate I'm sorry for offending you but this is just the truth and my  our reality  Talking and affirmations doesn't fix this shit 
This is painfully accurate
Both are excellent  I have been taking buspar for past 3 months and generally feel less anxious and am a fan  It can make me feel a little dizzy at times but is manageable  I have been taking propranolol for large speaking engagements and or big meetings for the past 25 years  The pre speaking jitters are virtually gone  Love it and recommend to everyone I know  Good luck  
It's the way you interpret the statement  I agree it isn't just to easy to breeze over things  I've been in a very shit place over the past few years and I attempted suicide 3 weeks ago and now I'm an outpatient  But the more I'm speaking to people and realising new things  It's not meant to be a massive statement that will solve everything  It's there as just a bit of inspiration  a lot of people with depression dwell on things that cannot be changed  Yeah it isn't easy but the more I'm speaking to people in here I'm starting to realise more and more  Rather than being dicks speak to people about your problems  For the past 4 weeks I spoken to 2 people  I open a Reddit account and I've met so many people it's unreal  I've actually seen a bit of a light  Then my friend sent me that and I thought fuck it  it is a bit of inspiration and it does help  I never meant it to be condescending or make out it's easy  but see the bigger picture in life  Yeah life is shit but it's what you make of this shit hole 
I gotta save this to post on it  I'm in that exact same boat  
Films are one of my only ways to escape and feel good about myself    But on the other hand I have this fantasy life in my head where I'm an actress  I keep googling upcoming films and choose which films I'd be starring in  try to have an idea of what I'd wear on red carpet  what photoshoots I'd do  the places I'd got to visit  events and parties I'd go  all this amazing and interesting life that's never going to happen   I feel pathetic just writing this down  and makes me want to give up even trying to get a mediocre  content life 
This is exactly what I'm fearful of  I'm really poor right now and can't afford much  so if I'm going to turn out the way I came in   then no therapy for me 
The buddy system is the best way to learn to deal with anxiety   without someone dragging you along you wouldn't go   
I get very nauseous if people are yelling near me in an angry or upset way   Like my body physically can't deal with or process shouting     The first time I remember it happening was when I was playing soccer as a kid and a coach started yelling at the referee   I ran off the field because I thought I was going to vomit 
That's how I feel  that somehow real life is not for me  it's something that people around me do that I'm unable to  and that having no social life or goals like me is normal  
Because of things that happened when I was younger  Didn't tell them till a few years ago and no one believe me so we don't really talk anymore
Haha start small   r bodyweightfitness   you can start exercising 5 minutes a day on the floor   Start with hollow holds and planks  
I don't get offended  nothing anyone really says bothers me  but the fact you need to be a dick just isn't necessary  If you read I said it may change party how you feel think   People are depressed for all different reasons  so because it meant fuck all to you doesn't make that the fact for everyone  
Same here  it's like Lady of Shalott  someone on reddit actually told me about it a couple of years ago when I was describing this feeling  and in a coincidence I had a painting of it on my fb page  haven't changed it since because I resonate so much with it 
Anytime  And that sucks    I don't use my snap chat  but I do know that the pictures or whatever gets sent disappears after a little while  but is there any way at all possible to somehow retrieve them or no  
The biggest thing I did for my anxiety was learn how to control my emotions    Part of my problem was an illness that resulted in low Testosterone which had me crying for a year and a half   After figuring that out I realized its possible to control which helped me try out different things  
I have no plan  the expectation are too high for me  I just want to live my life  sometimes I just want to end it but I know if I did that someone that I know will never forgive me
I have told one friend and can't afford a therapist   At least not yet 
Yes  If you don't do it you will have to live with thinking about what might happen  That could build and build into more fantasies and dreams every time you think about her   If you ask her out and are turned down at least you can start moving on to better or different opportunities faster 
I'm really sorry  There's nothing much you can do because they're adults  You can guide them in the right direction and give suggestions  but it's up to them to follow through  But please  please don't force them to do anything  Just accept whatever they say 
That's where you're wrong  asking for and then getting help is the only way anything can change  I've sat staring at the same 4 walls for weeks then tried to commit suicide  Been on meds all that shit  but they aren't the answer because my issues are underlining I have shit view of the world and everything in  But since I've started speaking to people in Reddit and speaking to old friends  I'm learning more and more about people and they're showing me different way of looking at things    Everyone's got their own reason for depression  because ours isn't the same doesn't mean it doesn't help someone else 
Oh my god  this happens to me also  I don't have a solution per se  but I just wanted to say that you are not alone  Something that somewhat helps for me is channeling my emotions into an activity  Personally  I pick up a guitar and start to play chords and just mess around  as I find it helps to put my mind on something else  I'm  far  from good  but just playing puts me in a better mindset  as I feel I have control over something for a moment  
Anything else I should look for   Fine print stuff  company to use  etc  
On thank god this happens to someone else  I thought I was crazy  
I take Lexapro for anxiety and depression  I love this medication  but I do also have to deal with sexual side effects which are annoying  I also had to go through two other medications before I was prescribed Lexapro  Anti depressants work  but also need to be prescribed alongside taking therapy  The medication helps your mind  while the therapy helps you deal with whatever triggers the depression anxiety 
Bullshit you got butthurt because I didn't agree with you and go "YEAHH THIS HELPED ME" lurk more 
I also support this 100   It took me years and years of going to see my psychiatrist  but I am finally learning how to cope with my own abuse  It never hurts to talk to someone  
It has been over a year now  I am not sure I would get back together with him unless he felt he was ready to be in a relationship  I would consider it but only if we had a long talk about what that means and if we could reach a mutual decision that works both of us  I do know that I will always love him though  He is an extraordinary man but he does not see what I see though   
I have a similar problem  thinking no one really gives a damn  I do a couple of things  first of all I remind myself that people don't really hang out with others unless they want to and second that I maybe asking too much of people   People will only do so much  i wish it were different but that's what I found 
Have you seen a dr  A hormonal imbalance  vitamin deficiency  family history can all cause depression without an obvious reason  
  Repeating things to myself does not help   It does help   You don't have an inner core   all of the thoughts are under your control   The problem is figuring out how to do it and sticking with it   It took me a year of smiling at myself in the mirror and saying I love you to see positive changes   For example one problem I had was seeing a knife and imagining myself killing people around me   It was exactly like a fear of heights to me   I was afraid it would just happen like falling does   After the 'I love you's to myself these just melted away   I stopped being scared by the thoughts and they stopped occurring  
Deleted mine in 2011 never used it much and never had many "friends" on it had it out of sheep mentality  you did the right thing 
Yes I have it often when I am anxious  It is really my first indicator  
It sucks but it does help  it enables me to enter a sort of "I don't give a fuck" mode that provides a well needed relief  Often when I drink I think to myself "this is how 'normal' people usually are  huh  pretty neat"
Wow fuck me  keep going mate  This is rather funny  you don't know me  I honestly don't give a shit what anyone says I don't know you and your opinion is invalid  You're the one that's come here to vent your anger  pretty sure it's you that's 'butthurt'  I've haven't interacted on the internet for that long I forgot keyboard warriors like you still existed  Haha wow have a nice pal  
I'm glad your friend is doing well    Consider telling your psychiatrist exactly what you wrote in your original post  You expressed yourself very well and provided important information that can help him help you 
Don't know whether or not its normal  but I experience the same sort of automatic response when someone shows interest in me sexually  was sexually abused growing up for years   Through talk therapy and dbt and cbt therapies  this happens less often  And when it does happen  I can sometimes work through it  Its not full proof  but is much easier and im headed in a good direction  I would recommend those therapies  could help you as well  I wish you luck 
I honestly feel the exact same way  The med dosage I take helps with the pain and anxiety  but the loneliness and self loathing are ever present 
Yep  I use them more of a crutch than enjoyment  I got new games for Christmas but I can't even motivate myself to play them  Sad   
Clickbait  Cute though  
I have learned this myself  Keep the suicide comments to a minimum so they don't take overt actions   It's about biding time  keeping every ball bouncing the same until things are in more control 
Absolutely

Hi friend  I am incredibly sorry with hearing your story  That's heart breaking especially for your son to have gone through such a tramatic event  And to be pushed away by your family is sickening   I want to say  as a veteran  I think having both versions of PTSD together is healthy  I say this mainly not to overshadow your experience  but I think mental health in the health system lacks big time for sufferers like yourself  My wife experienced accute PTSD after seeing a man die  whom I tried to save from a heart attack   He subsequently died of his illness but she has had major anxiety since   I think your PTSD is something much more severe and in need of special care then myself as someone who seen people killed  You deserve the best care and support    Thank you for sharing your story and I think all of us who suffer drama should stand for better care across the board 
I agree with your logic
shouldve deleted mine sooner aye    
 removed 
agree 100 
Try  listening to guided meditation  they have some specifically for falling asleep 
Ideas      Earplugs  I have some earplugs that I got at a grocery store that are less noise canceling than others  It kinda just turns the volume down  I can still hear but it's not as loud  I wear them to sleep  still hear my alarm  or to the gym for fitness classes with loud music      Solo movie dates  It's hard to know how to manage situations when you have the added social pressure of being around other people  Maybe if there's a  1 theater in your area  you could try out going to a movie on your own   I actually really like doing this   
yup memes are everywhere lmao  its only been a day since i deleted fb and it already feels like a huge weight was lifted of my shoulders  
I just bought Doom and some cases in Rocket League and CS GO  just to blow all my money away  I thought they would produce some happiness  but all it gave was nothing  I quit Doom the moment I bought it  and I quit Rocket League after the first couple games  It is sad   
Maybe large headphones so people don't talk to you would be an easier idea  I think the sweatshirt tent may attract more attention than hide you  With headphones it you would blend in more and people would just assume you are trying to enjoy your tunes and leave you alone 
No I haven't seen one  Im planning but I'm scared for my career   Im turning 25 in a few days and I haven't accomplished that much in my life  The career that I have right now is the only thing that I have by default
happy new years
i aint that desperate yet     lol
I can't help but tune into the yelling  It's all I've known for a long time  I'm happy my parents are older and more docile now  we feel more like a family  hopefully that's all the therapy I need 
I actually brought my headphones with me and had music playing on my phone for emergencies  And I was alone    thank you for the suggestions 
I experience this as feeling like the person I'm speaking to  and it's usually when I'm talking to someone else  starts to shrink or feel further and further away  
Quality contribution  thanks
Funnily enough  Kingdom Hearts was the game I was talking about lol  And I am currently on season 2 of the Flash  
I've been taking Zoloft for nearly 10 months   Haven't really noticed much other than I've grown more apathetic and 'lazy' than I have been in the past   
I LOVE seltzer water with frozen berries  It takes a while to get used to the lack of sugar if you're really addicted to it  I also do low carb so it's not an issue for me  but it's actually so refreshing and completely curbs my craving for a soda  
But was the Chinese food good  Now I want some  I think I have the fixings for fried rice now that I think of it  Maybe later this week I will go get some Mongolian beef 
Or are these so called "microsaccades" 
I'm so proud of you  good job  That's honestly such a hard thing to do  I hope you feel better soon 
also same 
If I ever have to talk to a doctor teacher or friend I never say I'm depressed  I just say I want to die or I just hate living 
YAYS    That's great  Where did you go to  Did you enjoy yourself   I don't always enjoy myself when I go out but getting there and am able to do so now more and more  it's awesome     
I don't see anything you did as wrong in the least bit  and I definitely do not think you are a bad person because of this at all   What you are describing does not strike me as bad in the least bit   Try your best not to ruminate  believe me I know how difficult it can be   We can both do this   
it worked for me
This happens to me when I'm extremely anxious
People can't be that stupid to think that when you're on the verge of bawling your eyes out  you're in a fury of rage  In other words  they're poking fun at you  insisting you're angry  are they you  How do they know what you feel    invalidating you and your experiences  provoking you  and they're not the kind of people who want to talk  with  you   There's an acronym for this  JADE  Justify  Argue  Defend  Explain  Don't do it  Don't JADE yourself to with people like this  Instead  greyrock them and talk through this with someone who actually cares    When talking to someone who actually cares  just be honest  They'd be smart enough to understand 
This absolutely makes sense to me  and I felt the same way all day night yesterday  I never remember feeling this way before when I was younger and would spend New Years with my parents and little brother  but now that I'm older and of drinking age I feel like there's so much pressure to be out with friends and drinking and having fun    but that's just not me  I'm thankful my boyfriend is the same way    It kinda reminds me of the How I Met Your Mother episode about New Years and how overrated and exhausting it is trying to have the  best New Years ever  and it just ends up being a huge  exhaustive failure    Don't worry about what other people are doing and posting  you are not them and you shouldn't compare yourself to others    remember  everything looks perfect from the outside looking in  but that is rarely ever the case  
If you do have someone  please talk to them about your problems  If you do and it seems like they aren't trying to help  they may just be struggling to understand you  I know years ago when I was dating who I thought of as my "true love"  she would often go into a quiet and depressive state without warning  She was definitely also bipolar  from what I had observed  and had issues with anger  I tried so desperately to understand her and help  and she made me feel like I did nothing somehow  She would shrug me off and say nothing was wrong  I wanted to badly to help  but she pushed me away  probably because I was struggling with terrible anxiety and she was afraid of what might happen to us in the future  We've been separated for at least 3 or 4 years  and I have yet to feel as passionately about anyone as I did for her for many long years  If someone really cares they should always do what they can to help  but it's up to you to reconcile and tell them how they can do so   Sorry if this is useless  I try to be helpful but often feel slightly  if not completely  useless  If none of that struck any importance  please at least still know that there are people in this world who will absolutely and genuinely care about you  and that there are people here on this sub reddit who will always be open to talk   Hopefully things get better for all of us some day 
All the time    
Yeah  you summed it up perfectly  I avoid parties because I just  can't  enjoy myself  When I do try and socialize  it is just so forced and awkward and I cringe when I look back at the times when I wanted to appear like an extrovert  I'm sad when I look at pictures of a party that I missed  but I also get disheartened when I'm at a party in which I feel out of place  It's a vicious cycle  
Honestly I try really hard not to think about it  I did some crazy and fucked up things while manic that I'm still ashamed of  I hope that someday I can forgive myself but I'm not there yet    The only thing to do is move forward and do whatever I can to keep it from happening again 
Tell us more   
Wow what a bunch of dickheads 
This happens to me too  I was also sexually abused early in life and was raped repeatedly by my first long term boyfriend  which I thought was normal because my mom told me that it was all I was good for  That relationship ended about 4 years ago and yep I still feel this  I'm in therapy and it has really helped  but on bad days I still catch myself thinking these things    It's not just you and therapy helps  As long as you have a good therapist  of course 
No   
Thanks  I think the holiday season and not having much to do has exacerbated the frequency of my panic attacks  I'm going to look into new hobbies though  similar to how you keep yourself busy with competitive gaming    Regarding other people    I just don't get it when everyone is so calm about death  It makes me want to violently shake them out of it    Sometimes at night I lie under the covers and try to imagine what death feels while being absolutely still  It's terrifying but I can't stop this form of self inflicted torture     draws back to my morbid curiosity of death  while still being paralysed by the fear of it  
What are you interested in  
I enjoy The Mindy Project  because all of her relationships fail BUT she is always okay  It set much more realistic expectation for myself  Also it's hilarious  Someone else mentioned Workaholics  also a good one  As someone with social anxiety like a mother fucker I can't stand the movies with the "awkward" cute girls having someone fall madly in love with them because I'm awkward as shit and that is not an accurate portrayal of how it pans out   At least in my life  
You're not required to love family    Perhaps you could use a new start  Maybe move away and develop new relationships  That's what I'm going to do  
yes  yes  yes it gets better   when it is becoming too much  that is exactly when you have to deal with it   if the idea of directly addressing your memories is overwhelming to you  there are therapy options that focus on building coping skills without having to verbally re live your specific traumas   i thought that my world would be full of triggers forever  but it is not   time help heals   the fact that you are aware of patterns in your mood and options for addressing them means you have made substantial progress already toward recovery   don't turn back  it gets brighter just around the bend   godspeed to you  happy new year 
It's actually one of the main causes of depression  one of the best things i've ever done in my life was to delete my Instagram account exactly a year ago  
It's capitalism and how greedy people from a Western culture are I guess  We buy countless stuff to feel happy but it doesn't last long at all  Maybe I'm just a miserable bastard but that's how I view it  Even if I had a girlfriend I don't think it would change anything  All I really want to do is sleep  Like forever 
Thanks for your reply  I wrote the post last night during one of my attacks and was really comforted this morning to read the responses  I hope that one day I'll magically grow to accept it  but the more I love life  the more terrified I am of losing it    A couple months ago while overseas I visited a graveyard in a historical site and it really hit me hard  Seeing those tombstones dated hundreds of years ago  people buried in family plots  neglected graves  It just made me feel really empty    It wouldn't be so bad if we knew for sure that there was something after life  I'm just scared that my whole life means nothing in the grand scheme of things    I'm jealous that life will carry on without me  and that I'll miss out on amazing new inventions and experiences  
definitely consider getting back on meds and seeing a therapist   totally worth it   its like asking if it's worth using crutches while you have a broken leg  or asking if its worth it to have insulin as a diabetic    part of PTSD can be paranoia of others and fear of being vulnerable   this is especially true if someone has taken advantage of you   part of the healing process is being able to open up to healthy people and build new trust and connections   one of the best ways to prevent PTSD is to give people community and support after trauma   it also has the potential to rebuild your confidence and mental health moving forward 
Not much  I play the guitar a little bit but I suck at it  and I don't think that'll change soon 
100  can relate  I was once fired for crying uncontrollably after a jerkhole boss berated me for asking for help on a task at work I was being trained on  I try to accept as part of me and work with it  Don't shut down  at least for me  that can worsen the panic attacks  Ask for help  and if the first person you ask doesn't help you keep at it  I also try engaging all my five senses and reminding myself I'm safe   You are not alone  you are not damaged goods  you have many good qualities and your illness does not define you  You are worthy and you are loved 
That's certainly understandable  It is unfortunate that in some careers people are unable to seek help for fear of losing their job    You could speak with a GP about some of your physical symptoms  Some drugs used to treat depression are also used for other things like weight loss  smoking cessation etc  I was struggling with depression and have severe vitamin D deficiency  Whenever it gets low  I'm unable to function and go into a spiral  Maybe getting a health check could help    Is there something specific driving your feelings  
I HATE that this happens Just got accused of invalidating others' feelings by talking about my depression Really sliding into a bad place and I'm scared  could have used some help  instead I got that shit  I HATE that people don't even try to understand  ask question or at least educate themselves  before they pass judgments   You can't blame them for some things  but for ending friendships due to it  hell yeah you can blame 
What medication are you taking    
Thank you very much for your response  it is very helpful and sounds about right  But unfortunately  whilst she had a therapist counsellor in the past  she felt uncomfortable talking about this incident  and as such  didn't discuss what happened at all  I have advised her a few times to try speaking to someone  even just her doctor  when she feels able to  not being pushy or too frequent  just suggesting it here and there  even before she told me about this incident   but she continues to feel uncomfortable doing so   Of course I don't know exactly what goes on in her mind  but she's generally quite a quiet person  and tends to internalise or ignore a lot of her feelings instead of dealing with them in a more active manner  She also recently applied for a job in the military and is afraid that being diagnosed with depression or PTSD means she will be exempt from this career path 
Sides i cant love friends eitehr all they ever do is cross me  
I've been on Effexor I think  I have a friend on Vyvanse now  Isn't it an amphetamine  I have heart problems so I don't think I'd be able to take it  Plus I don't want something that will give me terrible withdrawals if I stop taking it  I'll research the other two  Thanks    
I always thought 'if I get depressed  I'll always keep running and it'll keep me from the lowest lows'  Turns out clinical depression's a little different from that in that you don't want to  have zero interest in  physically  can't  run  even if you used to be a marathoner  So yeah  I relate to this  I've tried to get myself out there but it's 100000000000 times harder  even though I'm not out of shape  and I end up quitting 
Well  there's only one way to find out  which is to get that blood test  And if you do indeed have diabetes  you'll be much better off if you get on a treatment plan rather than remaining undiagnosed  I know it sucks and is nerve wracking  but plenty of people have diabetes and live a perfectly normal life  Also maybe you'll get lucky and it is just your anxiety after all  
I appreciate your response  and as much as I like to be open minded about different techniques  I fail to grasp this particular method  feel skeptical of it for myself  and am unsure about how to use it successfully  I also found the linked content unhelpful  Any advice 
CT   Thank you so much for this thoughtful  sincere response  It's especially helpful to hear it from a therapist  and especially given the kind of work that you do with trauma survivors  My current therapist also is very well versed in trauma  and has done speeches on his hypnosis work with trauma survivors  and it has always been reassuring to see his depth of knowledge and sensitivity within that discourse  for my care's sake  Is it possible for me to stay in touch with you some how in case I have similar questions or have these spontaneous self doubt melt downs  My therapist is on vacation for the holidays        Thanks again 
Sertraline 100mg
When you are depressed  Your brain functions differently  Different chemical reactions going on in your head  You aren't doing anything on purpose  The symptoms are there  That's like saying you are adding on to your cold by sneezing too much  Try taking vitamin D and getting a gym member ship  Get on a routine and then find a social activity  Like volunteering or some school program  Getting on a strike food and workout routine is crucial to getting over it  You are sick and there is a cure  It's hard and I too suffer from it  I went into the hospital last month because i wasn't eating  Your body will fix itself  
There is no sucking at guitar if you enjoy doing it  cheesy as that sounds 
Visited Grandma and went to a new park by her place  It was a nice outing 
I'll speak from my experience  I was depressed and rather numb as well when I sought help  Therapy helped  significantly  although my therapist eventually determined he could not do any more for me and referred me to a psychiatrist  Therapy did not change my subconscious  it helped me manage my thoughts and develop behavioral strategies  My therapist and I talked in detail about irrational thoughts  why I have them  and how to challenge them  I think it's also important that therapy didn't end with the office visits  it was something I had and have to apply daily  It can be a lot of work sometimes    On the relationship front  my therapist helped me to keep perspective on what my family was observing in me  I resented their comments and reactions a lot less  and this helped me not to give spiteful responses  It also helped me work through my resentment towards friends for daring to ask me to go out and do something  I am calmer in knowing it's okay to say no sometimes and I can think more rationally about accepting invitations and pushing myself  I stuck with the therapist I initially saw  so I can't really help on finding the right one  I just liked him and his manner    Therapy is expensive  I can't deny that  I'm in the US with high deductible health insurance  using a health savings account helps  How I viewed it was I was paying for more than just the hour  but all the time I was using what I'd learned    Good luck  you can figure this out 
Well  there are some really common symptoms of depression to check for  For example  have you been sleeping okay  have you had changes in appetite  do you find it more difficult than usual to get out of bed  do you feel 'slowed down' or get aches and pains'  do you feel worse about yourself than usual  do you feel hopeless  or as if nothing will get better  is your focus concentration poorer than usual   If you have a number of these symptoms  it is likely you are experiencing depression  but I cannot diagnose you of course  and whether it is situational or endogenous we cannot tell you either
Hey  just wanted to say  I've read your words  And I'm sorry for your loss    I'm not one for long complex comments  But what you said about that ride  If it's one thing I've learnt in the past 5 years of depression is if they're important to you and they care about you  don't beat yourself up over what you said when you're feeling depressed  if they care they'll understand and they'll stay  Hell I've called friends the worst names under the sun  the ones  a small few  who care stay
It's okay if you don't feel like it  no need to force yourself to do anything  But believe me  you need some fun in your life  It will not make any problem disappear  but it'll make them easier to bear 
Hmm i take 50mg and ive missed doses before  didnt notice any side effects tho   But maybe wait for more responses as your dose is higher than mine    Cant you call ur doc  
You're going through a tough time right now  Being sad is normal  you shouldn't shy away from it  Sadness will handicap your daily life without any doubts  It will affect everything from your career to your eating habits  It is how you cope with it that will tell you if you are depressed or not  It may take years for you to find true happiness again but it will come eventually  Whether it comes internally or externally at some point you will find some sort of happiness  It doesn't necessarily get easier or better with time but you eventually fond ways to go around sadness to seek happiness  And it is those brief happiness moments that will make up for all the time you've been sad  
I don't even know  first of all I would like to thank you for the time u took to respond back to me  I feel the feeling that I have stems from the fact that I haven't found what is my call in life  It is so frustrating since I'm getting older and time is not on my side  Not only that I also think that I'm asexual  no sex drive at all  
There really is tho  It's rough playing the same thing 300 times and realizing the one thing you actually care about is something you're so bad at  Something that you just can't train your fingers to do  How pathetic is that 
Thank you for your comment  The service I accessed in the past was just intended for use up to 12 months after an incident  and whilst I have been trying to access therapy for various reasons through the NHS for over the last year  it still seems elusive  hidden behind constant waiting lists and referrals  And unfortunately I don't have the money to afford a private therapist for now  This particular aspect of my situation is killing me   I really appreciate and agree with what you are saying though  particularly that whilst I am like this  it is hard to create a safe  strong  supporting environment for us both  That said  I feel that when she has issues she wishes to discuss with me  my head seems to clear suddenly and everything else fades away  like I go into protective mode and my tunnel vision towards helping her swings into action  Therefore  I think I have a fairly good success rate for helping her when she is upset and needs help  it's just everything around these occasions that is worse right now    Thank you very much

At some point you have to just embrace the nervousness and do it anyway  I've literally vomitted having to go somewhere new but the more you force yourself the easier it gets    If you are truly seriously deeply unable to do this  not just uncomfortable  not just a horrible terrible feeling  but would lay down and die if someone had a gun to your head      then you need to get medical help  It's okay if that's the case  you don't have to be ashamed    But you need to do one or the other    start forcing yourself through babysteps or get medical help  Either way it'll start to get better  Feel for ya  pal  
Maybe acceptance is the step to a better fortune 
Well  I'm thinking of cutting my thighs again  opposed to killing myself  Nothing is really bothering me but my illness  also insomnia  Took a Trazadone and am waiting for that to work  Overall  I'm feeling empty 
You have to be really careful with edibles  I've had great success with them  but have also wrecked myself  It was actually a huge contributing factor to my POCD breakdown  I would imagine it is largely strain dependent  I CAN'T do sativas  The deep thinking makes my OCD go out of control and that was with a hybrid  I don't want to know what a full sativa would do  I've had pretty good luck with indicas although once I was in an OCD breakdown they made it worse as well   All that to say  be really careful with any drugs if you have OCD

I haven't had any side effects with lamictal  but it's always a possibility
that is a good point I think I am just desperate at this point that I am willing to do anything to engage in basic human interactions I do wanna be accepted by people but people usually don't want to associate with the real me 
Very well said  
Maybe this is the wrong direction to take this but if you want support for this particularly   You might want to check anti natalism subs for more logical and less negative reason to have your own   It has actually made me want to adopt someday rather than continue the overpopulation 
I've heard Cymbalta  Duloxetine  is helpful at higher doses  I think what we're seeing here is there are many options that may work best for you  Try not to get frustrated and keep working toward better days 
I hope you're in a better place   I'm struggling too right now and while it hurts to think of others sad lonely depressed it helps me to know I'm not alone  
Sorry to hear that   Are there any adults at school that you are comfortable talking to about some of this  
Make sure you get tested frequently  stay safe buddy    
I took it for a while when it first came out and I hated it  After about a month of taking it I would start having a ridiculously fast heartbeat whenever I took it  It felt like my heart was literally going to burst and I got cold sweats  I went to the doctor because of the symptoms and they told me I needed to get off it right away because my blood pressure and pulse were through the roof  So yeah  I don't take that anymore  
Type 2 diabetes can be effectively eliminated reversed at your age just by losing the weight and eating appropriately  It's not too late to change your life  regardless of how your results come back 
Second this but without the friend zoned part  add fearing never meeting someone to connect to     
Dude if someone said that to me I'd be blown away   I might want to date them just for being real   What do you like to watch on YouTube   It's as legitimate as Netflix and you can learn from it    and never really "finish" your binge
I have heard that it is extremely difficult to get a job at Costco outside of hiring events when they open new stores   Even then they are very selective about who they hire   People seem to stay at Costco forever   There are multiple people who have worked at the Costco near me since the store opened    in 1989   Others have been there 5  10 or 15 years   That is unheard of in retail in my view 
You're very welcome   You can reach me here  in PM if you want   I typically check in at least daily  though it may be every other day when things are busy for me   If you don't hear back from me quickly  it's not that I'm ignoring you  I'm just not on 
Sorry you don't feel like you have anyone to talk to   Feel free to message me if you would like someone to talk to  I would be happy to help   
You my be able to access services through the RAINN website if you live in the states  They have a 1 800 number  a online forum and can refer you to a trauma therapist in your community whose services are free   I hope that you and your gf find the support that you both need 
They are jerks  I've noticed that most the time time when anxiety is triggered it because people are being jerks  I just ignore them
I use my laptop and Xbox as an escape from it  My parents try to persuade me to take up more social activities but I'm just not the social type of person
In germany  the psychiatrist can only send you to a closed ward if you are in acute danger to yourself or others  So if you dont have any  plans as to how when you want to kill yourself  she cant send you anywhere  So my advice would be that you tell her  you go to her because you want  and need  help but she couldnt really help you nearly as well if you hold back   I took medication for a while but the problem for me was that you have to take most of them for at least a month before they really show anything and usually in that first month it gets worse before it gets better  And then you dont have a guarantee that this medication will work so you may well try four or five different types  thats more than half a year in which I was more miserable than before so at some point I told myself I can do it without medication    Before my first appointment  I was nervous as hell  wondering what I would tell him and how I would go about it  Turned out that all wasnt necessary since its most of the time the psychiatrist thats leading the conversation  he she is asking questions and you just tell the truth  or if you dont want  tell that you arent comfortable talking about it  she has to accept that and maybe come back to it in a later session 
Why should we distract ourSelves  It's an escape not a cure like you said  It's fine if you want the temporary distraction but I don't 
Social media is poison if you are depressed   I deleted my Insta account  I have reduced my Facebook time to almost zero  keeping it because of a hobby I have that connects through FB  And I have a LinkedIn account  Nothing else   Stay away from as much social media AS possible  
Fuck those people  OP  If they'll yell at a new person for breaking an unwritten and uncommunicated rule  they aren't worth the effort 
Even if I want to go somewhere I can't  I can't drive  and I'm stuck babysitting most days 
Please make sure you DO NOT turn to drugs to deal with this    It gets better  I promise  Don't let meth ruin your life like it has mine    Good luck my friend    Love u and happy new year
Green tea definitely has caffeine  but much less than regular coffee   The  abbreviated  hierarchy of most to least caffeine is  coffee  black tea  green tea  decaf coffee 
I thought the point of living with your parents was that you don't pay rent   Maybe you should move out and get a roommate     One of my lesser hobbies is finding good deals   Check out fatwallet com or slickdeals net   Some people make a living finding deals and flipping it on ebay   When I was poor  I was able to live on  50 a month for food   I used to take the bus and walk to the grocery store because I couldn't afford a car   I was able to pay my 35k student loan in 2 years living frugal 
Sorry to hear it is a problem   It sounds like he is very supportive of you which is great to hear and want you want in a significant other   You explain you have this uncomfortability with yourself  but have you communicated this to him   Have you told him you think he is "wonderfully supportive" and ask him that you need his support   May I suggest something active when these waves hit  going fora walk together can help with the endorphins 
Hey  for a moment i tought you were my gf  cause i know thats how she exactly feels about my anxiety relationship    Just be there for him  dont try to do anything  Everytime i get panic attacks and my gf starts asking are u okay u want some water u want to go outside or starts holding my hand  it just makes it worse for me    The reason for this is because it makes me more nervous and anxious  While im trying to fight my racing thoughts and convincing my brain that nothing is happening  i just really need silence    I sometimes feel like a dick because i always throw her off and she gets mad and then i feel like shit  but deep down i know shes just trying to help me cause she worries about me    I already talked to her and told her that i really appreciate her help but the best thing she can do for me while me having anxiety attack is to just be there and pretend nothing is happening  dont stare at me like im having a stroke  if ineed help or feel that its getting out of hand ill tell her  
I suppose I have something on the flipside  so to speak   I have PTSD in part from severe emotional abuse from three different exes  in the same manner   It makes me basically incapable of feeling loved or wanted or attractive  Likewise  whenever I see or interact with a girl I find attractive  I get an awful  sick feeling in my stomach   I dunno   it's just like I feel so repulsive because of how callously I've been treated in the last 
Hey u nekroid  I feel you  Depression on its own sucks without having to deal with anxiety bipolarity and BPD  although I lean further toward MPD DID   so I can relate to you a bit    I'm writing this at 4am my time  because I spent the last two hours trying to pick myself out of the rut of depression in order to try to sleep   Suicidal thoughts suck  but for every one that drags us down it's a symbol of determination that we persist each day    I know it sounds like I'm being perky and cheery  I just have a habit of coming across like that when I type  either that or pissed off     Turn to your boyfriend for the good and if you feel like it's a bad day  you are welcome come talk  One or both of me will be around   Might I recommend Mr  Suicide Sheep on YouTube  He's got a lot of good music for depression  it's mostly chilled out stuff
I'm terminally single and it's never really bothered me until recently  So many people I know recently got engaged or are getting engaged soon and my friends are all coupled up  which means I'm left out a lot when they go do couple things     It's very hard and people are suddenly treating me like there's something wrong with me since I'm 27F and     STILL SINGLE OHNOEZ SO CLOSE TO 30  and contrary to popular belief  not every 20something female has the easiest time finding someone to date   I'm very introverted and don't connect to a lot of people which makes it hard finding someone I actually want to date  
I'm sorry  but I just don't get it  What exactly do you want  Are you satisfied with your current lifestyle  If so  why are you posting in  r depression  I might not have all the answers  but I want to help 
I totally feel you  8 minutes into 2017 and I already get left on read  My text was even a simple  inconsequential question that could have quickly been answered with a "yes" or a "no"  They just didn't bother to answer  for some reason  I can't help but feel that it means something more even though it most likely doesn't  Anyway  my point is  you're not alone and this situation definitely sucks  
When I was about your age I was thinking the same thing     I had my first kiss at 21   I went on my first date when I was 27   Every date I've had since then has been increasingly easier     I've still yet to have a relationship but I know it's going to happen   I just keep trying   My brother once told me it's just a numbers game     I understand the comfort of acceptance  but I don't recommend it 
If you really want to pursue improving yourself in guitar  the most you can do is practice and thinking about mistakes is good for learning but don't go overboard  I can't stress enough how important it is to be passionate about something though  
I have not attempted a GED  but I know of some people that have  They all passed and from what I remember them saying  it wasn't too bad   On the topic of your mom  that sounds like a tough situation  One thing I have had to grasp about my own family is that everyone is doing the best they can within their own frame of mind   It sounds like your mom is HUGE on maintaining appearances  Probably because she was raised in the same way from her own family so she doesn't really know any other way to live  Society also preaches about maintaining appearances too   On the other hand  you have suffered a lot over the years and you know that maintaining appearances is not important to you  You need to figure out what is though   For me  I like making people laugh  I have connected with a smallish sized online community on twitter with other like minded people that like to do comedy  I'm in chat rooms with them and feel welcome in most of em  They help me to feel connected   You need to learn more about who you are and what you like  Also  don't be afraid to push through some of the fear  Like taking baby steps outside to help push against the agoraphobia   Keep reading about the condition online and learn from those that have succeeded in achieving independent living with agoraphobia   Take all my advice with a grain of salt  Also  talk to a school counselor too at your local community college  The are pretty cheap and help others even if you don't go to school there 
When someone tells you to knock off the pity party  I want you to smash that person in the face as hard as you can 
Mine took about a month to work  first two weeks were hell and made me feel horrible  Just don't ever skip a dose  Zoloft withdrawals are the worst thing ever 
This would be my choice of life if I didn't feel empty and thinking about the fun I used to have  I think people need friends
It's so hard  Honestly I would say try to meet just one friend  from a club or something  The first friend is the hardest  After that  you can often hang out with that person's friends and it can have a trickle effect  
Absolutely   And regardless of the outcome take pride in yourself for having the courage to do it and the maturity to accept the answer if you're rejected   Much better to be straightforward than to covertly try to be her friend and months later spring it on her that you never wanted to just be her friend to begin with     Or better yet  go ask out a bunch of random girls first   You'll likely get turned down a lot   But you'll get some practice in and will learn to deal with rejection   So when it comes time to ask out a girl you really do like you'll be more confident   And nothing is more attractive than confidence 
This does sound like depression  It goes hand and hand with anxiety for many people  I'm usually hit hardest with anxiety but depression comes and goes for me  I would suggest trying a counselor  Sometimes just having a firm diagnosis and knowing what to call what is going on and having a term for it is helpful  Take it day by day 
I deleted mine in 2015 and wanted to know who were my friends and acquaintances out of 250  people    The answer is None  
I feel this  I don't enjoy waking up and look forward to the day anymore and haven't for over a year  I used to love playing video games and cleaning my room  but now all I do basically is sit down and do nothing but be bored on the internet  I have no motivation and no energy to do anything I love anymore  It's all hard and feels like a waste of time  Crying is more of a comfort to me now because sitting around feeling sick of myself is worse  My boyfriend just tells me to "stop feeling sad" and "get over it" and "you're holding yourself back" but I am frustrated that he doesn't understand that it's not that easy  I'm not lazy  and it doesn't help at all when he says crap like that  My doctor doesn't help me get the medications I need  and gave me ones that only made me worse with each change  My mom  dad  and brother don't act the same around me whenever I do go out of my boring  lonely apartment like they used to   But I'm glad to see this because it makes me feel less alone  I hope this is a comfort 
Wow I never even thought of New Years texts  I got a Facebook message from my mom and that's it  
Okay  Once you can afford it  how do you feel about trying it 
It helps to know that you are not the only one
the only reason I haven't deleted Facebook yet is for the memes like there's so many good meme pages that help me feel better when I'm sad  also My Spotify is connected through it so    but boy would I be better off without it  Comparing urself to others is so bad but I do it all the time 
 removed 
yea that's true  for me a comparison would be like hugging family vs hugging a partner  light and day difference  but hugging family and friends still feels pretty good though 
You need to do this with a plan from your doctor   If you were feeling worse with the medication  they could try another   I'm tapering off 20mg of lexapro right now as well  I didn't like the lethargy and other side effects  and my dr made a plan of 20mg every day and 10mg every third day  for a month   Next month  20 mg one day 10 mg the next  for a month   Then 10 mg every day for a month   You can't just make up your own program that lasts three days or you'll have these withdrawal effects  
You are welcome    Yes I work with people to help them overcome social anxiety 
Yes  Facebook is a pox  Zuckerberg invented a brand new way for people to be offended  The dreaded Unfriending      The Horror       Fuck that whole clusterfuck of a social spiderweb 
Yeah  that kicking in part of the meds and trying different ones sucks  If I get any worse than I am right now  she might as well lock my ass up and lobotomize me    Do you know how when I get my diagnosis papers   I'm kinda treating that as a diploma of sorts  a diploma of how fucked I am lol
I can relate   just this afternoon I'm walking on the beach with my dog  having ridden my bike there  and I feel depressed  I thought "someone else could have my life and they might be happy " well  that may be true  but such a thought makes me feel worse  it makes me feel ashamed  that I should somehow magically feel better  because someone else in my shoes might feel different  i feel as i do  and feeling depressed when i might normally feel happy is a symptom of depression  heck  i've been depressed at disneyland  the alleged happiest place on earth  among the hardest things about depression for me is to not completely identify with it  it can feel all consuming  like "I am depression "  lately i feel like there is a biochemical component to my depression  because mornings are hell  afternoons are hell lite  and then late afternoons and eves i can feel at ease and happy  but then the next morning it starts all over  god  its wearing though      
I agree  That's why I'm apart of the YMCA and lift shoot hoops almost daily  The problem is I can't just go random ass places by myself  That's how I end up on the news dead  
I wasn't saying that you did expect them to magically disappear  I was simply saying that that is going to happen just because 1 day turns in to another  and that these things take work    I understand the symbolism of the new year  and I'm sure you won't be alone in your thinking  But you still have 363 days left in 2017 to make progress    I actually only found I got use from counselling for the day I had the counselling  there are 7 days in a week and I was only feeling better for 1 of them  Also in the end we ended up just going round in circles  Have you heard of considered CBT DBT   I know a lot of people who learn some great chomping methods through that

Man this makes me cry because I feel the exact same way  I couldn't do that to my parents  but damn do I just want to go  24 7 Im so on edge that I could drop something and start crying  My mom was so happy about the "New Year" too telling me things would get better its a new start when she kept going I just wanted to cry my eyes out  Its just another year of misery
Yay  That's fantastic  You should be proud  the stuff that feels impossible can be so worthwhile 
Bout as pathetic as playing the same shit over and over again for a decade  Admiral is right  you gotta start somewhere  I'm not talented and one depressed S O B but fuck  you play that shit for a while you get a little better  Then you move to a new song you bore yourself to tears over it    Shit when I started I could barely play smoke on the fucking water  but bit by bit I improved  Hated myself for forcing myself to play  still do  but it's something I care about  So be that dumbass dipshit and play it again  because 2016 sucked  2017 may not even notice us leave   And when you're cursing over that song for the 1000th time call me that idiot loser who told you to play   Fuck it  we might even make a friend or two who likes guitar   Maybe then killing oneself might not seem like such a calling  because you  like me can play guitar and you'll be good at something   All cursing and swearing aside  I'm cool with teaching you a bit of guitar  bout the only thing I'm vaguely good at  2  5  7   2  5  9  6    Shit fucked it up again  smoke on the water  
Hope you had a good new year also  I find that being lazy relaxes me  and I don't see it as a bad thing if it happens every once in a while  I use the time to recharge and relax  get away from my troubles and distract myself  For me  I know I'm feeling down when my feelings from my past arise  or if any issues from the present start to affect me more than usual   Does that makes sense   Basically  everything comes at me at once  and I get sadder than usual  and being by myself does me no good  During this time  I go seek out company  Even if I don't tell them what's going on  it helps to be around others and be distracted   When I'm okay  I can laugh and enjoy things normally  Reading and watching TV can easily distract me  and my sadness is kept at bay  That doesn't mean things aren't wrong  I still have underlying issues that I need to work through  and those feelings can come up at anytime  I try to keep busy to distract myself from those feelings until I work through them  Does that help 
You should ask your doctor whether they would like to consider switching to other medications in the same class as abilify aripiprazole    a common one used to augment wellbutrin in depression would be seroquel quetiapine 
I hope that is not the case  I was recently in a similar situation  But  on the bright side  a shelter may be able to refer you to resources to help with mental health  You ARE going to be ok  Hang in there 
I used to be fine with angry people  but now I'm customer service damaged and either panic or completely shut down  I don't understand why adults think that throwing tantrums is acceptable 
After consultation with maternal fetal medicine before even getting pregnant  I made the choice to stay on my meds  including lithium  The doctor said he's had many patients stay on it and in his career he hasn't seen an issue  I had to have a fetal echocardiogram to make sure the heart was developing properly  and the fetal cardiologist told me the same thing  she's never seen an issue with lithium exposure in her career  It's rare but there is a reported risk  I now have a 100  happy  well not right now because teething  and healthy 6 month old  He was not a fussy newborn either  
Wow    you sound exactly like my boyfriend  Thank you for the advice    it can be so hard to get in someone's head who has anxiety when you don't have it yourself  I promise your girlfriend  and me  just want to make our boyfriends feel better 
I wish I got cancer but of course I kept this opinion to myself because cancer is a sensitive issue to many people  
I've experienced this in different situations  My body is there but my mind is somewhere completely different  like somebody said  this happens when I'm really anxious about something and then it leads me to zone out of things and generally become completely unaware of my surroundings 
After a long talk and explaining to my S O what specifically went down last night  I feel like we are on the same page and she apologized for her comments        After going through  the sources you all provided  mulling them over  cleaning and re cleaning the same things over and over and just giving time for everything to settle and process  I still feel pissed but knowing that there is a support group for this  someone to hear this out and give feedback on where to turn is just relieving  You have no idea how wonderful you all are  Thank you very much  It's weird for me to sit and stew on a certain thing and not just move on  I think I may be able to with the help that was provided 
I feel the same 
General Tso's is another favorite of mine  Esp when they don't make it too sweet   I saw a bird I have not seen before  a Townsend Warbler  I really want to go back and see what other birds I can find down by the river that I don't normally see 
I completely understand how you feel  I've been suffering from anxiety panic for 5 years now and I get palpitations and my heart races  sometimes feels like my heart is just going to stop and I will die  I felt better once I found this thread 
Same thing happened to me today as well  Hit me like a ton of bricks  
Thank you  but unfortunately I live in the UK  and any similar services don't seem to be as widespread or particularly useful  and are particularly few and far between for male support  I haven't found anything helpful online thus far  But thank you for the recommendation  and your support  It is truly appreciated 
I miss not being depressed     I wish to be happy in 2017 and cure my depression 
Omg that is my first thing I stop doing when the dark cloud cometh   I'm going through a really tough time right now and I'm going to go brush my teeth bc for some reason I thought this was just a "me thing" and I have been not doing this one small self care act lately  or washing my face before bed  or well   lots of little things  Wow  reading everyone's posts  I feel like I'm not alone here  sorry  newbie to Reddit    Thanks for the post   
I'm sorry to hear that  message me if you'd like to talk    Hope things get better for you  
I tried a new medication  even though I very much did not want to  I then either got sick or had a bad reaction to the medication  I'm emetophobic  so that's just loads of fun   I would usually spend all of my time pacing outside because it soothes me and because I have a superstition that I won't vomit if I'm outdoors   Instead  I have mostly stayed in bed and tried to take care of myself 
I deeply relate to you  I don't feel good  Mentally and physically  It's one thing to always be mad or sad  but it shows more when you start losing hair and throwing up like every week   At least I can seek comfort in posts like yours  I don't feel so alone  Thanks 
Ive had mine gone for a year and it feels relieving doesnt it  I like being on the low instead of on social media  Like all hidden  Facebook is for mindless people that sit around and judge those who don't live like them lol 
23 y o  male here  kill me plz 
I suppose but man  I feel like you have it or you don't  I just can't gety fingers to move that fast and independent of each other  It's just one of those things where you got it or you don't  and I don't  I'm so fucking bad at everything and I doubt that'll change  
Often those who do not respond to an SSRI at a low dose do not see improvement with a higher dose  That being said  theoretically  a dose change from 20mg to 30mg is safe  This is not medical advice to change your dose without your doctor's permission  You may want to see your doctor regarding a change in medication  If you call in you may be able to see your doctor sooner   Medications in the same family as paxil  escitalopram lexapro and sertraline zoloft have been proven to be more safe and more efficacious for the treatment of depression and anxiety  Cipriani  2009  
Every time I read articles of terminally ill patients receiving assisted suicide  I can't help but feel jealous  
Not the guy you asked  but I find  r wholesomememes and  r absolutelynotme irl to be pretty interchangeable  so it doesn't bother me  Probably worth mentioning I don't really read the comments though 
Yup worst case you can take meds and lose weight and self manage  Lots of people live that way 
Can't think of one that I feel comfortable with  so really I just have to deal with it really 
I feel so alone  And worthless  My life is falling apart and I'm losing the love of my life   I don't know if I can keep going
Tapering is done over weeks or months  not days  To your body  you essentially quit cold turkey 
No problem     It can be hard but it gets better  just remember to have some patience  4yrs with your bf its a lot time so its worth it     if your bf hasn't gotten any medical help  he should  It has helped me tremendously  
     hugs      
Yeah  one minute I'm relaxed then I start thinking of what might happen or how my voice will sound  then I'm fully tensed up a second later and my heart starts beating profoundly  This is me when I'm put on the spot  I don't if you meant if we were to be relaxing in our home then start thinking about SA 
Side effects of missing sertraline would be uncomfortable  but not life threatening  Starting back on a higher dose of sertraline once it has cleared your body will amplify all the side effects you may have had when you started it    namely lightheadedness  again  uncomfortable but not necessarily life threatening  This of course is not medical advice  and your doctor will probably have someone covering for them while they are on vacation 
2 thoughts      1  Why dismiss drugs AND therapy    2  I suppose it would depend on the tic

I'd get one  stat    Unless I was feeling awful   Then I'd get one after as soon as it passed   EDIT   I don't want to die   At least  not all the time   I suppose those would be considered more desirable frames of mind   I just don't know if I'll be in a position to get help  ever  considering how I am   I simply realize that my sensitivity to death and suicide is slowly eroding  I can project the probable implications 
There might be side effects to increasing the dose  which might in turn not make anything much better  You should really talk to your Doctor beforehand unless it was discussed earlier 
Thank you so much  That is so helpful  Would you recommend consultation with a maternal fetal medicine specialist before becoming pregnant  
Being happier and making people around me happy
That means so much  way to go  The struggle with depression and hygiene is very real
I have a correlation between my anxiety and temperature  the cold causes anxiety and when I'm anxious I get cold  The cold always feels like it's radiating from inside of me though  and it causes my rib cage to vibrate  and if it goes on long enough my teeth and hands will start chattering and shaking   I think it's best to  instead of trying to learn how to handle each individual side effect that your anxiety causes and feeling overwhelmed that there's just so many symptoms to deal with  first off just try and focus on calming your mind and putting yourself into calm environments  Then it would probably be a good idea to start getting down to the root of the issue  talk to a psychiatrist or someone to work on how to combat your anxiety rather than your anxiety's symptoms 
floating  waiting to leave 
I'm sort of open minded about drugs  hard to explain  but therapy would be completely humiliating   Facial motor tics mainly 
Been there and done that with the whole college thing  I too was bitter about what happened after high school and nobody staying in touch  I've learned to let that go but again  like you it has affected my ability to connect and meet likeminded people  I honestly believe it's mentally damaged me being let down like that  Just like when somebody gets cheated on for example  it never really goes away   When I was in college the only form of social contact I had was fellow students on my course  Outside of lesson time though my time was spent messing about on the computers playing games and browsing Reddit to try and find people in my situation  It was an extremely lonely experience which escalated the depressive feelings  Even though I rarely spent time with my classmates outside of lesson time  I still genuinely thought they cared about me  which messed me up even more    I hardly trust people now a days  Saying that though I decided to say fuck it and get two tattoos which are both reminders that I am going forwards and to not look back  Right now I've only got a part time job but even that's 10 000 times better than being in that hellhole of a place  You're not alone man  things can work out  I just unfortunately don't really have answers as I'm dealing with it myself  
this is like an exact mirror image of me  the reason why i got on reddit today was to make a post about it to clear my head and get some advice  i don't know how to stop fixating on these things  the physical manifestations seem so real and god forbid i get sick or have a headache it's just downhill from their  i know this isn't advice  but it helps me to know that i'm not the only one going through this  i hope it helps you 
I'm sorry  Feel free to message me if you'd like to talk  
Mine did a preliminary diagnosis after the first session and then always updated it  I dont know if every psychiatrist is like this  or if they have to allow it  but I could always see it when I wanted 
My friend bikes  it works well for him 
Augmentation is very common in the treatment of mood disorders when a patient sees a partial response to a medication like Zoloft  but still would benefit from further medical therapy  Abilify is a very common agent used for augmentation 
Not helpful for me  But everyone is different  
Nothing much is on my mind right now  just extremely worried about my future  I'm feeling quite upbeat for a change  not sure why  better make the most of it  How about you OP  
I think I'd say the same  too  Anxiety is more of a constant thing but the level of depression comes and goes  I do think you're right about just knowing what's going on  That would probably be a good step in the right direction  I'll be setting up an appointment at the counseling center as soon as campus reopens  Thanks very much for your thoughts 
Possibly  however only a professional can diagnose you    Since this concerns you I'd strongly suggest requesting a referral through your primary care physician   Please don't do what I did  avoided getting help until my symptoms led me to consider a life threatening action     I am living proof that things can get better   IF you ask for help   Best of luck to you 
If you bring SA as an excuse then your "not wanting" is not genuine but actually a coping mechanism  Like the fox and the sour grapes 
I hate social media  I only follow photography pages on Instagram and use messenger to stay in touch  I have unfollowed basically every vain self centred asshat I had followed back in school  There's a saying "social media is a show real featuring only your best parts" and that's all they really are  people pretending that they live these amazing fantasy lives  Why do they do it  Self worth  Attention  Who the fuck knows  all I know is that it's cancer 
That is exactly how I feel    I never had friends or anyone who liked me when I was just being myself  I had to craft up this fake me that was my antithesis in every aspect of my personality  Or they use me b c I have good grades  comparatively   Or they just end of up using my "sweetness"  quoting from someone else not my own words  and toying with it for their pleasure  Now that I have junior year creeping up my ass I can't succumb to this pressure either  It's like I'm backed in a corner and I have to go forward  Only reason suicide isn't an option is b c I have an autistic brother and a financially tight family that needs me to succeed  Wanna pm sometime 
I'm not satisfied with my lifestyle  I just feel helpless  I have no friends  I long for a close friend  I don't want "friends" who just want to socialize party etc  I want someone I can talk to  trust  confide in  vacation with  Always sad  never happy  I've offered to help someone "close" and was turned down  that hurt   I want to live by "treat others as you would like to be treated" but everyone is so content with how their lives are going  they already have their own group of close friends and wont really branch out anymore    no one has time in their life for people like me
Have you checked this support group   http   www dbsalliance org site PageServer pagename peer support group locator
I'll throw in my two cents  I totally get why you would say you'd want to drink more  It's simple  alcohol is an effective anxiolytic drug and mood lifter   My suggestion would be to learn how to use small to moderate amounts alcohol as a tool to feel more comfortable  Try to plan a fun night doing something you enjoy that you would usually drink heavily for  but instead of doing the usual  get two beers  one at a time  and slowly sip them over a couple hours  That way you can train yourself to see the benefits of smaller doses and improved clarity  My favorite nights of drinking have all been less than 5 drinks  many of them one or two    But don't knowingly take on a crutch  especially not one so incredibly toxic  Not to be too morbid but my sister died at 27 because she got comfortable with using massive amounts of vodka day in and day out to help her cope with her anxieties and depression  There are much better suited drugs available if you do need daily assistence  Remember also that alcohol is one of the few drugs that going cold turkey on can cause death  so at the very least find a way to stop yourself from making it even a small daily habit   Edit  another drinking tip  most people think alcohol kicks in immediately or within a minute or two  The onset might happen that quickly  but the actual effects on the body and brain have a latency of 15 to 20 minutes  Binge drinking is really a risk because you can have an excessive volume of liquor  assume you're fine because you feel warm and happy 5 minutes later  then try to chase the feeling by doubling how much liquor you've drunk all before the negative effects of overdoing it with the first drink kick in  So by drinking less concentrated alcohol more slowly  you can have more fun while keeping you and everyone else around you safe
Do you know for sure  
Always happens to me when I have a cold  I tend to get a stomach ache and pretty often  diarrhea   especially if I've been coughing a lot or have a runny stuffy nose  Don't worry  you already know you have a cold and those symptoms don't go hand in hand  You're not sick with anything but the little cold  Don't let it worry you  
I wonder  in bed or seated "active activities"  Thinks like stretches  crunches  pulls  holds  etc  Disclaimer that I  thanking the heavens  haven't gotten to the point where getting out of bed is too much to consider on a regular basis   The first step is sitting up  I guess my thought is that if you sit up  you can start thinking "oh  sitting up is the starting position for this stretch or that pose  why don't I give that a try"  then you're at least getting a bit moving  which could help with the "fog"   Completely lost the rest of the thought train there  sorry  I'll let you know if I find it 
she just gave you a lame nonsensical excuse   try not to dwell too hard on that loser 
I've been friendless  so to speak  for like five years now  It's not a good place to be  In my situation I ruined important friendships with words  but that put me in a state of social shock where I just can't handle friendship anymore   It's hard to make friends with anyone if you aren't spending time with them to begin with  People don't just meet and make friends  I don't even waste my time thinking about the opposite gender these days  When I encounter one I try not to pay any attention  because it's pointless   I think you still have hope  Are you at the point where you mass delete innocent facebook contacts  Are you so terrified of communication that you can barely communicate with people in person or on the internet  Is your suffering a product of your own selfishness where ambition has been replaced with instant gratification   If not  I think you still have hope  I think it's ok to go a few months to a year feeling friendless  but if it goes any longer you have to redefine friendship to suite what's available to you for the sake of sanity 
just start banging lots of women bare back  eventually it will work out  Might not happen before all that pleasure changes your outlook  but don't get anyone prego  that would fuck up a 2nd life 
Every fucking day  I know that suicide will hurt my mother and sister  so I hope that I wake up with heart disease or an aggressive cancer  Unfortunately  I am too healthy and stuck living a life I never wanted  
I wish i could do that  i already do a lot of my own stuff looking after myself  sadly i'm not legally allowed to move out until i'm 18  i turn 15 this year so i have 3 more years until i can move out    
Wow it seems like the world's really piled it on  I'm sorry  That's really shitty  and I hope that you're able to have a day or two to regroup and be able to take the new year on  
no because I can easily off myself at any time by getting some drugs in Mexico and technically  if I do have depression  then that took my life   not me 
This sub is completely useless for helping depressed people  
Well fuck me up a wall  I managed a full half hour  only 7 5 mins below that level 4 in total and even managed Level 5    Feels nice when you're not even sure you're going to make it 10 minutes 
Yeah  i already go to a counselor in my own time      
Very proud of you  Thank you for bringing this up  I thought I was alone in this and so many people are posting similar things  Happy New Year 
Mid 20s too  I wish i could say something to make u feel better but i cant  because i feel exactly the same  I think " Unmanageable" is a word that perfectly describes my anxiety  I am in therapy but had not made any progress about this issue so im really considering medication  I can only tell you that i understand u and i really wish one day we all can overcome this 
yes definitely  I feel like I'm watching myself in a movie or something   
 For me life is hell but i know that there is a person that has it worse   "Telling someone they shouldn't be sad because someone else has it worse is the same as telling someone they shouldn't be happy because someone else has it better"  Some guy probably  or maybe some girl    I feel you completely though  There's a fine line between trying to make it clear that you have your cross to bear  and putting yourself up on that cross  I hate the feeling of being pitied  but at the same time depression is part of my experience and I need to be able to honest about that fact  It's tough  
same  sometimes I say I'm just tired  it's almost like a taboo to mention the word  
Well  don't let your mind race too far ahead  Deal with one thing at a time  Maybe you don't have it  And if you do  yes it might suck  but you'll figure out how to be fine  I bet your parents will be sympathetic and understanding rather than blaming you  
Yep same here  
I'm the same when someone is yelling angrily  I hate angry tones  It's upsets my anxiety and my heart starts racing  
yeah i already go to a counselor in my own personal time and thank you for the support  my parents aren't physically abusive at all but they do definitely not help with the things they say to me   
Hopefully telling your doctor about it will be a huge relief and he can help you deal with it  That's awesome and brave and so hard to do  but it'll be worth it
Unfortunately I think you're pretty right about that  A lot of threads go without responses  Responses themselves are often not people trying to help OP  but trying to receive help themselves  I don't know  This place does give people a place to vent and feel like they're not alone with their problems  That's something at least  
I been feeling like that too  Just tired of living
I'm the same way except I'm contemplating suicide so that I don't have to be around for the deaths   I honestly dread one day hearing   your mother is dead   I don't want to hear that 
Not too great but I have enough experience with depression now to work through it  even a little bit  
To be honest you may have made her feel unwanted  I would have picked her up   Still a lame excuse to break up but still   all she wanted was a ride home and you left her hanging  If you had asked your girlfriend for a ride home because you could not drive  how would you feel  I would pretty rejected and not thought of   
Well it's a new year and all i know is that i find comfort in computers  producing music  and cutting myself  Nobody around me understands shit thats going on with me and i don't care to explain to them either 
I'm the same way  but I just kinda shut down and have a full blown episode  Married  and I left the abuse 4 years ago  My husband understands  but he does have a quick temper so this happens nearly daily     
Luckily I'm rarely on social media  so I don't have the issue of blocking people out of my life  I do sometimes obsess over Snapchat  which imo is one of the most toxic social media platforms  But for the most part my main issue is not with making friends  necessarily  but with keeping them  I'm not bad at being friendly  funny  or interesting  People still decide not to become friends with me  I'm hopeful that I'll figure it all out  but it's hard when people you grew up with suddenly kick you out of their lives  It makes me hate myself  even when deep down I believe there's nothing wrong with me 
it isn't just because of my parents  its also because of school as i used to get bullied since year 3  i dont really get bullied much now but i don't have many friends  i also have many other things what have contributed but those are the main things  
Maybe sometimes we don't want to hear the truth  We want to hear something which says you'll do great  It'll all workout  No big deal  It's tough for you but it'll be okay cuz you are not the only one 
Hugs with SO are the best thing   
really  they haven't harmed me physically in any way besides once and i always hear about more abusive family's compared to mine 
Sadly I don't think people view it that way 
You aren't throwing your life away at all  it's just taking a little bit longer than expected  I did 7 months of an 8 month medical assistant program and dropped out because it didn't feel like it was actually preparing me for the job  Now I'm about to sign up for nursing school  8 years later  so i'm in the same boat basically  Don't feel like a failure  You'll get there  
i do currently go to a councilor in my own time and i dont really have anybody to talk to at school   thank you for the support
This sounds fine to me I doubt your friend even noticed honestly 
im sorry that you are going through that too    
I already had a panic attack and crying session  Wow great year so far 
Are you unsatisfied with life  With other people   Sometimes bad feelings come about in situations where you should otherwise feel good  Usually a good scare will open my eyes to the things in life I shouldn't take for granted  If I screw something up  I tend to work harder as a result  Maybe you've been working so hard and so well that you don't think it's important anymore   It's important to find perspective as you get older  Life isn't perfect  but there are a lot of things that are good about it  There are likely many things that you can experience that other will never have the opportunity to do  even if it's something mundane like walking around the kitchen or using the internet  You could have been a slave or a fallen soldier or an insect or something  but you are you and you don't have to be the greatest just to survive and have a good time now and then   It's very common for people of recent generations to feel a sense of purposelessness  In many ways  many have no purpose beyond what's within their reach  Purpose to oneself and purpose to other people  A person can do things to make them more important to other people  but that isn't necessary and probably impossible for everyone to participate in  Loneliness is tolerable as long as you don't focus on things that are beyond your reach 
It sucks  but finding the right med is all about trial and error  as everyone responds differently  You have to try the new med  wait a few weeks and see if it works  then get off that  possibly withdraw and try a new med for a few weeks  It's very time consuming and frustrating if you're not feeling any better  So at least you get some relief with the benzos   I hope you find something long term soon 
thank you  you too    
I tried to do this within the first week i noticed a huge change in my teeths color when taking picture they looked really white and then i started smoking    And now i have a mouth infection i think from eating too much spicy foods and not washing my teeth lol for like a week only washed em like 2 a week they look yellow not bad yellow idk if its a mouth infection or not buts something cuz i got bumps in my mouth and random cuts are appearing mom just keeps saying yeah its an infection but doesnt do any thing about it lol im 17 i cant do anything
NO  I dont think you are at all  forcing you to see someone who youve already hhad a bad experence with is stupid
I already had a mental breakdown and I think I inflicted some damage to myself during a verbal batter with my S o  
I am the same way because of my childhood too  I avoid doing anything to make people angry is mostly means I just avoid them lol  
im so sorry to hear that you are in the same situation as me       
i don't know for sure   but she said she was going to 
So now whats your next goal  "Its the little things that matter "
Oh I'm sorry to hear that  Have you seen a doctor counsellor at all  Do you can you speak about it with your friends   family 
I'm addicted to TV but it's hard for me to watch movies  I think it's because a lot of "good" movies are depressing and I just want to watch a comedy so I can shut my brain off for a while  I have a theory that depressed people love comedy because we need the escape  and my friends who like serious dramatic entertainment don't suffer from the depression or anxiety that would make them affect you  Just throwing that out there  
Yes totally agree i thought i was the only one  Computers make me feel normal Im going to school for network engineering its the first time Ive ever been excited for institutionalized learning my entire life  Xbox is also another good way and it turns out you find people on xbox that arent shitty like people irl  
I can empathize with your feelings  What helps me is sitting down and really thinking about what truly makes me happy  I suggest getting to know yourself during this time  You want to eat dinner  go eat dinner  You want to see a movie  go see it  You want to read a book  read a book  You wanna take a walk  do it  Often times we feel like we're losers because we're alone but the truth is  in order to be truly happy we must know ourselves and do what makes us happy  Once we figure out how to be truly happy without others around  we start to attract the right kinds of people    I was really depressed and sometimes I still get down but I remember the things that I truly love to do and make me happy  I'm really shy and introverted but I like books  so I started going to small bookstores perusing the shelves for interesting reads  I like football so I'll grab a cheap ticket to a football game and go alone  I LOVE different kinds of food so I started trying new restaurants and online recipes that I think I may enjoy  Take the time to enjoy your own company  It doesn't make you a loser  it makes you smart  And once you truly get to know yourself  like I said  you start to attract people who like similar things  I met a really cool guy at a Chargers game who sat next to me and we are now bonding because he was doing something similar by going to the games alone too  He too  was feeling like a loser and lonely but after getting out  doing the things that he wanted to do  he  like myself  found people who were in similar situations    Often times we feel like nobody understands but in reality  there are more people than you think dealing with similar feelings  Once you get to know yourself  I promise it gets easier  It doesn't happen overnight  especially if you're like me and have social anxiety but if you put forth the effort and truly become ok with being alone  I promise it'll get easier 
i already try to avoid them as much as possible  thank you for the support
Are you in the USA  If so  check out your local Community Service Board  CSB   They have sliding scales for services  If you google it for your state you should get a list  Good luck
Well as scary as it is  you need to find out  Call her  go to her  just be supportive of her  make her know she loved  
Thank you  But I've been apart of them for 6 months  For example that one subreddit hasn't been active for 2 weeks  Like Jesus Christ  This is suppose to be one of the largest cities in America and I can't find anything  Wtf
I feel the same  I don't think I'm ever gonna change tbh 
no i live in Australia  the earliest you can work is 14 here  thank you for the concern though  
I have been dealing with severe health anxiety since around the age of 12  currently 23y   It comes and goes in waves  and as of now I'm experiencing it rather severely  For me  therapy has been vital  I have an appointment with a new therapist in two weeks  and I've been waiting to go for over a month  It's been getting to the point where I've been unsure if I can make it that long   Coping wise  stay off google  Try your best to not focus in on every little twinge and pain  This has been difficult for me  I need to take my own advice  Find a therapist  if you have health insurance see what that will cover  If you are in university  most colleges offer counseling for very little if not completely free 
yes i watched their summer marathon too   
It's a bit more complicated than your understanding  but yes  you can  effectively  reverse diabetes if you lose the weight and be healthy  That doesn't mean that it won't always be something to monitor  but you'll be a far cry from losing limbs and whatnot   You're young  you still have a chance  However the longer you let this go on  the smaller that chance becomes  If you're terrified now just to see a doctor  use that energy to invest in yourself   
Yeah  I don't know   Maybe my parents are just assholes for charging me rent   But where I live a single bedroom apartment goes for 600 1200 depending on how good the neighborhood is   I can't afford that I barely make 1500 take home pay a month as it is   I don't have anyone in mind that I would be comfortable living with    What did you eat for 50 bucks a month   Ramen    I'm working on my student loan  I sold a car recently and I'm going to put all 8k towards my debt   My life is so boring and poor though  I can't afford to do anything now   
Glad to hear that  It just aggravated the fuck out of my insomnia  
Nobody ever needs to be alone  I am sure there are adults that care but it is OK if you have not found someone you trust yet     What things do you enjoy doing outside of school  
The friend that insists you don't have Bipolar  where did they get their PhD   I'm just curious 
I didn't understand what i was supposed to be celebrating  Was i supposed to be happy i made it to another year  eh  Fun for everyone else maybe 
apparently the cops won't care about what they are doing  according to them 
Why does the nomenclature matter so much  You know who you are  and you know how you act  You can use the classification to help yourself  but nothing about you has charged  only how much you know to help yourself      
Same here  sadly  Meds have helped with it a bit though   don't get teary eyed from emotional reaction to anger insults
i already go to a counselor in my own time out side of school    thank you for your concern though
Heard that  I skipped around schools so I never had a good couple of years or so to make friends  and my job kind of sucks  not a lot of friend material  It just gets harder as you get older 
I've had both drugs and therapy  It's not humiliating to have therapy  You do want to find a therapist you click with  which won't necessarily be the first one you try    So  what I was thinking when I asked on the kind of tic was kind of this  that some things   like the one where people swear compulsively   would be more clearly unacceptable  whereas  for some things  I wonder if you might    decide not to mind them  My sister has this thing where she is an incredibly picky eater  and she would find it hard to go out to eat with friends because what if they didn't have anything she liked to eat  or what if they thought it was weird that she would only eat certain stuff  Eventually I said to her  look  if you don't want to change it  then why don't you just own it  Be like  this is how I am  and that's ok  And just expect other people to be ok with it too  Another one is this girl I know who has a compulsive sneeze  She was a grad student and sometimes in the middle of someone else's special talk she'd just start sneezing these incredibly loud sneezes  a whole bunch in a row  which  as you can imagine  is a lot more disruptive than a facial tic would be   After I met her  I discovered that she didn't even seem to be self conscious about it   was just very matter of fact that she had this thing and couldn't help it   and after that I just accepted it  She was very sweet and winsome and I came to like her so much    But yeah  I mean  it's either change or accept it  as far as I can think  and drugs and therapy would be the ways to change it  Wish I could tell you to find a blue pebble under a harvest moon  boil it in catnip tea  coat it in chocolate and swallow  but   
im sorry to hear that     
Honestly I'm a mess  I can't take my mind of any of my worries or concerns for even a minute  If I try to distract myself the thoughts come back no matter what  I'm miserable  I'm constantly afraid something extreme is about to happen to me medically  I'm terrified I'll have an anaphylactic reaction to any food so it's also impacting how I eat  I have break downs in public places  If I'm alone  forget about it  I've been trying to schedule an appointment with a therapist for months  and have one now in two weeks  I'm not even sure if I can make it that long  I wake up in the middle of the night with my heart racing  I have almost constant chest cramps and pain  radiating around my rib cage  My jaw hurts and I keep pushing my tongue hard against my teeth so it's creating these ridges in my tongue  but I've convinced myself it's because my tongue is swollen and my throat is about to close  My anxiety isn't limited to health but it's heavily dominating it right now   It's impacting my ability to function and work  relationships with friends and family  my relationship with my boyfriend  I'm so miserable  I know I'll be ok  But right now it feels like I'll never be   Thank you for listening 
Bipolar is a condition known to sometimes go into remission  Remission is NOT PERMANENT  It's temporary  Eventually you may find yourself in deep shit again  and it's often easier to simply prevent this rather than risk it broadsiding you    Also  mild depression or hypomania can totally "fly under the radar" and leave us thinking we're okay when  in reality  we are not  We just don't remember things being "off"   Nobody here can tell you if your diagnosis was accurate or not  There are so many  many factors involved  It might be worth a visit with a pdoc  to explain your history to them and get an informed opinion 
there are no words    i'm so sorry as best you can  surround yourself with kind people and try to just keep putting one foot in front of the other
hmm i know    sadly we cannot choose who our parents family are  and i know a lot more people have it worse then me too   
I am the opposite  whenever their is conflict I get amped up and ready to go  I guess 18 years of ice hockey will do that to you  P
I binge watched the new season of Black Mirror  Honestly  I wasn't too upset with that night  Most upsetting was not having any invites  and I'm not looking forward to people asking me what I did because I feel like a loser saying I didn't do anything  But I think there's a lot of us that didn't do anything  if it makes you feel any better 
I doubt it  It doesn't change reality  Unless you're getting lit with your favorite people doing your favorite things accomplishing fantastic achievements and experiencing life changing epiphanies  it's just a temporary relief   I use  but it doesn't change the facts of what keeps me down  Some things can never be fixed  Pot is a pleasant distraction  something to look forward to  but it can put me in a worse mood sometimes that I have to beat out of my head before I feel relaxed   Maybe it depends on the person  Maybe an overworked grad school yuppie could get out of a rut by smoking a joint on the weekend  but for a forever depressed and purposeless person to do it on their own  they might as well do it every day because that's all it's good for 
Watching for suggestions  Same problem  
You are not alone  So many people have fears of doctors  I myself used to be terrified of doctors  But now I have great relationships with all my doctors  The fact of the matter is that   avoidance   is actually your worst enemy  The more you avoid the doctor  the scarier they become in your mind    What you need to know is this  Doctors don't give you disease  they give you remedies for the conditions that you are already suffering through  You are already doing the hard part  which is dealing with pain and suffering of anxiety    When you go to the doctor  they just tell you what the problem is and offer you options  I always like to stress the word   options   because doctors don't make you do anything  They just offer you solutions and let you decide    If I were you  I would make an appointment with your GP and tell them that you are experiencing some physical issues but that you think it may be related to hypochondria  You just want to come in and get their opinion    This is great because it tells your doctor that you would like to help deal with anxiety on top of your physical issues  They will be able to offer you solutions for your anxiety that may help to reduce all of your physical symptoms     
I've had a dramatic experience in early 2016 which resulted in the loss of all my friends  I think the best thing to do in this situation  as I'm still pulling myself out of it  is taking this as an opportunity to learn more about yourself  Yeah  it's a lil' cheesy  but I really benefited from it  Separate yourself from all of your ex pals  and take a little while to be independent and focus on your personal development  Friends will find you  you just have to let them  A lot of people are suggesting you join clubs  and I really agree with them because that's probably the only reason I have some kind of friends right now 
Same  I'm trying to figure out ways to improve myself and figure out a way to get out of this hell hole  
thats the one thing that motivates me to keep on going  i know that eventually things will change  i dont know if it will be better or not though   i plan on moving out as soon as i hit 18  or maybe even earlier if i end up having a close friend at that time 
Don't be afraid of therapy  I'm in my early 20s  23  and about to go back  I've had anxiety my entire life and it helped so much  Make an appointment and get out of your comfort zone  Welcome to 2017 
I just hate how its all brain crap thinki g in cicles and never escaping  like theres no escape  sleeps alright  dieing is a garranteed escape but what we all really want is to just be better  until you cant imagine better  which is fucking horrible
thank you for your support
I enjoy playing video games  but now it's getting to the point where I'm showing a lack of interest towards games  I enjoy basketball  even though I'm not good at it  but recently moved and there's no basketballs courts around where I live 
thank you for your support
i currently live in Australia and no  but i do talk to a Counselor in my own time outside of school
First  I would be PISSED that your bf and co driver didn't tell you this beforehand  Not even on an emetophobic level here  it's just plain decency   Second  did you put your hands in your mouth at any point before you got to wash your hands  If not  try and relax  I'm trying to think of what I would tell myself if I were in your shoes  Well  I'd wash my shoes  haha  sorry   Here's the thing  It may not have necessarily been contagious  Mexico has some   funky water in some places  And food  Food poisoning is a huge possibility  The only way things like that are cought "through the air" is when vomiting or diarrhea happens and the particles come up in the air  and are breathed in and swallowed  From nasal passage to throat  until they settle to the ground again  I hate to put this image in your head but just for reference  think of dropping a water balloon and the way the water will splash up then settle down  Kinda like that  You were not a part of that   Honestly  going through the rational part of my own mind  I'm thinking if you didn't lick your shoes  your hands or put your face near anything there  you should be alright  Clean up your car the best you can  dilute a fresh bottle of bleach in some water and wipe down what you touched in your car    Keep me updated here  I have no school for a couple days  I should be around     Take it easy  
Again  thank you for sharing  I can relate to a lot of what you are saying  Something that can help me is realizing that some of these "issues"  maybe situations  or struggles  are the result of major societal things going on and it's not just me 
I just want to be better  It's hard imaging the future  but I want the future I think  I want friends and happiness and laughter and love   
I've been having a tough week  I wanted to help some people out  but it backfired on me  Might lose a friend because I might have lost her trust in the process  Thus  I have reverted to having suicidal thoughts  In other news  I started a journal to list things I experience and feel that relates to my mental health 
I feel this way too  and sometimes it's better to focus on yourself and your future  but not to live by the future  Maybe plan for happier and better things  and live happily    
Okay  I understand  How come you'd wait 
What things  if you don't mind me asking 
Yes  The best way to describe it is it's like being high on marijuana  without the psychoactive aspect  if that makes any sense 
You cannot  You will have to activate your account to use messenger 
Ah ok
Wow  Spot on  Thanks for the share  
Is there a local hospital you can contact   If so  chances are they have a few local resources for you  Also  check your local library town hall bulletin boards   Best of luck  I hope you find the support you crave   
"Thing 1" is acting like a shit friend for down playing your issue to nothing  Let me guess     "Everyone goes through similar issues  that doesnt make you bipolar" is the argument   Explain to them  if they cant be apart of the support system then dont give any input  If they dont respect it  Drop them   Their are websites that do live chats as a group in regards to having support   As far as making new friends with the same issue or worse     The intent is well  but you being 18  you dont understand the concept of not getting overly involved with other issues you dont need in your life   With or without mental health issues a good friend should be able to respect the disorder and carry on as normal  Dont feel limited  and dont over extend yourself to people   
Okay  Do you feel as if that'll be different with a different therapist 
I feel worse because I know nobody will ever actually say these things to me 
Definitely because the hug can become intimate with roaming hands haha  Hugs with SO can be affectionate and sexual making them more emotional and intimate fulfilling multiple needs at once  while hugs with everyone else is limited to just affection 
I have this  I have this horribly bad  It's kind of like a form of PTSD  a mild one though  You have a traumatic experience  Whatever is traumatizing to you   you have a deja vu like feeling where your body physically or mentally feels sensations before that lead to something bad happening  your brain will associate it with that almost every time  You say you almost get flashbacks  I definitely have those flashbacks  They send me into a spiral of anxiety every time    The only thing that has worked for me  May not work for all  is distractions  I mean  it has to be something a little intense like a very busy video game  Lots going on   have the radio playing at the same time  You're basically trying to drown it out and have your brain associate the feeling with something other than bad vibes  Meditation  breathing exercises and yoga work for others   You may never forget past experiences  but there are ways to have a simple thought about them and be able to shrug it off 
I think your first step should be to see a therapist or doctor  It's going to seem extremely daunting and intimidating but  in order for you to truly overcome this you must seek professional help  I know advice from reddit can be comforting and it's a hell of a lot easier than dealing with a doctor but  you need whats best for you    Go see a doctor  things will get better   
There's no easy way to make depression just disappear  drugs may just help you manage it but likely won't cure you
Yeah I know anti Natalism  I majored in philosophy and my old roommate did too  We talk about all sorts of stuff like this  Though I do appreciate the recommendation  I'll probably lurk around an anti Natalism sub later 
Agreed  I'm not encouraging suicide by any means  but don't traumatize another human being in carrying it out  if that is the decision you've made  There are cleaner ways  
I'm crying right now 
 I'm very introverted and don't connect to a lot of people which makes it hard finding someone I actually want to date   I have a similar problem  I feel like I have a very rich and vivid inner life  but that's very difficult to share with other people  You spend so long coping with being alone it becomes hard to connect  
Not weed  but I tried MDMA once and it was like I remembered what being happy felt like  Haven't done it since but I've been happier overall since then  Weed helps with my anxiety tho
Hi  Sorry to hear about your struggles  Would it be an option to print out or write down what you just wrote and hand it to a therapist and general physician  I understand you said that you're scared of going to the doctor  which is very common  by the way   but would it make it easier if you show them your post instead of talking directly to them  It could take a lot of pressure off of you  You expressed yourself very well and provided important information that can help them help you  Keep in mind that seeing a doctor doesn't automatically mean you'll be prescribed psychiatric medication  nothing wrong with that though  I'm on psych meds myself    It can be helpful to get a blood test ordered and a check up done though  A therapist can provide support  teach coping skills  help you move forward  help you challenge any negative thoughts  give you a private place to express yourself  and give you objective feedback on your struggles   All of this is entirely your decision  so there's no pressure coming from me  If you decide to go down this route  you may be able to schedule an appointment online with your school's mental health counseling center  if you're in the US  they may be called CAPS  which stands for Counseling and Psychological Services or something similar to that   Your school's health center should have a general physician you can meet with   Lastly  if you have any questions  like what types of questions you would be asked by a professional  how to prepare for a first appointment  how first appointments usually go  or my personal experiences with professional help   then don't hesitate to ask me  Feel free to send a message anytime  
Yeah    if it's possible for you to set out clothing food car keys etc the night before that can help  although not much will get you out of bed if you don't want to   Depression definitely sucks  I've lost so many years to it    
Whether I talk in front of a group of people  I feel like I am not even speaking  only listening 
'What a beautiful name'   I don't even really identify with my name
Not okay  but alive  I appreciate you asking 
thank you for the support
If it's actually a pimple  then it's not cancer  Scrotum pimples are pretty common and harmless  I hope that's all it is 
sorry to hear that    
thank you for the support
So therapy is way more of an art than a science  so it's really hard to just say "Here's what is going to happen and what it'll do to you"   I had one useless therapist  one so so one  and two that I got a lot of progress with   And all four had really different methodologies   Dr Drew talks how half of therapy is just sitting down with someone  learning what it feels like to be comfortable and uncriticized  and then share your true self with them   Half of the progress you'll get is just in learning how to bond with another person   Many of us have never had this  and are stuck in a constant "If I share my true thoughts  I'll get attacked"   The huge progress I've made is when I am able to understand my underlying thought process  I E  I always had SA and felt bad talking to people or using up their time  but it wasn't until a really specific interaction that I uncovered this direct "If I make a mistake  the other person judges me badly  then they leave  then I feel unlovable and worthless"   I never could have understood that process without the help of an objective third party   In regards to crying  the first time I went in with a "I never feel emotions  I used to joke with coworkers about us being dead on the inside  no clue why I don't enjoy things or feel sad ever" and as soon as I sat down and made eye contact with him  I burst into tears   It was kind of funny looking back  but I just spent so long with no real personal contact  no one interested in me personally  no actual human interaction with depth   It was kind of shocking but made me certain that I had an actual problem that I needed to work on   The problem with your questions  is that imagine asking them about a car mechanic   If you know your car isn't working right  you find someone who is trained to help  and you pay them to help   You do want to get your money's worth  and you do want to make sure they are competent  but there's often no way to do so without trying them   It's a hard thing   I had to take on an idea of "This is a doctor  I'm just going to show up there  put myself in his hands  tell him what is wrong  and do whatever he said" and turns out therapy doesn't really work like that  but it helped   Let me know if you could use any other info encouragement 
I thought about that question often and come up with different answers each time  So I don't know  The other question is  "Do I even want to try " At this point  no 
Thank you  Feels good to hear from someone similar  
I always feel like there is some great grid of social connectedness to which I am not plugged in  and I can never quite seem to find my own cord or the receptacle that would accept it   The best days I can fake it  and sometimes almost feel it  the worst days I feel like there is a wall of glass between myself and everyone else and I am trapped behind it   This has kept a lot of people from getting to know me  and as a result  I have very few friends  I just run on a different wavelength  
Fuck man It's interesting how me and a lot of other people look at Holidays as the WORST days to look forward to  It's hell because everyone is happy around you  and you just want as many hours at work as you can to needle and numb the fucking pain  Fuck holidays  and fuck christmas  
thanks for the support    
You don't deserve those kind of people in your life at all  You need to find a positive place for sure   For now  I want you to try this  write down things about yourself you are proud of  Doesn't matter how big or small  or what it looks like next to someone else's accomplishment and whatnot  I want you to write it down  Then  write things that you enjoy doing  Wholesome things  preferably  Write down people that are good to you  Plan out a day for yourself and your friends  and enjoy it  If you feel like it's undeserved  just think back to those things you are proud of  and think of how many there are to come  Set some goals for you as a gift to yourself  you don't have to be who you were  You can't change the past  so why dwell on it  Look to what you have power over  the present and the future  There are so  so many possibilities  You might be thinking oh it's just sappy babble  but really  try it  Don't look too far ahead  you can't become a millionaire overnight  but look at whatever the next steps are in your life it's important to take things by steps  because sometimes you choose different paths along the way  Ex  Feeling out of shape  Don't think about how you need to be a bodybuilder  Think about how you'll go for a jog every day of the week for a month  Then plan where you want to go from there  R thexeffect is a great community for setting goals and following though with them  In fact  Reddit has many  many tools that can help you  Give yourself some worth  some purpose  Investing in oneself is always worth it  I want you to go out and celebrate  if not for the things you are proud of  then for the things that could be  a celebration of the potential that I know you have  If you want to talk  pm me  and happy birthday   
im so sorry you had to go through that  my parents are the same when it comes to convincing everyone that nothings wrong
Sometimes I get really sad  but I'm thankful to have a friend like  u snapundersteer that understands me  It's been rough  but he's always been there for me
Following this for future advice  I would just love to know more about being pregnant new mom while having bipolar for the someday that my husband and I are ready  I have a huge fear of PPD or worse psychosis 
Yeah  I sometimes feel the same way 
I don't think the veterans suffering from PTSD should have to create another subreddit   Speaking as a rape survivor  I think we all have a lot to learn from one another   Also  the group isn't really high traffic enough to necessitate splitting 
Take long daily walks  They help to clear the mind  In my opinion  depression is anger turned inward  Anger mostly at ourselves  Anger from not achieving satisfaction  But it takes skills to achieve satisfaction  Therefore skill development  any skill  is the key to being satisfied  ie happy  
Thank you  I will keep all this in mind  I'm honestly really scared for my future because I feel like I've already made up my mind to "knowingly take on a crutch " as you accurately put it  I guess because I was on SSRIs for a year  before I started drinking  and they made me feel about 60  better  and then I discovered alcohol which made me feel 100  better  to me the choice just seems obvious  maybe it's not logical  but it's just so goddamn tempting  I imagine myself this year  back on meds  feeling pretty good and a ok  and then I imagine myself carrying around a flask on me and taking a couple quick sips before social situations  and feeling fucking awesome  That second scenario sounds so much more favorable to me  I know it won't be something I'll be able to give up once I've started down that road  I know it'll probably ruin my health and could very well kill me before I hit 30  but right now  for whatever reason  it's an adventure I want to go on  I know it's not the right choice  but I've been trying to make what I thought were the right choices for most of my life  and clearly none of them have worked out in my favor because look where I am today and what I'm writing here  I just don't see the point in trying to improve anymore  because I'm pretty sure I'm just the type of person who naturally wants to self destruct 
I understand that feeling  And yes  it's totally normal    It's okay to    feel okay  It's okay to feel "over it" sometimes  and at other times feel actively upset about it  And I totally empathize with that feeling of guilt during the "over it" times  It feels like such a big thing to put behind you  And especially if you weren't believed by some people  it can feel like letting them "win" by letting go when they haven't even acknowledged it      But that emotional distance is a gift  And it's absolutely normal  There are a shocking number of people in the world who have suffered from sexual assault  and most of us get through our day just fine  Many of us  you'd never even know unless the subject came up  And it's okay to become one of those people someday  too  
Sometimes it helps to tell people and realize that they love you anyway  There are so few people that I have been able to tell  Many of my friends know I am BP1  but very few people know what that actually means 
That's good to know that you have found coping mechanisms that work 
My school had a BP therapy group   check with counseling psychological services  You might also have a local NAMI or DBSA chapter 
Thanks for the advice   I think she means well  she just thinks she knows more about psychology than she really does  There's also the fact that the only times she's seen me "manic" have been when I only felt slightly  pleasantly buzzed on hypomania  therefore  my symptoms do not exist  and I clearly only experience "normal" mood swings  Nevermind the fact that I tried to jump off a cliff   She does have many redeeming qualities  so in the meantime I'm just avoiding the topic with her 
I feel similar but with anime   Everyone in anime seems so happy and with amazing and interesting lives inhabiting great worlds   I know that it's all fiction but it still makes me super depressed it's like putting salt on a wound   Also it makes me envious how many anime fans spend thousands of dollars on figurines and merch I would like to be able to afford that but I'm a student with a minimum wage job 
It's all about meeting people in locations you like to visit  Maybe you like playing guitar  go to a music shop nearby or a music club and start meeting people with similar interest  Or if you really like your online friends make plans on visiting each other one day 
I am so happy I did this  I didn't delete it because its convenient as a log in but I did stop going on it  I never check it now and feel much better having done so  The messenger is still useful as well 
Shrinks for parents and a psych major  I think she's just accustomed to being the most psychologically knowledgeable person in the room at any given time  given that most people know next to nothing   and this has given her the impression that she's an expert  when clearly  she is not 
I get these symptoms for anxiety too  I've had anxiety my whole life though  I think panic attacks can be random even if you havent had anxiety in the past  How hard fast is your heart pounding  if it doesnt go away for a while just visit a doctor  you'll be fine tho
Your dad is ignorant  If a medical professional tells you you have it  odds are doctor is right  and your dad is wrong
Facebook memes are stupid anyway  
I dont know of any way  But  breathing deeply is good as it can help lessen physical anxiety symptoms  To do so consciously can help you mentally as well  as a sort of meditation  Try counting the breaths too  Or imagine doing something mindlessly repetitive to the breaths  like crocheting 
I was without social media for the last 4 years and only recently got it back for networking purposes  I do video production  and my depression has been noticeably worse since I got it back  Coincidence  
I think you should repost this in  r BipolarSOs  This is not really the right place   this is a place for people  with  bipolar disorder to find support  I don't know what is going on with your son  and I am sorry you're having such a bad time  but bipolar disorder does not involve  to the best of my knowledge  violent outbursts out of nowhere when someone's mood otherwise seems to be ok  I know mania often involves violence but I don't think mania can just suddenly start and stop like that  If this is mania related  obviously talking about consequences won't help   NAMI friend family support groups may also be helpful for you 
I'm perfectly fine with drugs just helping me manage 
Genesight com they help match med treatment your genome 
Focusing on overall stress instead of one particular instance sounds like a good idea  The problem is that she's a grad student so the stress and work never really goes away  Still  I think you have a good point about doing what I can to at least keep things clean around the house and help encourage exercise   two things I'm not very good at at the moment  
Maybe he gives such good advice from these kinds of experiences  
Oh  Regular alk therapy might help then  
I had to get an EKG recently  I think because I was going on vraylar  This is very normal 
I've had a similar experience with a friend who would be  constantly  texting me telling me how everyone hated him  how he wanted to die  how he was struggling and I was the only one there for him   even when he was at parties with people all around him    I eventually had to tell him to only message me like that when it was an absolute crisis   I said something to the effect of 'Look  I love you  but it makes  my  anxiety and depression much worse to have you texting me like that all the time  I'm still here if you need me  but I'd like it if you tried to talk to some of the people around you'    He still messages me occasionally  but I have space to myself now
I'd love to hear why you think so of yourself  Because I want to prove you wrong 
I mean in the immediate future  I just worry about this a lot 
My psychiatrist said medication doesn't alter your personality  It just strengthens the good parts of personality
Do you have health insurance  
Thanks for the link  Unfortunately  they don't have one in my area 
Pure O stands for pure obsession  If there is a compulsion  internally or otherwise  involved with obsessive thoughts  it is OCD  Pure O describes just obsessive and intrusive thoughts that cause distress but not the need to complete compulsions to eliminate that stress 
I'm currently in the same situation but with a popular outgoing girl  I guess we just gotta build up our courage and also accept the fact that we might get rejected  I send you the best of luck  Hopefully she says yes if you do ask her  I know this was of no help at all but atleast we're in for a treat if we do ask out our crush  Best of luck once again 
She has been seeing a therapist for a few months  I wouldn't say that she's not anxious in other parts of her life   she's high functioning and always fulfills her responsibilities  but it can take a big toll on her and sometimes she shuts down or needs a lot of coaxing and encouragement to get through a simple task like resetting a password to an account or calling her parents  I honestly have no idea if she's even considered medication   I'll float the idea of going with her to a therapy appointment  thanks 
My goals I made with my therapist are to make it 2 weeks at a job  make it six months at a job  and join a club in my area to meet people  
I'm sorry to hear about your struggles  That's a huge success though    if you have any questions  like what types of questions you would be asked by a professional  how to prepare for a first appointment  how first appointments usually go  or my personal experiences with professional help   then don't hesitate to ask me  Feel free to send a message anytime  
I did the same thing  It's been two weeks  Got rid of Instagram too  but decided to keep twitter because it's nice to vent every so often  I find I'm waaaayyyy less anxious and definitely more present  It's really helping  Good luck 
I myself have struggled with this opinion of myself    However I believe in something I was told once  That regardless of someone having it "worse"  everyone that has gone through something deserves attention and care to heal from it  
Have you tried therapy  I've had severe health anxiety my entire life and therapy is where I receive help that lasts for years  I'm about to go back because it's becoming sever again  I should have actually gone back years ago 
i think not
Hi  I'm sorry to hear about your struggles  Making the decision to see the doctor is a huge success though  I hope you can benefit from help as much as I  and many others I personally know  have benefited from it   I just wanted to let you know that if you have any questions  like what types of questions you would be asked by a professional  how to prepare for a first appointment  how first appointments usually go  or my personal experiences with professional help   then don't hesitate to ask me  Feel free to send a message anytime  
their are a lot of normies but once you find the right page it's pretty good
Spotify was my issue too  I cancelled my subscription with my Facebook connected Spotify account  then I made a new Spotify account and followed my old account with all of my old playlists  then deleted Facebook  Spotify was my excuse for not deleting Facebook for 2 years and I feel so liberated now 
Sorry  I wish I had something else  
yup i made an extra account with no friends except for my family for messaging purposes only
right  
  clusterfuck of a social spiderweb  hahahaa exactly 
make an alt acc and add the people u want to message  thats what i did
True  But really there are enough memes on Reddit that my meme intake is already saturated as it is 
yea lol the memes made me laugh and i used it for messaging but fuck it im willing to sacrifice that shit because in the long run  FB makes me feel like crap  
the good thing about deleting FB is that it instantly gives you the ability to sense fake friends and real friends  
Ive dealt w  dysthymia for a good portion of my life w  bouts of major depression here and there as well as anxiety issues  It also makes me not want to brush my teeth and due to health probs my teeth went from being perfect in 2005  to now I need full dentures  Cant afford it right now and I only have medicaid and there is a long wait to get into a dentist  My front top teeth are broken so bad I got a hole at the base of 2 of them i could stick a pencil eraser into  and the infection goes up to my sinus  and is making me ill  The pain is excruciating  If there is anything that will make your depression spiral out of control it is knowing your about to have all your teeth out at the age of 31  Its a most terrible kind of pain and feeling and it makes me have thoughts that Id rather not have about ending it  If I manage to get these teeth pulled it will be wonderful  or maybe not  Don't let depression take your teeth if u can help it 
well it's deleted and no one will be able to access your page or old photos unless you log back in and restore it 
Well said
my best friend that i've fallen in love with broke ties with me because i didn't approve of her doing drugs in a groupchat that she wasnt in and she got hurt and broke me off   i hurt so much 
 removed 
Yes
That's what I was thinking  It was just one of those weird thoughts that pops up into your mind  I doubt they even gave it a second thought but I've been anxious about it for days
no one deserves to be depressed   This is how you're experiencing your life     People experience depression differently   Some are more "high functioning "  Our outside world looks good but we hurt inside   The severity of depression is on a continuum   Some have a milder symptoms  others severe   It sounds like a bit of what's going on is a search for meaning and mission in your life   It's hard to not have some identity   
You won't know until you  try it   will you  I mean  what's the alternative  Just go on and on feeling like that  Why go through it when there's hope that things can get better 
Currently in therapy  Still in the beginning of it all  Not sure what I should address in this type of situation with my therapist  Is there any sort of thing I should inquire about  
What    This sounds so weird  
If you change your lifestyle now it's completely reversible  Watch forks over knives  Do some research  Type 2 is usually hereditary and life style related  Many people can manage without insulin and a lot of illnesses can be prevented by taking care of yourself  
Yes but does it also maybe give people a chance to sort of wallow in negativity  which could be a bad thing  I've gotten worse since I started lurking here  most of that is because I've been dealing with some tough stuff but could part of it also be that reading this sub gives an unhealthy space to ruminate about how shitty my life is  Perhaps some of it also is opening up about your problems which could be constructive vs  just lurking which could be bad  Also I think it could be bad that we don't see many success stories  "I beat my depression" etc  here  I'm sure there are people who get help and get better  but that's mostly not this sub's audience  which could make things seem more hopeless than perhaps they are 
aw  that's awful  was the person who showed up nice at least  and did you have a good time with them 
I was really hoping today would be different   It wasn't 
Just did the same  Thanks for inspiring confidence 
i have felt exactly this  you describe it so well   one thing that helps me is to distinguish between sound sensitivity and the social anxiety associated with someone possibly being angry with you   sound sensitivity is that immediate pang of stress   it's pretty easy to self soothe it away once the stimulus is over   and during self soothing  i find i've also delayed the social anxiety and that feels like a big step in overcoming it too 
The new year and holidays really do that  What's up 
Great job  I'm trying to encourage a friend to do the same thing for her anxiety    Last year  I deleted instagram  I had a lot of difficulty getting over a break up last yeae  and because it's easier to control Facebook's content  I just decided to tweak my fb but delete instagram  I used to redownload it every now and then just to post something  but then I would delete it right after  But in all honesty  it feels so nice not to have so much social media hanging above your head  It feels nice to be able to let people know that social media and publicity doesn't rule my life 
Not latly for me  Weed tis nice but it can make things pretty bad if you use it in the wrong way like if you are anxios or just tô sad Its best tô avoid for me  
I relate 
A family member of mine just passed away because she didn't take care of her teeth for years  She got an infection and it got into her blood stream  So there are certainly serious reasons to stay on top of your dental hygiene  
You couldn't have described this any better  This is exactly me  especially at work  
I actually read somewhere recently that you can sign up for the Facebook messenger app even if you're not on Facebook  you just need a cellphone number  I mean  it won't be the disabled account  but you can still use the app 
I just had a moment  I had to talk to my dad about spending money on college apps and he got upset  I don't really like talking to my parents about things that I need help on  It makes me feel like a burden  and they don't really help when they make me feel bad about it  He said I should've told him even earlier and that he didn't even know what colleges I wanted to go to  It's not like they ever ask  or really show interest in what goes on in my life  I guess I should've told him earlier  but I didn't build up the courage to until now  Spending Christmas together didn't help at all  either  I didn't get anything besides one gift card for  50  Which is better than nothing  but I'm pretty sure the family dog got better things than I did  Maybe I'm just being greedy  I guess  I just wish overall they knew me  cared enough to know me  but they don't  I'm not saying I have a bad life  They take care of me  make sure my basic needs are met  send me to school  etc  I have friends and I'm not anti social or anything  I just wish someone would see me for me  I work really hard  or think I do  so someone would tell me for once they were proud of me  My dad asked for my report card after I told him about my fees  It had all A's except for one B   It always scares me to hand it over  I try to avoid it as long as I can  I burned a report card once just so I wouldn't have to show them  But it's not like my grades are ever bad  Almost always A's and a couple of B's except for two years when I went through a rough patch but even then I dropped down to two C's  But nothing's ever acceptable and I should always be better  He just looked at it and went "Okay " That was the same response I got when I managed to get all A's one time  It feels pretty crappy afterwards  To sum it up  I guess  I'm just a kid wanting approval and someone to listen    Sorry if that's all just a jumbled mess and if I just sound melodramatic  Just needed an outlet 
at the end of the day   it was me who had to persuade myself to delete FB  my mom tried telling me to delete it but it didnt work  give your buddy some time     and yeah i spent wayyyyy too much time on FB anyway  im so fuckin happy its outta my life
no problem bro  delete that shit
I read your post  thanks for it
You probably just deactivated it  The actual delete page is difficult to find  so you'll probably have to Google it  That's what I did when I deleted mine  It will deactivate initially but be permanently deleted after two weeks as long as you don't log in  I guess Facebook really doesn't want people to leave 
Thanks   it helps to know I'm not the only one    I've joined the gym to get to know a few more people  Think finding more hobbies will help  I guess time will tell  
I'm trying to get through a panic attack right now   I used to use Xanax for anxiety  but ended up getting addicted to it  Twice  So they won't prescribe me anymore  but I detoxed from it   My psychiatrist prescribed me Ativan instead  but I really try to get through the attacks on my own and will only use Ativan when I really really need it  when I start getting nauseous  light headed  cold sweats  etc    I guess my biggest victory recently is getting through and passing my public speaking class  My professor was incredibly encouraging and really believed in me  I did 6 speeches  one of which I gave a medical demonstration of a subcutaneous injection for the class     So I should definitely be proud of myself 
I cry at nearly anything these days  The slightest tone of disappointment or disapproval puts me on a new level though  I understand how you feel  
Sometimes I feel this way too      What I'm going through right now is emotional PTSD from a shitty relationship  I guess a part of me is still having trouble believing that I'm suffering from PTSD and that part of me says "dude  you're just going through a break up  you're not depressed  just get over it"  This part of me also says that other people have it worse and that I don't deserved to claim that I have depression   This is gonna sound weird  but what has really helped me accept my circumstances is the movie "inside  out" I think it's the most accurate way to describe depression  Tl dr  inside out shows that we can feel helpless when something of value to us  suddenly feels like it doesn't exist anymore   i e  if family is important to us  but maybe our family is going through a tough time  we can feel helpless and this depression   
Please   whatever you do do not commit suicide    Please message me if you need to   This feeling sucks since u relate we can relate on that  But do not commit suicide please for the sake of your family's feelings but I definitely know what you mean but I couldn't do that either knowing it would kill them inside 
I know this is months late  but those drugs are dopamine agonists  They've been known to trigger compulsions in people who have never had them before  Sex  gambling  shopping  drugs  all become potentially irresistible draws for some people on that class of medication 
I don't know about OP  but if that was an option for me  I don't think I'd worry about having depression anymore lol
Mention how the thoughts are obsessive to you  A lot of phobias fears associated with anxiety can become OCD in nature  so treating the obsession and any compulsive behaviors you might have when you have those thoughts can be helpful to you  Also  as a mother I would bring up concerns you ay have with parenting and your fear obsession being picked up by your daughter  as that seems to be a concern of yours as well  Also  I would keep a journal where you write your concerns for your therapist  This is something I try to do  For example  a thought that does sit right  or a moment where maybe you tried a coping mechanism and it didn't work  bringing up these concerns to your therapist will help with the smaller  day to day anxiety you may not be picking up on as much 
Same  you can pm me if you want  I would like to talk to someone else going through chronic depression too

It kinda mellows down when you realize that time is sort of a social construct and a year's transition to another is similar to a week's  with its respective implications regarding the responsibility of bettering your own life   I say so because I feel the same as you 
Someone finally said it   Experience Project was a nice option for me and a lot of people  Unfortunately  it got closed down  
Thanks for reminding me  I was gonna do that after I graduated and didn't need messenger anymore or as often 
No  Thank you for being that guy  seriously    I'd rather learn than not  Happy New Year to you too 
Thank you  I appreciate it 
Telll a doctor your depresseds  Some people find SSRIs helpful  they never did much foe me   wellbutrin was the only antidepressant that ever worked for me  I find CBD helps me too 
Same  Wanna make a pact  Am serious
Who told you not to use the bathroom  Why did they say that   The brain is powerful  Anxiety is conniving  It sneaks lies in and our brains often believe those lies  It's well known that anxiety can cause physical symptoms  If you question your thoughts you'll often find your anxieties to be irrational and illogical  No shame in that  I've fallen down that trap myself 
They don't know what they are missing  Hope you are having a great party    
Okay brother  Thanks for your concern    
no problemo  you wont regret it  btw  if you still might need messenger  make an extra account and add the people you might need to message  then download the messenger app on ur phone  
Rejection always hurts  but it's better to have told her  Now you know she's thinking of other people  you aren't wasting time swooning over something unattainable  
If there was ever a post to describe my depression  this would be it  I have friends that are so much worse off than me  yet I have the nerve to say I'm depressed  I'm sorry  I wish there was some way I could help  I know saying "I know how you feel" doesn't help  but  Idk   I'm sorry for your situation 
same
I actually did the same about a week or so ago  unfortunately the reaction was quite different  My father left the room  I think that he just doesn't know how to handle this kind of situation   and my mother seemed to be annoyed with me  saying that I have no reason to be depressed  Moving on  I am glad that your parents are supportive of you  and good luck with your future  Happy new year   
not been online for 2 years but it cause i forgot my password email ugh
I was so crippled with guilt that i thought the only way i could escape it was suicide  I was so anxious and I would just keep confessing but everytime the guilt just kept on coming back  One morning it was just so bad i just looked up obsessive guilt on youtube  this was before i even knew what OCD was  and found this video   https   www youtube com watch v vjRjaTA2bD8  Completely changed everything  I occasionally get guilty but i am much better at identifying obsessive thoughts 
every birthday of mine
havent since i was 11 or 12
Don't worry I have changed since high school as well  I also get told the same stuff you hear as well  At this point  I don't care since I am at peace being alone  It's hard for people to fathom that someone enjoys being alone 24 7  but that's who I am not sorry for it  Depression is clearly causing you to change and with every mental illness  it only gets worse as you get older  
no
sad tbh
Oh I was thinking more along the lines if there's anything your boyfriend can do to help you  Have you thought about taking anti depressants  
Tell you what  You pay for me to fix my teeth and I'll take better care of them  Deal 
Nice I think I'm gonna do that too
Man I relate to this so much it's crazy  I'm just stuck in a hole right now  Feel like there's nothing I can do or want to do
 removed 
Thank you for replying  I didn't think of it that way 
yea pretty much
But time isn't a social construct  its very real and its always moving forward 
You can talk to me but I'm gonna fall asleep soon D 
I started facebook over the summer hoping I might be able to stay in touch with friends from high school  graduated in the spring   Nope  Not sure what good I thought it'd do  or why I'm still there 
I'm facing a similar situation  Your post has helped to calm my nerves  Than you  
I know how you feel and I'm sorry you have to go through that  What usually help me calm down is one thing my therapist taught me to do where you essentially just keep asking yourself "and then hat " Until you realize that the worst case scenario of what you're afraid of isn't a bad a you thought it would be  For example  you are probably thinking to yourself "I'm going to contract ring worm " Then ask yourself  "and then what " "I go to the doctor and get medication " "And then what " "I get better "  I'm sure it's going to be more complicated than that in your mind but I just wanted to illustrate it for you   I hope this helps you  
No problem  same shits been happening to me for last 3 months before I let go  If I had 3 months ago  I would've been much better off today  
 removed 
Try to go for a new hobby  Maybe a simple one like drawing
The worst it ever got for me was when I was suffering with POCD  I felt so physically ill that I basically just slept for 3 days pretending to be sick so I wouldn't have to tell anyone what I was feeling  I eventually "confessed"the things that my mind made up about me and that helped me get better for awhile even though it I technically a compulsion  
I have this problem aswell so I tried finding movies or series where the characters doesnt have good careers etc     Im currently watching  Flash  Arrow  Person of interest and Touch if you're interested    I cant say for sure that this will help but it has for me so I thought I would share  
As someone who is also in high school and depressed I'm really holding out until college  I'm going through the roughest time right now but I have hope that college will change things for me 
I usually get concerned and think for hours if it was my fault or theirs  and how much fault we share  and i weight various different possibilities  then i'll either forget about it or i'll do something stupid to defend myself because I think the person has made a permanent decision to hate me  Very problematic depending on the relationship type  the more affect they can have on my life  the more defensive I get    I think  hmmm   i have a problem   but not really  cunt's shouldnt be talkin shit if they dont want to deal with the wrath  i come on so strong and fast I scare myself  but it's all logical when you consider the 30 different factors  which no one ever does but me   
That's how I feel  especially since I'm in high school  feeling invisible is so painful  That's why I decided to go to every club meetings as many as I can this year because then people would notice that I exist   But I'm still not satisfied  I still feel invisible  No one wants to be friends with me unless I completely open up and throw myself at them and that's when they barely start noticing me  This year wasn't all that bad  I made 3 good friends and that's amazing considering I've never had any good friends  But still  I keep thinking that even if I don't exist  my friends can probably live without me and the thought of it makes me die inside  I'm not that important and I'll never be  I'm never going to be important enough to be a part of anything 
I wouldn't stay friends with her  because jealousy will arise when she's dating other people  And let me guess  you don't think you can get someone you like as much as her  Alright  let's just say chances are you won't right now  You can always change  but it's hard to change when you're depressed  By the way  what exact words did you tell her when you said you had feelings for her 
I don't want you to kill anyone  Just saying  Including you  of course  but that's for you to say  not for you to say for someone else      sorry if this was a joke but it's a dark one and I think we're all a little on edge here 
Why 
Perhaps because they care  Perhaps because it makes them feel better about themselves  and means they can ignore your problems needs  Hard to guess without context  
Sometimes it helps to have a private fb account just for yourself and for the groups you like  memes   humor      That's what I use it for 
Don't worry about the future man  it'll take care of itself 
This is what I immediately thought of reading your post    https   m youtube com watch v zCqA5Ua3OVA   it just sounds to me like you are no longer as scared of these thoughts as you used to be  Don't worry  I am positive you have no desire to act on them 
Did they RSVP    
Only one person showed up and the dude is clearly not happy about it  saying stuff like "they don't know what they are missing" just make you sound unrelatable  I know you mean well and my goal isn't to make you feel bad  but  statements like that can seem really out of touch with reality  
Sorry this is so late  and I apologize but I don't have any advice to give you just yet  but I can relate   I am 24 and was abused by my older brother when i was 8 9ish  memory is still a little fuzzy    I didn't remember my abuse until recently  but I have been living with my brother for the past 2 years since I moved back home after college and it has been an absolute mess   It's at a point where we basically don't ever talk because when we do  he becomes incredibly cruel   I've been making efforts to move out this summer now that I finally have a real job and will be done with my Master's degree by then  but I've spent plenty of nights crying because I'm beginning to realize that I probably won't have any relationship with my brother once I do   It makes me sad to think that once my parents are gone  he's the only family I'll have left  but he can't stand the sight of me   I guess my face has just become a constant reminder of what he did and he can't handle the guilt   I've spoken to my parents about it and we are discussing the potential of confronting him about it  but I doubt it will make a difference   If anything changes and we somehow work it out  I'll be sure to send a happier update your way   I truly hope things work out for you 
I've confessed to friends 3 times so far in my life and got rejected every single time  but even though I'm still friends with them  things have become different and I often feel like I ruined our friendship by telling them  I think it's best to tell them though
Definitely look for support groups  Sometimes they're hard to find  especially if you already said there is no DBSA in your area  NAMI is another national resource group  Most of my friends have mental disorders  everyone in my close group  including my boyfriend   but that was more by chance and crazy people tend to group together  Sometimes it's easy to tell if someone has a mental disorder  You can always try clubs in your college  I know mine has psychology clubs and creative writing  Both tend to have those type of people in them  and I'd definitely say the majority would at least understand it well  Try finding stuff like that that you take interest in and make friends  There's some force that groups us together  When we meet someone else with a disorder  even if you don't know  there's a connection that usually forms 
I was thinking of taking a break from being friends just to sort myself out  You pretty much hit the nail on the head  Something like this  "Hey  I really love spending time with you and Im starting to have feelings for you beyond friendship  I hope you might feel the same way too  and Id like to take you out on a proper date  
I have met some of the wealthiest people in the world who feel empty inside  There is no shame in that   Look at Kate Winslet in Titanic   No one would blame her for being depressed    
If you don't mind me asking  Were they your friend before you asked 
Guys  I feel like when I'm busy  I feel fine  But during the school break  I feel very depressed  And when I express myself to people  they always says things to temporarily relieve my depression like exercising or having a positive mindset   I've been thinking that life is meaningless  I used to feel that family  friends  love  and passion are all meaningful  But  in the end  everything is meaningless  Am I right  Or What is the ultimate meaning  I keep coming back to this question for 2 years  I can feel for a several months  but then  I get back to the same situation  Questioning my own existence and meaning  
I thought i had it rough getting choked out by someone i let in my apartment    Stay strong 
Same here  I kind of got used to not celebrating anything really  
This is kinda different than what all the previous comments say  but podcasts are a good way to zone out and entertain yourself  They don't have all the perfection of tv  Joe Rogan Experience  Welcome to Night Vale  No Sleep  which is based off the subreddit  are a few that I listen to  You can listen to them while driving or exercising  There's bound to be some about what you like  Same thing with audio books  They've helped me out and when I went a while without listening to any  everything got worse    Just a suggestion  Hope it helps 
I'm sorry it is a pretty tough pill to swallow  She really is a great friend and I hope I'd be able to remain friends with her at some point  Yeah I'm happy I worked up the nerve to tell her  but I should've prepped more for the aftermath 
If you are looking for something that allows you to rest  I recommend watching indie movies  where there's actually emotional depth   or watching comedy  or humor for some laughs   If you like something more pro active  I'd suggest baking   Baking is the best   You can't go wrong when cookies and cake are the end result of what you're creating     And  also crafts   Sometimes building something  or putting something together really helps   I used to make candles and a friend of mine used to put small car models together   Can be a super fun distraction        Also  puzzles  Fun ones     Or  playing with a pet if you  or your neighbor's got one 
There with you buddy  Had to work from 10am 10pm today at a major worldwide convenience chain store  First shift was fine because I had help  but it was slow anyways since everyone is still hungover or asleep  Once they left at 4  someone else was supposed to come in  and because it was so busy before they left  I figured i'd hold my excruciatingly painful shit I've now gotten from drinking milk a day away from spoling  No one came because "oh I'm not coming in anymore" happened and I can't lock the door to halt business        Not to mention my store was robbed a few weeks ago  with me being the victim  So a sketchy guy passes by the store a few times to peek in from across the street  only approaching if he "thinks" im in there alone  only to have a customer out of view talking to me     Now I have to worry about possibly getting robbed     again    Fast forward to the end of the shift  I finally get off and get home  only to fuck up the side of my car on the neighbor's car  There's still so much shit wrong with me just like everyone else like romance failures and blah blah blah  I'm at the point where any emotion brings a tear at this moment  Fuck this year already 
It's been helpful for my depression  not a miracle but helpful   but the downside is my practictioner is convinced I'm bipolar now and dismisses any time I make her uncomfortable as "mania "  This is literally the only practitioner I've had in 13 years to react this way  she also doubts I have autism    and I am trying to change her but waiting lists are long   
For 4 or 5 years  and we still are great friends  
Would you like to talk to me  I won't go anywhere  
It's funny i just realized  I never even look at the top or hot posts  Just go straight to new 
She cares about you 
Been spending NYE alone for a few years now and I hate December more than anything  There is too much happiness around for me to process  Been alone for my whole life so i can't imagine a life without being alone  I know the feeling to shut everyone so no one will constantly feel sorry for you  
Are we twins   I also have to keep constantly reminding myself that people's emotional states are nothing to do with me  but it can be very hard  especially when your jerkbrain is telling you that all your friends hate you  
I have nothing to offer except the knowledge that you aren't alone  At times  immediately after sex I want to cry  I feel sick   We've been married for 7 years   Best I can say is talk to your therapist  Keep working through it
Hey happy new year   I don't have many friends at university either  but I personally prefer it that way  I am singularly focused on my studies and not beholden to anyone  I'm free in a way that most people aren't  
I just feel like dying all the time now   It used to be every once in a while  but now it's been constant for weeks and I just don't have the drive to keep going
Other then the strict relationship that comes with a patient to doctor sort of thing  I've given her no reason to 
 hugs  
Ha  I just did that so I can find it at a later point when I want to read it
I can't really help you because I feel exactly the same 
I pretty much categorically refuse to watch movies for this very reason  They're basically two hour commercials full of attractive people whose sole purpose in life is to make you feel like shit so you'll buy shit to dispel the feeling  The only TV shows that don't make me feel like an ugly loser are funny cartoons like Rick and Morty or Futurama   I'm sorry you feel similarly  I hope you can find peace 
Wow that really sucks  
You were sexually assaulted   I'm sorry that this happened to you  It was not your fault and this is not normal behavior for an 11 year old 
Wait I thought it is releasing in februari tho  Also you are in for some fun then I really like how zoom is introduced but I won't spoil anything   
No means no  And you never have him consent to do any of those things to you  I was in an abusive relationship once and one of the signs is a forceful hickey  I'm glad you're away from this lunatic  Have your guard up and have a plan in case he shows up  Make it clear that contact is not wanted  this may be difficult if you still work together    
I'm lucky my momg was there for me  I also have a kid so I know what you mean
That's a good idea  thanks
I'm glad to hear you two are still great friends  Did you take or break or anything after you had told her 
Help comes in different forms  I think  I always got the sense that this place is more for peer support  for people to relate to one another rather than to receive platitudes from atop someone's high horse  I think a lot of people here aren't even depressed  but just come here to spew empty rhetoric about therapy so they can pat themselves on the back for trying to be helpful  But they really do more harm than good 
I guess I was sort of looking for answers  Typing this up really helped honestly  Any coping strategy's in dealing with OCD and Hocd and the like  any advice would sort of be appreciated  but typing up this post really helped honestly 
I have cured from severe depression  but I was diagnosed with anxiety and panic disorders  I wouldn't have been able to cure from depression without my medication  and I managed to stop taking them   Recently I started to feel like I'm not happy anymore although everything is fine in my life  so I started to take meds for my anxiety two weeks ago  and already now I feel so much different  It's like I got a kick to my ass so that I'm able to see how things are in reality   I know many people are against meds in mental health issues  but the truth is  sometimes you just need them  For example in my case  I've accepted that I have anxiety probably my whole life  so I will continue using the meds as long as I need   Stay strong  
Wow that sounds really nice  I'm happy you were able to have a good experience with that   If you don't mind me asking what were you using at the time   Drugs have always been a double edged sword for me  even last night at a NYE party I had about six drinks  which I never do anymore  and was left with pretty bad anxiety earlier today   The way you described taking them is actually very in line with how I think they would best be used   A means to getting a foot in the door and establishing comfort  and then hopefully you won't need the drug after that first push 
I would expect better advice from you mate  Everything was working out  at least what I thought  now I am back at that point again  Whatever I do helps me temporarily then I am back to square one  I think I should just kill myself  
We didn't talk about it for a few days  then we just got together  talked it through  and I said "I was over it too" when in reality I took 3 months getting over it  If I would've skipped those 3 months  I'd be much better off  In hindsight there's no reason I shouldn't have dropped it  except I was being selfish and wanted her  
It also depends on her whether remaining friends will work out or not  Some people are cool with knowing someone likes them and others will feel awkward about it and avoid them
Music for sure 
I understand this feeling completely  Both my parents are difficult in different ways  my father has a way of starting debates and then making you feel like your opinion isn't wanted  and my mother feels attacked and  gets hysterical at the smallest inconvenience  I feel like I only truly began to understand my anxiety until I moved back home for a bit after college  I had never realized before that in my home I live in constant fear of setting off my mother's yelling or one of my dad's one sided "political discussions "   I don't know how to feel about this  I love them both and appreciate all that they have done and still do for me  but the fact that they and their inability to deal with their anger molded me into the emotional wreck I am fills me with so much anger sometimes  It makes me sad that I can't wait to get out from under their roof 
My dad passed away on November 21st  and before that I was clinically diagnosed with atypical depression and anxiety  but I refused to take medication for it  I always think I have some sort of back pain or illness that isn't actually "real"  at least to the doctors  but to me it's very real   My dad's death has amplified it by 100000 and now I don't have a job and I don't start school until next fall  I know how you feel  very deeply  All I can say is that whatever you feeling may not be real to a doctor or a family member  but it is very real to you and that's all that matters   I would suggest going to a doctor if you can and really pushing the issue  I never did that and now I'm really paying for it  You could also be grieving and that's adding to it as well  but for good measure I would say go and seek help if you can  and really take care of yourself  
Better than just letting yourself drift away from friends forever like me  Let them in
Deleted mine a couple months ago  Glad to have that huge chunk of negativity gone  Too bad I can't "delete" all the bad shit in my head   
I felt good for the first time in a while having 2 weeks off school for break and now I think I've crashed lower than I thought I was going to  I hate school so much  Its a main trigger of stress for me and it makes it so hard 
You will push every single friend you have away if you keep doing this I can guarantee  They cannot help you  only you can do that for yourself  Have you thought of seeing a therapist  
let me know if you find a way   i just kind of fell into my first normal relationship ever and in the middle of being with him  i had a panic attack and bawled my eyes out for no reason  i'm terrified it will happen again and am sort of avoiding getting into that situation again  
This happens to me  often  I can't really give you advice  I'm in therapy to help me process  I like sex still so I'm not going to stop doing that  and I try my best to communicate with my partner when I'm triggered  It's never perfect  but we make it work  and I don't develop resentment as i had in past relationships  where I didn't communicate  Those times  I felt like i was reliving my trauma  and I couldn't tell if I was being hurt and used again  or if I was being loved and appreciated  So i talk  and talk  and talk  and it helps  I feel accepted and loved  he understands  and listens to me    You're not alone in this  Just know that you deserve someone who will walk through this with you  someone who loves you  and you'll get through it  And therapy  Therapy is essential    I don't know why you get it after climax  For me  when I'm at that point  orgasm I mean  I can sometimes feel super vulnerable  raw and exposed  That can trigger me  or something during climax triggers me and that's the result  I don't know if it ever goes away  but it helps that I feel safe and accepted by the person I'm with when it does happen  I know I'll get through it  and I have hope that it will get easier  
I also feel as if I'm the wrong sex  Like every day
It's been a few days and we've spoken a few time since  I know it's early  but she didn't seem awkward during that time

I work 72 hours a week and go to school for another 18 because like you said I'm perfectly fine when I'm busy but I can't stand being alone with nothing to do and no one to talk to
I'm 29 years old and I've been looking for "my people" all my life  I guess what that means is people who would have my back like I'd have theirs  that would accept me  and that wouldn't leave  I haven't found one  Maybe I'm in the wrong town but unfortunately it takes money to leave  I'm sort of finding those people on the internet  They aren't always the same people but they are people who get it and more often than not  those people are in this sub   Hopefully you find some of your people here too  
Two days ago I ate one protein bar for the whole day  I literally forgot to eat and didn't feel hungry  and woke up super hungry  0 10 experience
Do you think I should try talking to my school counsellor   currently in 7th grade 
I understand how you're feeling  I have anxiety disorder and my bf broke up with me last week  so I'm having this annoying and pressuring feeling in my chest all the time  like as if I was on the verge of a panic attack   I also started medication for panic and anxiety disorder two weeks ago  so it has helped me in surviving  But the main trick I have learned when I went to therapy is that you should just not be afraid of the feeling  and you know you're gonna survive  The feeling is the worst  but it's gonna go away  I have also problems with my heart rate  I've noticed that my rest heart rate is high af  so it makes it even more difficult to get rid of the feeling  and if I understood right  you have the same   Anyway  I'm here so if you want support or to talk about this more  let me know    
I get that  but she is one of my best friends so she knows I care about her  Thanks for the advice I'll definitely look into meetup com  I know you're not trying to put me down some things just need to be said a certain way 
I have health anxiety as well and knowing that someone else does has the same symptoms in a way can be reassuring  I get cramping on my left chest side  It's close to my heart so I get scared that it is my heart  even though I know it isn't  I've gotten better as of late in controlling the nervous and anxious feeling but I'm still constantly checking my pulse  It's become a habit  Usually it's normal and I can relax  but it's something I do a lot  Sometimes I cannot control the anxious feeling and I freak out big time  usually because I'll get a pain in my chest or around my heart  For some reason my main concern is my heart because I get an idea in my head that it'll suddenly stop beating or something  I'm only 21 so I know that is ridiculous but the possibility overwhelms me  But as of now I've gotten a lot better  Seriously  I know it's cliche advice  but the best thing to think is "if something was going to happen to me  it would have already happened"
I just want to say your post inspired me to make an account and start posting here  Hopefully it helps me out some to get my thoughts out of my own head  Also  fuck your roommates and their sorry friends  At least you aren't them  getting pleasure out of meanness 
Try meeting people online  safely of course  and chatting  I personally cope by daydreaming
Hug
Do what you love
Whoa  TIL I might have been autistic and bipolar the whole time  Yeah this used to happen to me a lot  I'm trying to reproduce  so I need to figure out what to do  It's almost unthinkable  how I'd manage it  When it happens  not if    Sorry I can't help  Just good to have someone to compare data with     
My parents actually put me into a computer and addictions program at a mental health hospital  My counsellor has determined that my depression itself is obviously more of a priority than how I cope with it  Getting off the computer won't instantly cute me of being depressed  contrary to what my parents had hoped 
I've actually dealt with this after a night terror  not just a nightmare    I came back with a clean ECG and diagnosis of a panic attack  The vertigo instability however could be the sign of an inner ear problem
Definitely just try to stay by his side  My boyfriend left me last week because he said that I need some time to take care of my anxiety issues I have panic and anxiety disorders   and I can tell you  it's not making this any easier  Of course I'm doing progress but still not having him with me makes me feel like shit   Not to mention we're still going on a booked holiday in a week    Anyway  I know it feels like shit to have problems like your bf does and it's normal that he is maybe pushing you away a bit  And that feels even worse to you  Trust me  he doesn't want to stay away from you  he's probably just trying to protect you  So if you only can  just maybe try to make him seek professional help and stay by his side   I would give anything to still have my bf on my side  so do your best in this  I know it's worth it  Stay strong   3
10 years ago  I am 28  I was popular  outgoing   but almost all my friendships were superficial  Parties  etc     I only connected with maybe 2 people on a deeper level  Never had much in common even then except back then I partied and was extroverted 
Yes  this  Bravo    OP  keep telling yourself things like this   "If I feel too sick at work I can always go home "  This is true  usually    "I think I'm going to hurl" usually makes a manager reconsider whether you should be at work  even in the shittiest low wage jobs    Every time I have done this  meaning  said this to myself  I have gone to work  then weirdly found myself able to stick it through  even when I thought there was no WAY I could  It is a surprisingly effective tactic   They also say when you are hung over  you should just get up instead of trying to rest  although every bone in your body is telling you you NEED to rest to recover    People say you should get up and go running  or whatever  Well fuck that    but getting up at all is enormously helpful  again  surprisingly   I didn't believe it  I was shocked  but pleased  by the results  I don't understand why  when you have poisoned yourself and need to rest like mad  getting up HELPS  But I swear it does   But you might have been talking about depression and getting out of bed   Well I have experienced both depression to the point of not being able to get out of bed  and hangovers to the same point  and similar advice holds true in both cases  weirdly   If I STAY in bed  whether from hangover  depression  or both  I think I'm going to "sleep myself better" but in fact it never fucking happens  So I have to admit   after years of this shit   that I am wrong 
Please also go for a dental checkup  Even if you think your teeth might be fine they might not be and there may be tartar buildup which is easily removed as well as other problems  Once your dentist give you the green light you will have a fresh breath and smile you can be proud of  Well done on your achievement so far 
Doing good and not good  I have panic and anxiety disorders and I had to start taking meds for them two weeks ago  My bf left me because of my problems saying that I need time for myself  We have a booked holiday in a week and we're going there  Doing progress with my problems but can't stop thinking about him 
Thanks  I always say I want to go back to my home planet  Idk if my people are on this one 
Same  I feel sad and like I want to cry there on the spot when someone uses an extremely assertive voice  They're not yelling but they sound so serious  idk why it makes me scared and sad but it just does  
Do you have any history of abusive relationships   Not just romantic  but family  friends  etc    My mom always yelled at me and I've always felt traumatized by it  even when other people are yelling and I'm not even involved 
I'm having those same feelings right now  While I'd like to keep in contact and hang out with her  It may be better for me to just take a break from our friendship 
Hey mate  I understand the dreadful conflict between living in a life that most others would consider to be wonderful  and I'm sure it is wonderful for you  but still feel as though you're staring into the abyss  You seem like an intelligent and articulate person  so I'm sure you've realised the following  but I know the power of having someone tell you things that you already subconsciously know  Depression is not necessarily a reaction to things that are happening around us  but rather something that we are have  Certainly for myself I've found that after many years of trying to eradicate my depression I've realised it's something that simply needs to be managed   I understand how you and your wife may be drifting apart  similar things have happened with my relationships in the past  mostly because my partner couldn't understand why I claimed to be so happy with them and yet be so very depressed at the same time  It was too difficult to comprehend that quite often the happiest times I had coincided with my blackest moments  because I felt terrible guilt at being depressed even when things were going well    Does the loneliness really bother you  And are you more extroverted or introverted   And  dude  normal  What the hell is normal  If normal is having loads of people that you call 'friend' but probably wouldn't cross the road to save then I don't want to be normal  It's all semantics  The same goes for being better  You have to decide what those goals are  Being better and normal for me might be to make carpets out of my own hair  Is that what you're looking for      As for the suicidal thoughts   I've also had many  I still do   feel free to PM me if you want to know some of the darker thoughts I've had in this regard    I can't legitimately help with trying to avoid those  I know it's dramatic but you can always try  r SuicideWatch  A lot of the posts are pretty severe  but there are also lots of people there who will help   I know I'm not giving you any real solutions here mate  I just hope my response helps a little

Personally that is the reason why I have gravitated so much to depressing stories  If you want something good I would recommend a manga called Oyasumi Punpun  Its depressing as hell but for some weird reason it made me feel a little bit better inside  and reminded me that i'm not the only one trying to survive in a world that makes no sense 
Thanks   I'd wait because I don't want to make a heat of the moment decision   I want to make sure I've been feeling this way consistently   I do sincerely want to get better  though I'm not always sure that's possible   I do want a meaningful reason to live   The issue is that what constitues a meaningful reason to live changes   When I'm in a depressive phase there might not be anything that really suffices   I might keep a log of my up down time to compare   There's still a chance things might get better  that I might be able to afford help  that I may overcome something   Even today I've been so despondant that I was crying and then fairly happy as I was talking to a friend   There's at least a few people who would be sad if I left  and I don't want to hurt them   I would just fake my death as an "accident" so as not to make them think  but there's a specific way I really want to go  if I decide to   I'd leave a video on a USB as my goodbye   Maybe a letter as well   It's not infrequent that I think of what I'd say   Anyway  aside from waiting for the life insurance clause to kick in  I want to give it at least a little while longer to continue to try and change course   I've held on for so long  I really don't want to go   But I need to do more than just hold on   That's the bear minimum  survival   I'd be "happy" even to be in a position like Dr  House  from the TV show   Brilliant  successful  able to do what he wants to  even if he is miserable    Only part of the way through  no spoilers please    I'd be satisfied to turn my coping mechanisms from depression  panic attacks and freezing up internally into depression and work ethic 
I was thinking the same things a lot today  Just when will the bad stop  If nothing good is coming  when will the bad stop  I don't have any illusions that someone will come into my life and "save" me  I'm really doubtful that I have it in me to save myself at this point  I wish there was some bright point in the future to hope for  but it's not there   I'm sorry that you're going through what you're going through and dealing with someone who abuses you  
Oh my god  your story sounds so similar to mine  I'm suffering from panic and anxiety disorders  I know  freaking amazing to have both sabotaging my progress    and they ruined the best relationship I've ever had  I know as well that "you should love yourself before loving others"  and I've always had problems with accepting myself  However that changed when I met this guy and everything was perfect  When time passed by I just started to  feel 'like I don't deserve anything and I'm such a waste of time for him   I started to feel better  and then I had a worse moment again due to the start of my meds and then my relationship with this guy was over  In a week we're going for a booked holiday together  Emotions   fucked up  Like you  I want him back but don't know what to do if it turns out he won't want to get back together with me  
It's nice to know that someone's  anyone really is  there to witness your thoughts  
Amen  I can't believe I managed to get through it 
I ended up with a few friends over for NYE   cheese was had  Then Jan 1  I had an asthma attack  Woo   Did you end up with YT or games  
I talked to my son yesterday  I said that bc he and I have not gotten along well and his game company is doing poorly so he has to go move back to his home state with his family so he can work on his problems  So far my son is most concerned for when my ex gets his cat back and not being able to play games with him anymore  I am hesitant on talking about hurt or safty as my son thought we were always safe and being 6  I still want him to believe that  Luckily my abuser was calculated when he was harmful and was safe around my son and my son only saw two bad arguments  and my son knew we have not gotten along well in months  so I think he understands more than i thought he would  I am just prepping myself for some tricky behavior and knowing I will need to be more patient with him 
Crossword puzzles  I am still the only person I know to play Pokémon Go  Read  Sudoku  Puzzles  Look at pictures of puppies or kittens  whatever floats your boat  
 Just because it started out shitty doesn't mean it is going to end shitty  Screw the person that rejected you  You deserve better than that and it just means that something better is coming  I struggle with social interactions too and New Years is a whole bundle of awkward  I try really really hard to believe that something better has to come    Most times it takes some real work to keep thinking that way but it might help you get through the rough start to this new year    Edit    Rewording what I said  
Welcome to Reddit 
I appreciate your post  I do realize depression isn't circumstantial  it just makes it more frustrating cause you're right   I feel guilty  The loneliness does bother me   but I don't know why  I've never been quite as alone as I am right now  Not working  having no one to speak to daily  not leaving the house  I only interact with my dogs  I am introverted though  I don't even like people really  I guess I just feel so alone that I'm desperate  And by normal I mostly just mean I want to be able to work  run errands  bathe regularly  not cry all day  
I've been experiencing this quite a bit recently  It's very hard to explain  but as someone else mentioned it's like your body is present but your mind is somewhere else  You sort of blink and realize you were not totally present  I didn't realize this was something one could experience with anxiety until I talked to someone about it  Seeing this post seems to help more as well  I hope it's helped you to see you aren't alone  
I feel for you man  I feel exactly like you feel  Happy new year  Cheers for making it through 2016  
This is neither an overreaction  nor a waste of time  Never forget that  What you are thinking and feeling is important to someone   even if you don't know it   You seem to have started halfway through your story here my friend  when did you start to have these thoughts or reactions  Try to not get frustrated about not knowing why you feel a certain way though  it can be totally normal for negative thoughts to arise for no particular reason   I can try help you directly though  I'm a teacher and if you'd like me to proofread your college essays I'd be more than happy to do that for you 
Maybe it is too hard to talk to your mom  I totally can relate but you should find someone to reach out to  It is hard to go through the lows alone and even having someone aware and checking in with you everyday or couple of days can be a big help   It could be a friend or cousin or teacher 
You can't really be sure if that won't change within the next few days  But isn't it also great to know that she really likes you as a person  It might not help about the feeling of rejection but you gotta see the positive aspects  You no longer need to hide your feelings too
Hey OP  I've been feeling some similar symptoms lately   that feeling that I'm always on edge and on the verge of a panic attack  I'm also experiencing some exciting and dramatic changes in my life  and perhaps these changes are what's causing the both of us to experience these anxiety symptoms  Breathing through it helps  and knowing that you are okay is a good thing to remind yourself of when things feel particularly heavy    just wanted to say I feel you  and you're not alone  
Find hobbies  then go to clubs  
Same here   
I used to be but I no longer have the will or desire to do anything  Things I used to enjoy  soccer  hiking  snowboarding  photography  reading  writing  I'm afraid to try to make friends again though because I don't want to get my hopes up
Hey there  just try to relax   I don't know about your boyfriend  his trip  or anything  But the fact is that he is going and you just have to try to accept it  I know it's not easy  Maybe try to talk with him about this  If he's a good guy he will make this as easy for you as possible   Where are you living  so is there a lot of time change between you two  I'm living in Finland and my ex once went for a training camp in Australia for three weeks  and I admit it was difficult  but we still managed to call at least once a day and then text whenever needed    Unfortunately  You cannot stress for things that will happen in the future  so you just have to live in the moment  I have anxiety and panic disorders so strong that I need to take meds   so I understand what it feels like when the other person is going far away   Yeah like I said  just talk with your boyfriend and I bet everything is gonna be fine  If you need someone to talk to  I'm here  All the best 
It's funny  I pretty much had the same conversation with a coworker recently  I'm a girl  he's a guy  I asked him out  We went on two dates but we didn't really mesh romantically like I thought we would  Things got awkward  We are not friends now either which is a shame  I feel like I ruined things  but I guess at least I know the truth  
Good for you  I just wanted to add something to your first goal  if I may    A while ago  I went to a psychologist for my anxiety   I was put on some medicine   it was absolutely dreadful   It made me feel like a zombie  I couldn't experience happiness or sadness  I was just floating through my day   nothing mattered  That is no way to live life  I was probably 13 at the time   I don't remember the medication name  unfortunately   They insisted that it was great for me to be drugged up   stoic 24 7  I ingested these medications for months until I put my foot down because I was tired of not feeling anything  Bizarre    Basically  what I'm getting at is please don't just take their word for it  You know how you feel more than your doctor does  Don't simply take anyone's word ever  not even mine  hah   Research the hell out of the meds before you take them  You want to know what you're putting in your body   how it might effect you  If you decide to take them  be objective  I hope everything works out in your favor     I wish you the best of luck  Happy New Year  Here's to getting over SA 
My computer is literally the first and last thing I see when I wake up and before I go to bed  That's depressing    I'm pretty sure I'm addicted  I almost wish my parents had never bought me a computer when I was 6 
Agmatine   Sarcosine are very interesting to me because they both activate AMPA via mTOR like Ketamine  I wish we knew what mechanism causes Ketamine to be far more rapid in its anti depressive effects  
I wanted to  but didn't get invited to anything  Even sent out a snap with weed  Eventually I just went to sleep since I had to work a long shift today 
Nice  I like to temporarily deactivate when I'm extra down  and usually reactivate once I'm in an upswing
I think this comes from expectations of some huge change that somehow "fixes" whatever is not how you want it to be  The crash is harder  Be good to yourself in any little way you can  Tomorrow is a new day  and so is the next  
Good for you  I wiped clean my Instagram and Facebook accounts  not just deactivate  but actually delete every post and photo  and it was the best I'd felt in weeks   I get all my memes from my Instagram  I just follow meme accounts and nobody else  and I make sure nobody who knows me IRL can find me  Maybe you can give that a try 
Rejection always sucks  Honestly there's millions of people in the world and some of us just aren't attracted to the people who are attracted to us unfortunately  It kind of makes me not trust myself or my judgement a bit when I like someone now  like there must be something off because I like them or that it would never have worked out anyway   But you should be proud of yourself  You told the truth   The other commenter was right though  If you truly have feelings for her  don't be her shoulder while she dates other people  You'll resent whoever she is with and perhaps come to resent her and you won't really be her true friend  And in that situation she will be either oblivious to your true feelings or lie to you to spare your feelings and not be a true friend to you   Take some time to let things cool off  Hopefully you can come out friends after  
Glad to hear you are getting some help    I am a teacher in Sweden  as the school is not aware of your situation  including health staff at the school  I would strongly advise that you get them in the loop  Maybe you could simply approach a teacher that you trust and explain  Perhaps just go for a quick visit to the school nurse simply to inform them  They will likely ask if you could get a diagnosis  but that is not a priority straight away     The reason for this is that they will be able to support you in school  and if your grades slip then they will know why  Because you are under 18 you will get a help much more easily  and they will be able to make concessions for you so long as it supports you as a student   The best way to deal with depression  especially being so young  is to get as broad a support network as you can  The school may be able to help you with your parents perception of your issues as well 
That's true I hope things don't change too much  It is which is why I wouldn't want things between us to become too awkward  Thanks for that I was completely missing that part of it  It does hurt like hell  but that weight is off my shoulders 
Well on facebook I just turned off notifications for each single person I know  so I only see memes  Hate seeing other people's lives but can't give up on memes  that's why I did that   suggest other people to turn off notifications too for other people so the memes can still live    
If you're in the US  check out your state's NAMI chapter   they're a great resource in general  and even if there isn't a support group in your area  they might have links to telecommute support groups 
Social media just makes me feel worse  I'd rather not know anything that's going on 
I don't think this is a place for the "normal people " as you call them  to come in on horseback and save the "helpless souls "  Rather  I think this is a place where people can relate to each other and support each other  or at least commiserate   But we shouldn't necessarily actively fuel each other's depression  which is what I see going on every now and then on this subreddit 
get off all of it  its all dumb  its all a vain attempt to be important  
After reading through your post  I really hope you can escape from your life and live however you want and wherever you want  It hurt my heart to see what you're going through  
The guilt is a killer  I don't connect with very many people  and not much makes me 'happy'  but my last girlfriend did in so many ways  And it absolutely killed me to see her struggle to understand why I was so depressed while telling her I was the happiest I've ever been  I don't think there's an easy fix for that  I'm introverted too  and I prefer being alone  and even though sometimes I feel like that loneliness is oppressive  for the most part I enjoy it  But if you do need that human contact it's hard to find because speaking to loads of people or trying to connect with lots of people is just too exhausting for us  My only advice is to pick your battles  find someone  even if it means waiting  that experiences the world a little like you do and try and connect with them  I have to admit  I laughed out loud at 'bathe daily' because I've had the EXACT argument with someone before   What are you going to do today  Nothing  Can you at least fucking shower for once    For me it's routine  Routine routine routine  Once I get into a routine of doing things I do them regardless of how I feel  The difficult thing is to get started  but one you do the whole process becomes so rote that your feelings don't factor into it 
Don't know if this will help you but whenever I think about these kinds of things I remind myself that the meaning of success isn't something that other people decide  Success isn't solely about money  nor is it about being in a relationship  Everyone has their own definition of Success  For me Success is finding someone who might be able to understand me  and being happy  If you don't know what you want that's fine  but just realize that you don't need to rush  just take it one step at a time  
the obvious thing here is that your friends are just really mean or idk just INcorrect
SMOKE POT DUDE  
I'm sorry about that    Glad you were able to let him know though  It is a shitty feeling which I can totally empathize with especially now  I hope you feel better  
I am not looking forward to finding a job after graduation  I am not looking forward to trying dating again  Both seem so daunting as I think of them  
I was the person who couldn't live without fb but I got rid of it a while back  I think before Thanksgiving  I don't think I ever want to reactivate it either  The only regret I have is not getting a few phone numbers from certain people first but oh well life is so much better without all that bs  
some people are reaching out and some people are bill boarding their problems just because  Most people don't know what they want  also  this is the internet     take that with a heavy chunk of digital salt 
I am very sorry for your loss  I can't imagine what it's like losing a father  I'd probably go nuts   Thanks for understanding me  I don't know anyone with the problems I have and I am ashamed of talking about it with anyone because they might think I'm a weirdo  But yeah "imaginary" illness I've been dealing my whole life  I realized tho that it happened a lot more frequently and more intense when I wasn't studying or working  Keeping my mind occupied is what keeps me sane I think  I'd tell you to get something to occupy yourself with  Especially if you're dealing with your fathers' passing   Thanks for taking the time of reading and replying to my post  I appreciate it   I'll wait till the morning and go to the doctor to see what they think 
I no longer feel the need to play music and I was in bands my whole life  I feel your pain  My advice is get 100  off the internet and go travel and tell NOBODY about it  
You don't have to compare you life to anyone else my friend  And you want to improve those specific things  Is there a reason for it  If not then why worry about them  I don't even know you  but you're clearly in pain  and you matter to me  So tell me  what are you interested in 
I get what you're saying  I already set that boundary the last time we spoke and I'm going to be taking a break from her  Thanks for the advice 
lol
I can relate to this too   I feel tired all the time and just want to sleep    
As a computer and internet addict myself I am torn between it and having a life  The computer is used as an escape  When I stop using it and stop using my phone and TV I literally don't know what do do with myself  I get bored and just patrol the house since sitting is boring and lying down I can only do for short periods since I can't sleep in the day  I know have 2 dogs that keep me entertained a bit but usually only to a point when I long to do something with myself   For many it may be a lifesaver however ultimately the computer TV drags me down further  It's like a lifeboat but with a hole in it  The computer TV locks my mind into a thought pattern that is not healthy since I am not aware and I am becoming less sentient  It's only when the eye fatigue kicks in and I am forced to stop using it due to the pain in my eyes  I then take a break but that only provides temporary relief as returning to my work or entertainment brings back the eye fatigue in minutes  A nights rest usually fixes it for a few hours  I have zero emotion left complete anhedonia and an very depressed  I am not suicidal though I don't see the point living like this either  During very bad spells I am unable to work and have to leave early or just stare all day at my screen  I fear I might lose my job as a result   The problem is that depression puts strain on the brain which is now very overworked from thinking  Bombarding it with flashing and changing TV content is allot for the brain to process not only while watching it but during your REM sleep and dreams as the brain tries to sort this backlog of information overload  That why depressed people sleep more and still feel tired all the time   The same applied to playing games  It's stressful on an overloaded overworked brain  And same for the internet  However the internet has other disadvantages  you can google your diseases sit on discussion forums or Reddit and get tons of misinformation or attempt to self diagnose which may make you worry more or increase emotion  I tend to google my meds and google alternatives to suggest and this has annoyed my psychiatrist as I come across as a know it all   But while the computer seems like a lifeboat since it's saving your life right now you cannot live in a lifeboat all your live  Eventually the lifeboat will sink as it is in my case  The solution is to make your rest of your life work  Since I have not been able to do that I can't advise on how  But people will generally recommend getting out more with friends and family  Exercising and getting out in nature  As well a following a healthy diet and addressing any shortcomings like Vit D or others and supplementing omega 3's  And getting a good nights sleep  Doing this as a depressed person seems like a mountain and it's hard or seemingly impossible to do all that at once   I was in a clinic once for 2 weeks where we were not allowed a computer or phone  We were giving access to the phone for one hour a day  There was a TV though I never watched it except for my last weekend  My eye fatigue significantly improved and I was forced to socialise and attend classes  Now it was probably a combination factor of the meds and the environment I was forced to make life changes including daily walks but at the end of 2 weeks I felt much better and ready to deal with life again  I tried to implement some of those changes in my everyday life but sadly within a month I started to relapse again 
Thank you for this  it started happening in sophomore year I think  I will definitely take you up on that offer if I ever finish writing my essays
All the time  Then when i stop responding to them they get all pissed off and act like its in my head
That happens to me  too  Specifically  the sound of an angry male voice really makes me sad  Even if they're not yelling at me  I really don't like it  
Thank you  people suck  but it's ok to treat yourself   
Hey  people are here for you my friend  Gonna send a longer message now  just want you to know I'm here 
You've described almost exactly what I've been feeling  I always thought she found me attractive maybe I just have shitty timing  Thanks it was a relief to put it out there  As hard as it may be I won't be  I appreciate you taking the time to write this  it really helps

Those high school animes where everyone has a ton of friends  several love interests  and goes out every day are especially depressing   I'm able to enjoy them for the escapism but I get deeply depressed when I'm done watching    I like stuff with relatable characters who have depression anxiety like NGE and Watamote   
If you believe stereotypes  American girls will like you because you're tall and you have an accent   If you have acne  it could be hormones and could go away  The weight thing  you could go to the gym or run or walk and do push ups and lose the weight or turn it into muscle mass  I don't see it happening if you don't even have the motivation to brush your teeth   I'm honestly not trying to be rude there  I only brushed my teeth today because I had to go to work    I too have gone to sleep after 5 am and woken up at 4 pm  I will say that going to the gym really helped me sleep at regular times  Well I fall asleep before the sun comes up anyway   I hope you find something that helps you  I'm still working on it clearly   If you have a friend that you feel you can trust  try and open up to them  It's scary but you'll have someone to talk to  Don't do the Facebook thing  It probably won't make you feel better  Honestly it's terrifying to me to imagine telling all my friends about how depressed I am  
You are normal if you have a wife 
Same   
Isn't it nice to know they want to see you at least  Makes me feel good 
For me the first time I went to my family Dr about it  she prescribed Cipralex   My anxiety eventually worsened and I was referred to a psychiatrist and for counseling   I have worked with a psychiatrist for years now  and have been discharged from therapy by my counselor   I would ask to be referred to a psychiatrist of possible  thus skipping the step of waiting for things to get potentially worse   You will most likely be prescribed drugs and I know everyone is different  but I know they have helped me immensely  You may need to try a few different ones to get the right one or mix for you    The best advice I can give is to be completely open and honest  and not hide anything due embarrassment     Good luck 
First off  You're not alone   in any regard  I've had suicidal thoughts for many years  some darker than others  and I've even hurt myself pretty bad  And through all those experiences I've learned that there are always people that will be there to try and help  Not fix   sometimes that's impossible   but always help  I think it's important for you to see a therapist  you need to try and find the root of these thoughts and treat them  If you focus on the depression surrounding the thoughts you never actually get to the point of preventing them  There is also  r SuicideWatch  loads of people there who have been through similar experiences and are willing to offer their help and support  But keep speaking to us if you want  we're all here for you 
I still don't quite understand it  Is it the same as "spacing out " That happens to me a lot  but I never feel like I'm watching myself  I just "wake up" and realize that I haven't been present  Scary enough  it especially happens when I'm driving  
I feel you man  Nobody believe I have anxiety or depression even though I've seen therapists in the past and have been diagnosed  I'm going through some stuff myself  but nobody hates you anxiety is a bitch like that  I used to have those bouts of numbness  What helped me is trying to take a moment to let me feel what's going on so that things don't build up  Hang in there man 
I would recommend checking out RAINN org or Pandora org  I know you say your Mom cant afford to support everyone if he goes to jail  but at the same time  does that mean he gets to keep abusing your sister  Is that the price to be paid to support the family  I know this is really really hard for you  You dont belong in the middle of this  Try talking to RAINN org and Pandora  Your sister will need help  The abuse has some serious impact on her  Not to mention any other kids are at risk  And I wouldnt be surprised if there were CP on the computer or somewhere in the house  Please check out those sites  Talk to someone anonymously there

God I know how you feel   
yeah like to the extent that people comment on it too  and in my head I'm screaming HOLY SHIT JUST STOP TALKING
That really sucks  I'm envious you're still in contact with people you've known since you were 5  That's amazing  Is there any part of your friendship with them that you still enjoy 
Also depression can mean different things to different people  Some people may only be depressed for a few months  others may have been for their whole life 
That doesnt really help  Trust me
Yep  We're definitely here with you  I've never had anxiety without the physical symptoms  Before  I think I had normal levels of anxiety  but this past year  something changed  I began feeling numbness and tingling in extremities  chest pains  headaches  lightheaded  nausea    It was a crazy year  But I've been meditating  and it's definitely helped with some of the physical symptoms  I'm more mindful of how I tense my muscles and clench my teeth  This sub has helped me tons  Welcome    We should also probably work on our sleep schedule  Lol
That sucks  People are so unreliable when it comes to going out I swear  
It's truly not fun
Hell yeah  go you  Online classes are great  
Facebook and snapchat kinda suck  they just make you feel worse  I'm still on instagram though cause on instagram there are so many accounts dedicated to mental health and they make me feel better in a way
Been there  and it went away  Best way to conqueror any form of anxiety is to just accept it or not care as much or separate it by labeling it as 'ocd not me'  not saying become gay  i'm saying 'oh if im gay then whatever' 
Depends  Events can cause depression  If you lose your SO  job and all your friends it could it you into a long term depression 
Stop watching mainstream hollywood crap and watch arthouse films  There are so many amazing movies out there    
I hate when that's what people say when you admit you want to die  that it's selfish  It's the most unhelpful shit  Please think of me and how I'd feel if you died feels more like a guilt trip than someone inviting you to stay and welcoming you to stay alive  It sucks that your friends weren't understanding considering they know where you're coming from  Maybe they're pissed because they know where you're coming from or because they don't know what to do for you   I hope you guys make up soon  
I'm sorry I didn't reply until now  I don't typically use this account  I'm not saying it's fine to stop exercising  just that the joy you can get from it is counteracted by the anxiety  about your appearance or performance   in my opinion 
I can relate completely  the internet  watching movies  playing games  anything that can be traced back to the net is my only relief  I went two weeks without the net a couple years ago and without I had a total mental breakdown  I stayed with my best mate the entire time cause he wanted to keep an eye on me and be there for me when I needed someone  But  without the net to distract from the world and my own thoughts I just completely fall apart  Not one single member of my family understands and that leads to stupid arguments  You are definitely right though  it should be listed as a legitimate source of relief for people suffering from depression  Addiction or not  the net is still the better option  
I don't think most people really want to hear a true answer  When I was at school  I was taught the correct greeting was "Hello  How are you" "I'm Good  how are you" "I'm good too"
That's the best reason to go      Also  sorry I'm not replying until now 
well everybody has social anxiety of some form even if you've gotten over the worst of it
Your roommates are fucking arseholes  Reading your post makes me want to throat punch them  although probably don't do that   Is there something you like to do  Favourite food  A walk around your city town  A massage  A movie  Happy birthday x
I completely agree  and want to add that I think the majority of people  do  get over it  because depression changes along with life  But most come here when they're feeling sad  and visit other places when they're happy   at least in my case  That's why I've begun going to  r wholesomememes  using my main account   and I've actually started feeling better    
Oh wow dude  what a turbulent time of your life  There's so much going on mentally physically socially   If you suffer from some form of depression then everything is going to be all the harder for you  I don't know you personally  but I know high school students  so maybe some of this applies to you but maybe not  I know that at your age you have a load of things going on outside of school   friendships  relationships  etc   and we seldom realise it but they drain a load of our energy  We have to direct our attention to so many different people we can't help but be exhausted  If you're extroverted that gives you a high  If you're introverted  like me  you fall into the void after a day of social interaction  So which ever you are  even before your job sport academics  you're mentally drained  And then of course you have everything else in your life  Including parents  who can really suck sometimes  I'm not suggesting in the least bit that you cut anything from your life  but pay close attention to how each of them make you feel  I'll use myself as an example here  I'd look at my life  realise that all the time I spent trying to socialise was tearing me apart because I just can't really connect with people and it was hurting me  It doesn't mean I'd cut that from my life  and at school that something you can't really do  but I'd try to manage it better  You see what I'm getting at   And if you want I'll look at your unfinished essays  Maybe I can give you some notes that will encourage you to complete them 
Wow I'm sorry you are going through this  he sounds like he's embarrassed and if he doesn't want to address the issue then oh well   "bring it up softly"  Sounds like something I have to do to get my bf to listen and understand me  I would definitely get some space for sure  there have been times where my man has gotten grabby and uses his body weight  bigger then me  to force himself on me  I don't like that or to be tickled  long story  but it wasn't until I freaked out and told him to stop did he listen  I survived sexual assault and I'm still kinda messed up when it comes to my sex life   he's patient but his dick is too important to him sometimes   if he gives me space I can eventually get intimate with him again but if he's being an asshole about it then I feel like when he touches me I'm being assaulted again  which in return freaks him out  But yeah it takes a while for my body to respond in a positive way when he touches me  if I'm not in the mood there is no way   at first I wasn't forceful when it came to my space but now I am and he got over it  Wish I can say my issues have gotten better but it's progress   I would talk to him when you are ready and tell him how you feel don't be afraid to get real with him  Explain to him you need to talk about what happened in order to move on in your relationship  If he loves you he will listen and do his best to make you feel comfortable again  Good luck  Hope this helps  
This is such a tough question for me  I don't want to feel embarrassed for truly saying how I feel  I'm lying if I say I'm fine  Cuz deep down I'm struggling and I just feel so hopeless that I can't find away out of this hole that I'm digging deeper and deeper  Life's confusing   
I always think of W B Yeats and how much he despised 'polite  meaningless words '  When I'm in a cavalier mood and someone asks me how I am I'll cheerfully say  'I'm good thanks  haven't cut myself once today '
Very true 
Keep exercising  read more  start with my hobbies again  try to limit my time on reddit   I've wanted to try meditation for some time now  Do you have any recommendations on where to start  Hope you'll achieve your goals  u VzVegeta   
I always just go for the generic enthusiastic 'Good  How 'bout you ' or something  I've noticed recently that I'm starting to sound more flat when I say it  even if I intend for it to sound peppy and lighthearted  
This isn't silly at all  You're feeling something extreme and you shouldn't hide that  What's your favourite film tv show book graphic novel 
It can be painful to pull the plug on a relationship in which one has a lot invested  but there are times when it's the wise thing to do  This  I believe  is one of them  A very good rule of life is that when people tell you  or show you  what they are  you ought to believe them  In this case your boyfriend showed you that he is not in control of himself at times  and when he is not in control of himself he is capable of committing serious criminal offences   He says that he "doesn't know what to tell you" and that "he doesn't know why he did what he did " I'm inclined to believe him about that too  It concerns me as much as anything else you've written here 
The best thing about this sub I feel  is the fact that there is always someone with something similar going on  someone to say  "hey  i legitimately understand how you're feeling  know what you're talking about " And that small connection can sometimes be the thing to make you keep going
Don't worry man  There are tons of us on the internet  Social anxiety makes communication so hard  its like no one else is on the same page because we're reading in between every line even when there's nothing there  The internet is a great place to practice expressing your ideas and not worrying about what people think  especially in places with anonymity like reddit 
You'll do fine  Rooting for you m8
Hows much does it cost if may ask 
It's a bit ironic 
My goal is to take therapy seriously and actually trying to connect with people  Isolating myself is only making me worse 
How did I get over it  I made lots more mistakes   I accepted that I was going to cringe a lot  but the more mistakes I made  the more I learnt and it got better
I feel like you read my mind and posted how I always feel  I relate to this so much  
I have this  too  I start shaking  my heart races  it's just awful  It doesn't even have to be flat out anger  it can just be strongly stated disagreement  Makes me feel like I'm so weak  
good luck dude  deep breaths and keep calm  depression and anxiety  Ain't nobody got time for that 
 HUGGGGGS 
What's up  You can dm me if you want 
There have been studies done  there's a direct correlation 
no one here cares about your humblebrag
What's going on  I'm more than happy to talk  using whatever method you like
I'm also 6'5  I could give you the perfect height hug  Can you get to South Africa 
I can keep it in check by talking with them on the phone  Try keeping in touch with them even if you are not able to be physically close to them   I still feel anxious when leaving them again  I am not sure if it is possible  for me at least to get rid of it completely 
thank you for your wishes  D
I appreciate your existence

I'm gonna do this  Thanks for the tip 
I have this problem too and I just try to distract myself until eventually I'm a tiny bit less miserable 
Probably not anytime soo lol
I wish I had cancer because it would give me an excuse to take a break from work and be miserable in bed like I already am  I've seen beautiful happy people get cancer and I can't help but think  why them  It could be someone who wastes their life away being depressed like me  They shouldn't have to deal with it when there's people like me who deserve it more 
Really  I will try to find it  I deleted my account that I already never used 3 or 4 years ago  I had to create another one months ago for a school project and I only used it once or twice  I now have an empty account with like 4 or 5 friends  
I can't pretend to know what you're going through  it seems like you've had to deal with a hell of a lot in a very short amount of time  I think it's going to be so important for you to find support  Not just friends and family but some therapeutic support  If it's enough to speak to people here then that's great but I think some professional practitioners are a really strong option  But you're not alone  In many respects you're not alone  
I've just come to accept and embrace it as part of my glorious awkwardness 
i stay on instagram too  i never use snapchat either 
What he did to you is awful and you should not feel ashamed or responsible in any way  You flirting with him does not give him the right to do what he did  It is a sexual assault  there is no other way to call it  You should be careful around this person  he could try you go even further without your consent  he has already proven so    Also  for future reference  I'd recommend you to be careful when sending nudes through Snapchat  There are ways to save the pictures without the sender knowing 
People are more than ignorant and rude honestly they forgot what respect means I fully agree with you 
right  i wish i got rid of it sooner  lmao i remember staying up all night before my birthday bc i was worried no one on FB would remember  i was such an addict  i feel wayy better tho  
I come here to read people's venting when I'm at my worst  That helps me get through these nights  So it is definitely something 
innit
Sometimes life's problems are the best motivators  Keep you head up buddy and look to the future with hope and ambition  
I am not able to exercise without music  do you run with music   Reading works for me  some times I have to read the same page multiple times  but after a while I am able to concentrate  After a couple of days my mind wanders less and less when reading   Videogames has also worked  though to a lesser extent 
I had a "friend" that would do this   I would text or IM them and unless it was something that they had an investment in  or benefited them directly  they just wouldn't respond   So  I deleted their number  deleted their contact and haven't been on any IM service in 6 months   So far they haven't noticed I haven't contacted them at all   So   yea   Guess I wasn't that important to them 
hahaha thats pretty smart bro   i think ima just subscribe to every decent meme subreddit cos im staying the fuck away from FB  
yup im staying on insta  recommend any good meme accounts on there  lol 
I know it's hard feeling like you cannot trust others  but all it takes is one good friend to forget about all the bad ones  
If sarcosine's mechanism is primarily through glycine transport inhibition resulting in glycine induced potentiation of AMPA receptor function  it's probably slow for analogous reasons to SSRIs  no   Maybe a strong glycine releasing agent  if such a thing is possible  would be more like MDMA instead of an SSRI in speed of antidepressant onset   https   www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles PMC5069295 
i wish there was a deactivate button on my feelings but nah cuz
Hey 
i was thinking that   but if it was just for memes n shit i dont think id use it anyway lol 
Well said
What does upregulate AMPAR mean exactly  Increase the amount of AMPAR receptors  How does sarcosine and lamictal do this   l theanine is ampar antagonist  and nmdar agonist  Would it be helpful synergistic with sarcosine lamictal or hurtful 
Moving is a tough transition  Your depression may be caused because you are leaving your comfort zone and fighting the move  Try seeing things differently 
Mel can I do that when I have 0 friends I can trust anymore 
If you don't find out how to do it just ask me in pm  just whenever you see anyone you don't want to see pop up on facebook  press that triangle thingy for a drop down menu and then click tap on "hide all posts from   " good luck    
Hi  Congratulations on making the decision to reach out for help  I made a list of the types of questions you would be asked by a doctor and therapist  I also recommend asking for a blood test to help rule out any potential factors contributing to the way you're feeling like thyroid issues  hormone imbalances  and vitamin deficiencies                                                                      If possible Before seeing a professional  I recommend writing down any symptoms you're experiencing along with context like a brief summary  It can be hard to just write without any direction  so hopefully the questions below can help give some guidance  You don't have to write down your answers to all of these questions  although you are certainly free to do that  Keep in mind that the professional just wants to get a clear picture of your life  so that they can give you the best care possible  Their intention is NOT to interrogate you and get you to confess a crime  They want to help you get better  and in order to do that  they need to know details about your life  When you're finished  consider bringing this paper and just show it to the professional  Here are the questions     what would you like help with  what are your symptoms  when did they first start  how long have they been going on for  how severe would you rate them on a scale of 1 10  how are your energy levels motivation  how is your appetite  how is your sleep quality and how much sleep do you get  have you lost interest in hobbies  do you isolate yourself from others  what is your school social work home life like  basically  the professionals want to know if your struggles are impacting different areas of your life and how much  For example  if you're in school and you're failing classes because you're depressed  it's important to say that you're failing classes   how is your ability to focus and retain information  do you think anything has contributed to the way you are feeling like the death of a loved one  how are your stress levels  do you have a family history of depression anxiety anything else  have you had any thoughts of ending your life and or harming yourself  have you harmed yourself or attempted suicide  do you experience racing thoughts  how would you describe your self esteem  do you feel nervous often  how would you describe your sex drive  none  low  medium  high    do you feel fatigued  how often do your symptoms occur  have you gained or lost weight recently  do you experience any body aches  do you feel like you move or talk slowly  do you ever feel hopeless and or like you've let yourself or others down  are you taking any medication and or supplements and what doses  do you consume any drugs in a recreational manner and if so  how much and how often  	 
I hate being asked that question too and always feel like I am lying when I say "good "  Eventually  you will see a day when you say "good" and actually mean it    Live for that day  
shit bro that's the dream  id like a magic wand too please  
in the subreddit  r getdisciplined  some wrote recently that all of this discipline advice boils down to 2 steps   1  Write down a Plan  2  Do it   So what's your plan s   Have you written them down  Posted them on a wall somewhere so you can check on them everyday  If you have a big plan  have you broken that plan down into smaller chunks   2011  2012  and 2013 were years of failure for me  3 years in a row  Just like you  Except that they weren't complete total fails  Nothing ever is a complete failure  It's only a failure if you fail to learn    In 2012  I made a 1 year and 5 year plan  I wrote down the biggest  grandest dreams that I thought would make me happy   Most of the things on my 1 year plan  I did not meet in 1 year  but after 3 years  I had actually accomplished most of them  Things that I didn't succeed at were either not really in my control  eg  Get married  or not concrete enough  eg  Invent stuff   Regarding your poor diet  one of the easiest things you can do is start drinking only water  Cut out all soda  juice  alcohol  coffee with cream and sugar  etc  I happen to like seltzer water a lot  It does 2 things for you  It drastically cuts down on a source of empty sugar calories and it keeps your palate clean of lingering flavors that tell you to go get another helping of whatever it was you were eating   Find a way to build exercise into your life 5 days a week  For me it was bike riding  I ride my bike everywhere  Automatic exercise  I always feel better on days that I ride   A friend of mine does yoga every day  It's part of her life  Another friend of mine works from home and takes a break every day by walking down to the corner store for a diet coke  The corner store is 10 minute walk away  20 minutes of walking every day for him  Build unavoidable exercise into your life  Also  get over to  r loseit if you want help with your weight   
It's greedy of who 
Thank you friend  Saying out loud can sometimes be the hardest part indeed 
Thank you   
trust me i did that on sooo many people lol
If you're convinced it's not psychological  why are you on the anxiety board     All symptoms you named can be caused psychosomatically  
yeah perhaps you're right actually  I guess it's pretty much like any other insult  not that being gay is bad but I guess it's super detrimental to me  and my mental health when I over analyze myself whether I am actually gay  It's like when someone calls you fat you're like "Whoa am I really fat"   But yeah I should be like "There's nothing wrong with it if I am"   Thanks for the comment anyway  I guess it's nice to know other people have gone through it and it's gone away 
I have like 20 friends on there and only recently started using it again for the depression and social anxiety support groups  
There are lots of people here who understand  Myself included  You aren't alone  I have the same thoughts and I fight them everyday  We just have to push ourselves harder than everyone else because they have it easy  
Before I got diagnosed with panic disorder  I was a 5 cups a day coffee drinker  But since then  caffeine has been my major trigger  Which sucks  because I fucking loved coffee  And yeah  even decaf triggered me  I'm a flavored water drinker now 
thanks for the support guys but there are also things that I didnt mention in the original statement  i pretty much had everything that any high school guy wants but now its all gone  friends  girlfriends  everything  
Some I follow that I like  braving  onthebookshelf  satansstarbucks  friedfluff  kttiens  owlturdcomix  Keep in mind that the more you follow  the more reposted memes you see  so you might have to shop around
Yeah I have been thinking of finding some sort of therapeutic support for a while now but I don't even know where to start  and therapy is looked down on in my family so I'd be alone on that one  But I do agree with you and thank you 
Have you tried listening to music when trying to sleep  When I am having trouble sleeping I listen to ambient psybient music  It helps me a lot  
I live in a family that yells all the time  Music helps a lot to distract the noise  
I feel you  As a result of similar circumstances  I'm also super sensitive to the tone of voice and can detect upset people a mile away  Thanks  mom 
Actually when you do the deep breathing you want to be aware of it filling up your lungs and exhaling its basically how meditation works  it also helps get your mind off the anxiety 
Then message boards like this will probably be the best start for you  there will always be people here to help  And I'm sure you are going to be strong for your family  no matter how broken you may feel  It takes a lot to be as open and vulnerable as you have been here  so I'm sure that bravery translates into your everyday life too 
Have you tried braiding your hair  or used scrunchies   I am sorry if my suggestions are stupid  In my experience making something a hassle has stopped some of my annoying habits  I hope you find a solution that works for you 
Yes  as soon as you can human physically possible  Immediately  Tell your counselor before you even go to class  Just walk in and say you need to talk to someone in private right away  
Manic depressive introvert gamer teacher here   you're gonnna be fine bud  try to focus on one thing at a time and work methodically  If you need someone to chat to about personal issues then get in touch but I'll also help you out with study skills and exam prep if you want  Good luck mate
thank you I will seek help when needed 
I would suggest talking to him   When it happened to me  my now husband was very good to me just as you describe your boyfriend has been in the past   It may be easier if you can talk through it 
I try to be as brave as I possibly can for my family  Sadly this is the only way I feel safe expressing what I truly feel  The way I see it is I can't unload on my family or friends because it would probably be to much on some and others truly just don't care or at least don't care about me  But it is nice to know there are people in this world who care enough to talk to a stranger and help them out 
If there is one thing I have learned  it's that depression isn't logical
If it was such a serious concern then you must have been very strong through the year  I'm proud of you too 
No
fuck you  You have fucking idea  
Some medications raises your heart rate  maybe that's why yours is a little high   My heart rate was 80 90 when I was medicated  but now I am no longer on any meds and my heart rate is around 55 60bpm resting 
Oh sorry  I should've posted it in the first place  Here    http   waitbutwhy com 2014 06 taming mammoth let peoples opinions run life html  I can't trust hope again  I was deceived too often  I  was  looking around for a reason to live  Or to get the will to get better  It's a prestep if anything but I keep sabotaging and hindering myself even there    I'll look into the philosophy  thank you    Nothing that we do in this life is a waste   I can't see it this way  I pour my time down the gully  If others knew      It's not just my free time  It's what I studied  It's the job I have that's so pointless like I'm stuck in a Kafka novel  Looking for another one won't change much   At the moment not even art or music or literature that I create has any meaning anymore  The things that are truly meaningful in life in my eyes are valuable experiences and friendships  And I can't have either of them    I won't be able to forgive myself  or ever truly accept the past  i know I'll still have breakdowns and it's going to be a struggle to climb back up out of this hole but the thing is   I had so many desperate and dark moments the last months  And almost the worst thing about it is hearing "you just see it through black glasses  it's not that bad  it's not the truth"  But it is  This is fragile enough as it is  I don't need anyone else to pretend that it simply doesn't exist or it's just an ill brain making those things up    Some mornings I woke up and felt like I didn't have any problems at all  This is not a good state  It's not a free or happy state either  All my problems still did exist  I just couldn't remember them  This state was nothing but a whim of my body  brought by whatever hormonal changes  I neither can trust nor rely on those    When it became too bad I managed to do something else  I eventually managed to mentally push my problems aside  I knew they existed  I didn't ignore them and I didn't suppress them  Suppressing them would insinuate that I would think they don't exist  It was like taking a break from myself  Very fragile but it helped for the moment     Learn from your past to not continue doing the same bad habbits   I can't  This is the third time in my life that I think that I wasted my life  This means that everything I did since the last two times was pointless  If I stop doing one thing it searches itself another outlet  I don't know what's worse  walking into catastrophes with open eyes and fully knowing that ones actions are horrible or living obliviously  dishonestly and in a state of lying to oneself for years without noticing it  I did both    No one says you need to accept your wrongs but you do need to know them to not do them   Therapist says it  There is probably no other choice  And it sucks so much   Thanks for your answer as well 
Have you tried letting go and just sinking into the feeling on purpose  I mean  yes your body gets scared wheb you start to feel it  but you know for a fact that nothings really going to happen when you give into it  So just give into it and see where you go    But that's just my advice  You don't have to do it if you're not comfortable giving into irrational emotions
H is for happy U is for you G is for good   Mix it up around and "You  good happy" 
Nah man I'm not taking any meds by what I know
Look  I haven't had such an experience  but I know the way you feel about yourself  I know how it feels to feel that everyone would be better without me  or even if I wasn't born at all  All I do is give shit to everyone silently  so anyone notices how shit I'm inside  or pretend I think something when I really don't   All of what happened in my life feels my fault and that I was useless or even the cause of it  But I feel yours is different       If you would like to talk  DM me  whenever you want 
I don't think I can help but I can just offer similar story  I'm 30 yo male soon turning 31  Most of my life I was  and am currently  single  I've never spent Christmas  NYE or Valentines with SO  One small advice  maybe  try not to spend so much time on social networks  Try Facebook and Instagram fasting for a week for example  At the beginning it will be tough but after a few days it will be natural  I find out that there is usually nothing interesting on Facebook  same shit as yesterday  two hours ago  as five minutes ago  Just people trying to convince others that their lives are interesting  valuable    One way to get started is to delete Facebook and Instagram from phone and check them on your computer in the evening  And log off every time  
And like someone else suggested  music can help  Some calm ambient music like meditation music can help you stay calm as you guve into it  
I don't even acknowledge the new year anymore  People getting all happy and drunk over one year ending and another beginning  Why  A lot of people out there put on a different face and pretend thing's are better  But  the truth is harsh so it's ignored  People with depression don't have a choice  I went to bed and forced myself to sleep before my mind started running like it always does  I've been told "you get depressed on new years cause you don't want to do anything " No  I actually would like to do something but depression is one hell of a brick wall to knock down  I've been dealing with depression for about 25 years  what have I learned from all those years of pain and suffering   The New Year is full of shit 
If you want memes  reddit is the main source   
Deleting fb was one of my first steps towards recovery from depression
Thank you  It really made my day  and week     
You mentioned you checked your BPM when you experienced chest pains  Do you have a heart rate monitor fitbit apple watch  
Thank you
For me  when I'm dealing with an anxiety flare up  there's not much my boyfriend can say or do to help  and many times the things he says inadvertently make it worse   My mind isn't rational in those moments  so half of me is imagining these outlandish  "doom and gloom" scenarios where he's cheating on me  or he's not attracted to me  or he doesn't want to be with me  etc   etc   etc    while the other half knows that I'm taking small  insignificant little things and turning them into those doom and gloom prophecies   If we're apart  I'll usually just tell him "I'll talk to you later  I'm not thinking rationally right now   " and leave it at that  then I just let it run it's course   The only thing he can really say that will help even slightly  is to say he loves me no matter what  If we're together  the only things that he can do that help me are to just cuddle with me and tell me he loves me    and I just have to let it run its course   Either way  it's just something I have to suffer through  and there's not much he can do to fix it   It's kind of like a cold    There are things you can do to manage the symptoms  but you'll still have some  even if they are mild  and they won't completely go away until the cold is actually gone     I know it's probably not what you want to hear  but anxiety isn't rational   Nothing you can say or do will make him "snap out of it" because his mind isn't functioning properly in those moments   It's not like when you're on vacation and get lost  when you can just look at a map and see "oh I have to go that way   "  With anxiety  it's more like getting lost in a dangerous place  but for some weird reason you keep blowing up all the roads that would lead you to safety   It doesn't make any sense     I guess what I'm saying  is all you can really do is let him know you love him  cuddle him or hold his hand  unless he says otherwise      and not say anything at all   If he suffers from anxiety often  like every single day     when he has a moment of clarity  I'd sit down and seriously talk about getting therapy or talking to his doctor about it  which I'd do anyway      That's the only "sure" way to deal with anxiety  and even that doesn't work 100    
This year no one will remember when my birthday is because I won't havery fb to remind them but I know all theirs because I'm not a total ass hole and asked em and wrote that shit down in my calendar so I can still tell them happy birthday  I bet this year maybe two people will remember my birthday  God  Fb makes people so god damn lazy too  It was such a huge wake up those first few days when up realized just how much free time I had after I deactivated it  I can get so much more shit done now    I don't    but I CAN if I choose to  LOL  
Im just staring at this text box trying to figure out what to say  Im so fucking empty  
some people are getting used to just saying "I'm fine"
Good  You won't miss it
I find listening to podcasts comforting and provides a good distraction when you need a break from your thoughts

Your comment seemed lonely here  Allow me to accompany you 
Had this pretty badly the day after new years  Forgot to take my pills for a while with all the festivities  it's never been as bad as yesterday tho  I keep ruminating about new years  how I made a fool of myself  was hitting on people who weren't interested  god doing it right now 
Nope  Just did it the manual way  Timed myself for 10 seconds  counted my heart beats I generally find it too much trouble to try and find a pulse in my neck wrist  in that amount of time  then multiplied the amount of beats I got by 6
 hugs 
I see plenty of people trying to help here   And if there is a thread about one person feeling better the vast majority of comments are cheering for OP and wishing him her luck   Sadly there are also people who aren't able to grant other people some small pieces of sunlight  
Looks like they could've stopped at NEWS and after that they padded it out somewhat

I have  for complicated reasons  some memories about Seattle that I'd rather not rip up  I've never noticed the city in movies and shows  but somehow the last three shows I've watched were all set there  Just seeing it mentioned burns a hole in my chest 
I feel you man  been like that my whole life  pills have been a lifesaver though  also the thought of the vast expanse of space and time and how unimportant my life really is brings me comfort 
Just a heads up in case you didn't know if you are on any SSRI's maybe talk to your doctor about taking St John's Wort  
At least to sleep I turn on a fan and take melatonin  I understand that prescription medications work for some people but I'm against them  want to get over it naturally  but yeah melatonin has been working pretty well for me  good luck 
Hey man  I don't know much about body building  but if you are thinking of setting up a home studio you can teach yourself a lot via YouTube  Maybe even invest in some mirrors too so you can check your form

Meetup com has a bipolar support group in my area  try it for yours   I attended once  before my work schedule changed   Six or seven others with bp1 or bp2   
Hehe  I feel the same  it's heartening to see someone else saying this  Sometimes it helps me to see the humour in it  Like an Woody Allen movie  Don't worry  the only problem you have is the way you feel about it  you are doing everything else right 
I'm 18  And I see what you mean  
Thats why I watch depressing movies 
You should maybe call that number  We're creepy similar  I have a psych degree and struggled silently with SAD for years as well  I feel like maybe the training makes you feel like you should be able to handle it alone  I ended up in a similar situation to you   close brush with a lethal act  and thought alright  do I call that damn number  it's so useful to have a simple act to do instead of committing the    other act  or do I do this  And I called   So I basically entered a system from that point on where they wouldn't let me not check in with them  They didn't take me into supervised care or anything  but I was required to stay in contact and I basically gave them permission to rock up on my doorstep if I didn't call or turn up to the emergency appointment  Surprised the shit out of me the first time I flaked out  I don't know if they saved my life  but definitely playing along with the system I was scooped up by helped me back onto my feet and into a successful life   Sigh    I'm off my meds for the first time in six months and already I'm back on this forum  I dunno what this urge to quit them is  They say you're supposed to  but every time I try  here I am again

I had something kind of similar happen a while ago  Texted someone I hadn't talked to for a while a longass status update  didn't get a reply for weeks  I eventually asked her a short "are you okay" type question  Turns out she'd wanted to make sure she'd write a proper reply to my longass text  not just a "k"  and wasn't really sure what exactly to write  and kept putting it off  and then it had taken so much time that replying now would be awkward so she'd have to explain that  and then she kept putting THAT off  and on the whole it was basically the most relatable thing ever  
I was without facebook pretty much until 2 3 years ago  and only now use it for practical stuff  like quickly getting a hold of someone  I avoid looking at other people's pages  especially people I know  it will ONLY cause sadness 
And winning even in a small ordeal is very rewarding  
Rinse with something that kills germs after you brush  Saline solution  dissolve salt in warm water until you can't get any more salt to dissolve   mouthwash containing alcohol  or VERY DILUTE antiseptic  might be instructions on the bottle   are good ideas  Gum infections make your gums tender  and the brush can open little cuts which you need to clean   just like you'd clean any other wound  You can also try flossing after that  and then rinsing again  for proper clean  I'm putting off going to the dentist too  and if I'm strict about this  my gums stop being sore and getting cut so easily 
Okay  If this worries you I'd suggest going to the doctor and get them to test your heart  They can lend you a heart rate monitor and see if your values are normal or not   When I measure my heart rate at the doctor it can be as high as 80 90bpm  but my resting heart rate is way lower 
I know what that's like  not being able to talk to someone in your life and not wanting to burden them  I was singing in a youth choir several years ago and I made friends much younger than I  Eventually I left because I felt it was unfair for them to listen to and deal with all my adult baggage  However  despite my thinking that  some of them got back in touch and we're pretty close 
Did that 2 years ago and it's empowering in the fact that nobody knows anything about me or my personal life at all  especially after passage of 2 years       But it's impossible to network  degree of issue that this poses is very dependent on age    Either way  not going back and don't mind being really excluded from popular culture in this form   While my mental health remains far from heathy normal      I know FB is not something I can have 
Not really for in the moment of it  but the past year has helped me gain confidence and see the world a bit differently  With some huge  to me  changes with a work relocation followed by a new job  and a minor accident I found it was the changes they bought around for me that helped me most  A friend helped and encouraged me throughout to trying new  safe things  Going to places I hadn't been before  I even tried dancing  which was something I ruled out from a kid  Now I intend to go more regularly  Perhaps some regular safe things just outside his comfort zone that you can do together may help a little  I can't thank my friend enough for how much they've helped me through the changes  I feel much more able and happy  A few minor blips but I'm now grateful for the changes forced on me  I'm sure you're doing great in being so supportive 
Codecademy makes it really simple  Doesn't provide a lot of advice on how to actually get started building stuff  but if you learn Python  you can go to the Django  a Python web framework  website and follow the tutorials there  which actually guide you through building a site of your own using Python  Then you can modify that 
I get them daily  They're usually random and short  but sometimes they can last forever it seems  Left chest  right chest  sternum  random areas of the rib cage  shoulder blades etc  It's perfectly normal IMO  but if you're truly worked  see your doc and see what they can do for you 
http   www brainphysics com yourenotgay php  I recommend checking out this article to anyone with homosexuality themes in OCD   it's written by a gay OCD sufferer who REALLY knows what he's talking about    If you're finding that typing out an account of your probable HOCD symptoms helps you feel better  consider that maybe you're using typing it out as a compulsion  Does it make you feel more at ease in the immediate short term  a bit 'reassured'  but then later you've got a bit of an urge to go type out more of it  or you feel you need more reassurance that you're not gay  It's just a guess  but it can be a bit of an indication  A lot of us with OCD  myself included  find that writing out long descriptions of how our symptoms must mean our obsession is DEFINITELY not true and DEFINITELY ridiculous makes us feel better temporarily  It's the reason a lot of OCD sufferers are now writing great books about what it's like to have OCD      If you just mean that writing it down is helping you get a clearer picture of what's happening  then obviously that's not the same thing and it's perfectly fine  I'm not saying this to accuse you of anything  just to make you aware that it's really common for a lot of us with OCD to accidentally aggravate our symptoms by checking doing rituals seeking reassurance writing down self reassuring things  and that we usually feel better when we re train our brains not to over analyse and ruminate like this   Do consider seeing a proper therapist about potential OCD  if these symptoms persist  It's always easier to fix OCD if you catch it early  than if you let it carry on for years and years  because your brain's pretty mouldable and changeable  and you start to 'rewire' it into a worse and worse OCD habit the more you do compulsions around the idea of being gay  It's a real  serious medical problem and you deserve real  proper help with it if you feel you need it  It's fine to be independent  but   ya know  opening up to a non judgy  confidential professional can still be the right thing to do  independence or no 
I can relate  One thing I am trying out is called mindfulness  My favorite book is called  wherever you go there you are  You can easily find the audio on YouTube  I highly recommend it  Please get back to me for an update   
27 year old here  I've been out of my rapid cycling phase and unmedicated for about 3 years now  and I have got to be honest with you  you probably don't want friends with mental illnesses all that much  I was an absolute horror show to deal with at times in my early 20s  Like you said you want friends who understand the complexity of mental illness  in my experience most reasonable people can get a grasp of what's going on if you explain calmly    The key is that your diagnosis is an explanation for your manic or depressed moods and the problems that come with them  Your diagnosis is not an excuse for that behavior  When you find friends who understand that  support you  and call you out on your shit I think you'll do fine  Don't hesitate to tell people what's going on  
Yes  I hate when people pity someone just because they didn't spend NYE partying with others  Well  this applies generally  not only to NYE  
That IS AWESOME  Dude 
It sounds like you are in a really tough situation right now  My best advice would be to first avoid anything intoxicating   it's likely not the cause of your reaction  but it can certainly amplify anything you are feeling or going through  Otherwise  you should make seeking therapy your number one priority  With ptsd  whatever you are going through is normal and you are not alone  But it does sound like you really could use some real help  and even if you can't get it immediately  just working towards figuring out how you can can help you more than being on your own  Are there any support groups in your area you might be able to attend    I've been there myself  with the drinking and the freak outs  and while I never hurt anyone  i hurt myself a lot instead  I was violent to myself   Please forgive yourself  You can press on  you can get through this  Please understand that what you are going through happens to a lot of people with ptsd  We are in so much pain we wind up doing things to protect ourselves  it's like instinct  The pain is almost stamped into our minds  and sometimes that shapes how we react to today more what actually happens today  It happens to the best of us  and I more than understand how it feels to have that happen  and to come up with every terrible way to feel and see yourself after  But you are hurting  you are in pain  and no human has all the tools equipped to handle that  Not a single person  So forgive yourself  Have hope that you can make yourself whole again  because you can

Yeah  I have like four people I still follow lol  Eeeegh  I still get urges to delete it  Occasionally people from school get in touch though  and I'd basically lose touch without that  It sucks that you have to keep something that makes you unhappy  I'd much rather someone just keep a list of email addresses   
Hi there and welcome  First of all a big pat on the back for the running I really hope it helps   I think you have thought through your options pretty well so I will try to add a bit more meat to those bones   You don't need a lot of equipment to work out at home  Take a look at  r bodyweightfitness and their recommended routine  I work out at home myself  All the equipment I have is a kettlebell  a sandbag  a suspension trainer  a weighted vest and a slosh tube  You are right though that starting lifting without someone to show you the ropes is potentially dangerous either in the short term throw your back out lifting too much scenario or the long term muscle imbalances scenario  I just did a quick google and I am surprised that there are not more 24 7 gyms in West London  Most gyms do open up around 6 6 30am  Thats the time I used to go to the gym  Normally at that time of day there are only a few people there who quite often don't want any social contact either  Having said that normally people in gyms are as friendly and supportive as you can get  Likewise if you want to be left alone just jam your headphones on and people get the message   I did another quick google and there are a few personal trainers in West London that kind of specialise in clients with mental health problems  This could be a gold mine for you perhaps    who knows  I would think its got to be worth a try at the least   Best of luck  let us know how you get on  I am sure your experiences will benefit lots of other people 
I care  I'm here for you  You're not alone
I took it for 3 days  then switched to buspar on the 3rd day  My stomach ache was mostly gone by the day after
You don't have to deal with it alone  You have the community here  and as much as I hate to say it  professional help might be a good idea  They will give you tools to help deal with it
I had a day this week where I couldn't make it out of the driveway but the next day I made it out just fine  Some days just suck more than others I guess 
Are you diagnosed with OCD    If not  this doesn't necessarily have very much to do with OCD  Your flatmate just sounds like a somewhat unhygienic sort of person  but anyone  with or without OCD  can find someone else's personal habits gross  Personally I would say you're justified to ask him to clean any part of the problem that affects you  i e  the smell   but not so justified to ask him to clean parts that don't  I  e  the sheets  Only he has to sleep on them  after all    If you have a diagnosed case of OCD  you can probably temporarily request a higher level of cleanliness  since it causes you genuine psychological distress and it's discrimination against your disability for someone to deliberately trigger your mental health problem   but in the long run  therapy and medication so you can better tolerate more variation in someone else's hygiene can be a good idea too  I mean  we all have to live with mucky people sometimes     
I like Mr Robot  or the first season of True Detective  I guess I have a thing for tortured characters  
Yep  it's like celebrating a birthday which i find weird  because i'm getting older and hence more regret etc   
I've been struggling with suicidal thoughts too  It's a hell of a fight  But please know that you're not alone in fighting for that  If there is anything you need or just want to talk  shoot a pm  I may not have the best advice but I'm all here to listen  Happy New Year x
Long distance is so hard  Especially when one person is off having new experiences  it's always worst for the person "left behind"   She shouldn't have told you she is sick of you being insecure  it's not your fault  If you've been together 1 5 years  you need to talk to her about how she is making you feel  It won't feel right if she comes back and just tries to have things go back to the way they were
Wow that really  really sucks  Dude I think you happened to get a couple of shitty people because the 2 times I've called suicide hotlines the kind stranger on the other end literally saved my life   oh wow  that's a shitty thing to happen     are you ok  There's plenty of people on here who can relate to you  you can rage or vent or just get shit off your chest  The sub is always here   
But to be fair I know it's just the lack of social skills  and the anxiety   It's the "not knowing what to do after  hi  or  are you enjoying the party  " line or the awkwardness in finally approaching someone you have been walking towards when they're right in front of you that made me get too insecure and become awkward   For what it's worth I've seen 2 or 3 people at random act like this before where it wasn't me  so I have a sense of what it looks like from the outside  People can tell you're awkward but ultimately they don't judge too hard and if they make remarks like "I get the feeling you want to be part of the conversation" or something  they don't do it to point out how awkward you are but to air out the awkwardness and give you a chance to join in   And lastly  I kinda did enjoy going after all  Normally I get really sad during New Year's Eve in previous years because I've had two years when I didn't go to anything and just stayed with my mom who didn't have any guests either  and it just felt lonely  To me NYE is the day when you recollect your thoughts and think back on everything that's happened for one year and it can be quite sad when you realize you haven't really moved an inch  so at least  this year I could tell myself I was at a place where people had fun and I like the memory of being around people as opposed to feeling isolated 
Only a minor setback  
That's pretty cool  I'm sure I'll figure something out eventually  Thank you for talking with me it has really helped 
I used to have it much more  I guess I've just kinda learned to make myself more      present  If that makes sense 
The people on the other end just see this as a job  They don't realize their importance and by that matter are complete assholes    You're not worthless  the idiots just didn't care  And they wouldn't have cared if you were anyone else in the world  So no  they are wrong  not you
As a depressed person  I've had some similar thoughts about the "wallowing" criticism and such    Maybe I am wallowing  I don't know  But it helps to see how others talk about and respond to things that I also deal with  Some thoughts are quite striking or resonating  Maybe that's why

From reading this post I would say you sound like there is still life and energy inside you   Take it from someone who's been on this shitty carnival ride for over 15 years  get out and find happiness while that spark is inside you  Don't get to be my age and realise the time has passed  and all you got left is to wake up the next day  and the next  and so on and so forth til you eventually die or take your own life   Sounds like you got a journey to go on   Best of luck 
Hi folks   I'm having a really tough time trying to handle my anxiety lately  I'm hoping to seek some new coping methods and identify more about my anxiety in the future  Thanks for having me 
No worries mate  all the best   
Hmmm  well for me going to sleep is one step closer to waking up and dealing with tomorrow  It's gonna be a long night     Best of luck friend 
Finding the "reason" may not be possible now or really solve much  I think that treating the anxiety response and learning to cope with the symptoms may be the best path to discovering the root  My emotional overreactions completely cloud my ability to find reason  Mindfulness based stress reduction helps me quite a bit  as did developing my crisis protocol  which is a list of tasks that work best for me when I'm overwhelmed by anxiety  Regaining control of my ability to respond to stress helps me cope with the root problem  
They truly are  And definitely a great stepping stone towards taking a class that requires your physical presence

Primarily cognitive obsessive compulsive disorder  also commonly called "primarily obsessional OCD"  purely obsessional OCD  Pure O  OCD without overt compulsions or with covert compulsions  is a lesser known form or manifestation of OCD   Commonly referred to as Pure O by the OCD community  Pure O is a form of OCD where people mistakenly believe that it differs from traditional OCD  in that it features no outward compulsive manifestations  instead  the anxiety inducing obsessions take place only in the mind    However  a person with Pure O will still have compulsions which mainly manifest as unseen mental rituals  and they will usually also engage in compulsive behaviours like seeking reassurance from loved ones  and avoidance of particular objects  places or people  They are compulsions  nonetheless  which is why the term Pure O is somewhat imprecise   Pure O is like any other form of OCD  it will involve both obsessions and compulsions which are the problems that need addressing through Cognitive Behavioural Therapy  CBT    Understanding Pure O by Scott   This Understanding Pure O guide may help you further understand this often misunderstood form of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder   Taken from Wiki and OCD UK  
I'm so glad that you stopped and that you're still with us  Don't let the list of things you want to do empty  keep adding things to the list 
No  if you don't want to wait to see your doctor  call tomorrow and explain your issue over the phone  
but like your title says  you're alive  If you're still underage  your parents knowing is a good thing  They're there to support you 
Actually   They aren't  They think my depression is something I made up to act badly   For example  saying I do not want to argue over my bedroom'd situation  
Hopefully when your parents have time with the psychologist they may change their viewpoint  Another adult confirming what you are telling them
SSRIs just aren't particular great drugs for OCD  They're 40  years old  they don't work on the actual neurotransmitters that are probably the main problem in OCD  they weren't even designed for OCD in the first place  and the side effects are often unhelpful to recovery  We all talk like it's 'normal' to have to try 20 different meds and waste months of our lives on side effects and withdrawal and waiting for them to 'kick in'  but actually    is this really the best we can do  Really   D  So don't worry that it's you that's not responding properly  They're genuinely just patchy drugs that mysterious don't work on some people  Some people get a great response to them and it luckily takes away their symptoms 100   others  like me  take Anafranil Clomipramine and find that it doesn't exactly stop the OCD symptoms  but it takes the edge off them and makes them more manageable  Others find nothing whatsoever happens   There's some research that you might find useful in your situation  explaining  maybe  why Anafranil works for some people but not others  Apparently  it could be to do with the amount of brain 'growth factor' substance you have   https   blogs scientificamerican com scicurious brain using bdnf to predict antidepressant response     It's called BDNF if you want to Google it  brain derived neurotrophic factor   and it just means that maybe Anafranil mostly just works by making your brain more changeable and flexible and able to grow new connections   but if you don't supply the Anafranil with this BDNF  it may not work  Apparently you can increase your BDNF levels a lot by doing things like meditation  exercise  getting good sleep  learning new things and eating well  which is probably one mechanism why doing these things tend to make those of us with OCD feel better   It's not totally certain research  but it might show that your Anafranil needs some input  therapy or lifestyle changes on your part to help it work well   Also  making sure your brain has enough of the right other chemicals to rebuild itself and regrow healthier new pathways can be useful  There's some evidence that getting extra of particular nutrients can make Anfranil and other SSRIs more effective  http   www news medical net news 20160426 Nutritional supplements can enhance effectiveness of antidepressants aspx    Obviously this isn't saying 'eating totally random vitamin pills magically makes SSRIS work LOL '  but it is saying that we know that things like Omega 3s and Vitamin D help the brain to work more smoothly and calmly  and they can work together with your Anafranil to improve the effect   Obviously  there are other practical things you can do to try and improve the effect of your Anafranil too   increasing the dosage  for example  I noticed a difference when I went from 100mg Anafranil to 200mg  Getting good sleep can be important too  because some research suggests that it's during sleep your antidepressant REALLY does the hard work of re wiring and re organizing your brain  again  I found that my OCD improved more slowly if I had insomnia     Basically  the situation with meds can be more complex than just which SSRI you put into your body  But the good news is that there's probably lots of things in your control that you could do to try and get the drugs working at maximum capacity   
Not everyone is the same or has the same reactions to different substances   I have anxiety with or without caffeine  but with caffeine it gets a lot worse   But everyone is different

Save up the   you used to spend on those 5 cups of coffee   after a year  buy yourself something really cool   That could ease some of the pain 
Practice  Doing deep belly breathing several times a day can help you develop the skill and create positive associations with the effects of it  
Yeah  I enjoy the celebrations of new year  the fireworks and such  But then it just comes back to feeling as bad as before

i have now stopped sharing anything with her  coz whenever I discuss my feelings  she makes it about herself and says how unlucky she is that she is stuck with me and sort     So  with no interest or motivation left in life and no support  I am just waiting for the day my mind will give up and i'll pass on from this world

I was young when my parents got a divorce but they would always yell so hard  Especially my dad  he has anger issues he'd shout and kick his feet on the ground   I remember hiding under the table because I was so afraid and my brother would tell me I was overreacting  My fears were always looked at as exaggerating and "I had to grow up"    Loud noises scare me and whenever someone gets annoyed or angry I'm afraid they would shout at me or hit me  
not all heroes wear capes  thnks dude
Yo I've probably read that article you've linked maybe 5 times already in the past 3 months  so I think I get what you mean about the whole 'Ruminating' and 'seeking reassurance' and I really understand that it isn't healthy anymore   But in a way this almost feels different it feels nice to be just open about what my feelings are here  and I mean when I type it out and confess it to someone else it does almost make it seem silly  but you're right this is kind of a first step towards talking to a professional about it   But just talking about my issue and understanding the feelings a little better does relieve some stress even if its only in the short term  But I guess I'll keep on going  if there's any other links you've got that might help me feel  free to link them  I'll give them a once over and try and stop going back to them after today and just try techniques that the first comment talked about   thanks again for the help  Really appreciate it  Especially the honesty 
why 
Whenever I was old enough to understand death  I balled my eyes of frequently  I knew my parents were a lot older than me  and that they would probably die before I did  That was my biggest fear at your daughter's age   I'm going to take a quote from The Office  "Fear plays an interesting role in our lives  How dare we let it motivate us  How dare we let it into our decision making  into our livelihoods  into our relationships "  S8E5   My biggest fear now is not being happy for the rest of my life  Sure I'll be happy sometimes  but I want to figure out my formula to get the most out of it 
I read that as choking the children and I was  REALLY  confused for a minute there wow I'm tired
Well she is not wrong  I would have picked her up  But breaking up for this is a bit too much  Maybe she will come back  break ups are not always permanent  
It sounds like your sister's words really hit you hard and I'm sorry you had to hear that  Even if she doesn't care what happens to you  I do care  And from what I can tell  you are already putting in your best effort to cope with your depression and retain a semblance of a life  It's a pity she doesn't see that  
 hugs 
I know  It's awesome  Many people may find this subreddit very useful and supportive  but might not know about it  Hooray 
 hugs   I can very much relate to this  She left at some point  probably a while ago  I still remember the scent of her hair  the way her hand felt in mine  her head against my chest when we embraced for the last time    I don't know where she is  And I'm terrified of forgetting 
Completely understand how you feel  23 F from Australia and I find I'm only content when I'm around people  I was dumped yesterday and have found myself too sitting at home wondering why I can't be happy when I'm by myself  The situation obviously doesn't help  but it's very hard to distract yourself when you're alone  I'm not sure exactly what it is  but I too haven't learnt how to be happy alone  I guess we're both here for the same reason 
Thank you  I appreciate it   After seeing all these comments I can see how many people have this problem as well    I'm slowly explaining my boyfriend about this and I've told him I'm sometimes afraid he'd hit me even if I don't think he's that kind of a person    It's a horrible thing to expierence  I think people should at least apologise after shouting so that we know we didn't deserve to be yelled at    I can live with it to be honest  if people can be understanding towards it that is   Being told you're overreacting and you're not being your usual "you" sucks   This is a part of me now and it's not a feeling I can control 
That's one decision I've made that I'm very happy with  Did it about 5 years ago and do not miss it  I know it's criticized as being "edgy" to philosophize about the damage of social media  but I honestly think it's a big part of what seems so different about people these days  Everybody seems so self centered and selfish and I guess that's bound to happen when multiple times a day you're figuring out what picture or information to post online and have your ego stroked  And yes  not having to look at the curated and edited version of everyone else's life that they put forward is a nice benefit  But then it's also depressing knowing I'll probably never meet someone who isn't pulling out their phone every 5 minutes to check social media  
I'm so sorry  Sometimes people truly suck 
Hello   My experience might be different since I met a psychologist first  which later referred me to a psychiatrist so that I can get prescription meds  For me  to talk about my problems to a stranger was too overwhelming and I'll tend to forgot important things  so I would suggest to write them in short notes beforehand so that you can tell them the problem that need most immediate attention and later you can disscuss more about other problems in future sessions   During first session  they usually ask you why you came  what bothers you most  how it affects your functioning and life  your backgrounds  family etc  to get to know and understand you better  Sometimes they might ask you to do some test  like depression anxiety scale or sth  forgot the name  but that really depends on your problems  They MIGHT prescribe you some medications to REDUCE the symptoms  not treat them  and you might need to attend therapy  which actually helps in the long run  In the end  the goal is for you to be able to cope with your problems without any meds  so don't just think the meds are the answers   And if they think you need meds  they might take some blood as baseline  as some meds have certain side effects   I've heard about some other people who went to GP first and referred to psychiatrist  while there are some people who went to see the psychiatrist staright away  No matter what you do  getting help is the biggest and most important step  so don't forget to give credit to yourself     And there are also people who doesn't actually have anxiety depression  anything  but it's really okay  so don't worry  just go see them    Don't be like me  who thought my problems weren't that important and by the time I finally decided to get help  everything had already blown out of proportions   
I've basically ignored that question my entire life  I consider a gesture like a wave or saying hi more than it's an actual question  Always just answer it with "fine" and move on  I actually find it gross any time someone actually takes the opportunity to say "I'm great " and then ramble on about some awesome thing that just happened to them    If I had just won a million dollars and somebody asked me how I'm doing I would just say fine  
I finally texted my boss and asked if I could get more morning shifts instead of evenings  It was so scary cause earlier I thought evevnings would be better for me and so I told my boss that I want to work at evenings  Anyway now I've realized that I like my job more when I get there at morning even it means that I have to wake up at 4 am  but even that is better than sitting at home all day crying and having anxiety because the waiting is so stressfull  
Yes  I live in Texas   I will go take a look at this immediately  thank you for the resource 
Escapism is the way to cope with things  I think that most of people really deep inside know how things truly are but are too busy to think about it  It's when we are alone that we get darker thoughts are are our true selves  
damn  all i gotta say to that is AMEN
Not really  It wasn't even till the next day   Only within minutes or hours  I feel horrible again 
It sucks to care for someone so much only to be forgotten
I'm so sorry that happened  A loss like that is never easy to deal with and you must be in so much pain right now  It does take a lot of time  and perhaps therapy sessions  to get over the feeling of having lost everything  but I urge you to reach out to people IRL  even if you haven't spoken to them in a while  and find an outlet for the kinds of feelings you're having  even if it's just screaming and hitting pillows  Eventually his leaving you will no longer be about losing your entire world  but rather just a miniscule part of it  I'm rooting for you  Take care  
It's always hard to judge when you notice something like this about yourself whether it's just the way you are or hints at something that could use some adjusting  You just don't want to end up being someone who constantly has to chase after some sort of companionship because you can't stand to spend an evening alone  I know one or two people like that who get off of work at the end of the day and then their sole mission in life is just to run through their contact list one by one and figure out who is available to distract them that night  And I'm not assigning this behavior to them  they've flat out admitted they can't stand to be alone  Life would seem pretty exhausting if you constantly have to be in pursuit of some sort of distraction and live in fear that you're gonna find a gap in your calendar where you have to spend some time by yourself  And it's insulting being friends with that type of person when you know the invitation to hang out on certain days just means they got that far down in the contact list and decided to ask you    I guess it more so hinges on if it's just the fact that you're alone that brings about the depression  or if you're depressed or have other things on your mind that finally come out when you find yourself alone  If it's solely that the being alone itself is what rubs you the wrong way  that's not good  You should be able to enjoy some alone time  If it's that other fears and doubts creep out when there isn't something to distract your senses  then you have to try to figure out what that might be  
Hey  Thanks for the suggestion I am currently looking into it  But then my question is doing so aren't you becoming more aware of things  Like wont your thoughts still be there  
Time is the only solution that really helps  but it is important to know that you WILL get through this  It helps to surround yourself with family or a hobby you really like  focus on something that interests you  get your mind off things and keep yourself busy  After some time goes by you will find yourself thinking of him less and less until one day  he never crosses your mind  
 3  a big warm hug  
Yeah  I loved her  even though I also accepted that we would always be just friends  The last time I saw her I'd told her I wanted to be around for her more from now on  But I don't think I'll have the chance to now 
It sounds like you have places to go and meanings to seek  I'm excited for you 
I have same problems and I've been working on it too    Currently  whenever I have those thoughts  I would stop and remind myself to take one thing at a time  and the future will decide itself  I will do relaxation and breathing technique  exercise  yell "STOP " and go on doing whatever I want to do without thinking about anything  Basically  I try to distract myself rather than focusing on those thoughts  I heard that some people actually took a pen and wonders about the colour  shape  every lines  nook and cranny of the pen to stop the negative thoughts    There's also a set of questions that helps to challenge those thoughts  google "challenging negative thoughts" or do this exercise http   www moodjuice scot nhs uk challengingthoughts asp   It might not help you instantly but I find that the more I do this  the less time I spend mulling on negative thoughts     Hope that helps   
I finally start talking to people at school  I was very happy  And the attacks are getting milder and bearable these days   
My first reaction was to start typing and say of course this is creepy and unhealthy  But there's one thing that comes before anyone else's opinion  and that is whether or not you are okay with this  If you know deep down that you want a real committed future with someone and not some half measure where they can't marry you because of their mommy  then no  of course this is not okay  On the other hand  if the official title or status of the relationship doesn't matter much to you and you're happy existing in a situation that is pretty much a dead end while you maybe keep your eye out for other opportunities  nobody else has the right to tell you whether that's okay or not   Based on what you wrote I'd have to assume this is of course not the situation you wanted otherwise you wouldn't be here asking about it    He's 28  Of course anyone would be hurt by hearing their parent make a threat of suicide or something like that  but at the end of the day his mother is of the previous generation and he has his own life to live and should understand that he has to think about his own future and not throw away opportunities in his own life because his mother made threats    I think there's one strong possibility here that you may not like to confront  Rather than seeing this as his manipulative mother coming in and messing things up and tearing him away from you  you have to consider that if he gave up the fight that easily that he must not have been too concerned about having a real future with you or taking this relationship to the point of full commitment  I can tell you right now if I deeply loved someone  even my own family trying to come between us and manipulate me with some silly threats wouldn't be enough that suddenly I'm willing to distance myself from that person  So don't do him the favor of acting like he's an equal victim of circumstance here and that you've both had your future taken away because of her  He wouldn't be going along with her demands if he valued having a real future with you  In the end this gives you a clear window into how much he was concerned about you and having that future together  and it doesn't seem like much  No man who loves you could be taken away from you by his mother  That's his problem to live with and maybe some day in the future come to realize how foolish he was that he made that more important than you  But don't look at this like it's the circumstances keeping him from you  He's allowing himself to be kept from you    If you wanted more than some relationship that can never be anything official  then of course it is unhealthy to put aside what you know is right for you and try to go along with it  Of course this all depends on what is causing the problem in a relationship  if you were here saying you want a man who can provide you all the money and riches in the world and you're not sure if you can settle  it might be different to try to tell you that you're hung up on all the wrong things and you should be able to love the person anyway  But this situation is not like that  It's an an unhealthy desire to actually want to have a full  admitted future with someone and not have to treat it like some dirty secret that can't be talked about    And if he's actually saying he'd go along with it if his mom finally sound some other person that she'd approve of him marrying  then hell no there's no reason for you to stay in this  What are you gonna do  spend years of your life as his companion until the mother finally "hires" him a wife and then you get left in the dust   It's over  A 28 year old man just let his mother come before you  You can do better than that  If you struggle with self esteem or self worth like so many of us do  it's all too easy to take the wrong road in a situation like this and decide to put up with it  if you have fears and doubts about meeting somebody else or if you still want to justify having strong feelings for this person  But I hope you won't  It won't be easy and it's going to hurt  It's pretty cowardly of him that rather than him accepting it's his limitations that are ruining this and he should be the one to end it by acting like a man  it ends up as if you're the one who has to break off the relationship instead when you're not the one with the demanding mother threatening suicide  So it reveals something else less than ideal about him that he'd be okay to stick you in this horrible position and now is going to let you carry the burden of making the tough choices    You may care about him but I hope with what happened here that you can maybe see him in a new light and see how weak and pathetic he is acting and maybe that will break the spell about how much you think you love him and make it a little easier to walk away  The refer to these things in relationships as "Red flags" and ultimate we seal our own fate when we either decide to pay attention to those warning signs or try to look away and keep marching forward anyway  You've received a pretty huge red flag in this situation  I wouldn't ignore it  Find something better  Let him be in a relationship with his mom and she can pick a wife for him  Yikes    He's winning a really unfair game right now  that you're continuing to date him and give him all the same sort of access to you despite being told this new change in circumstances  You deserve to be with someone who has to put an equal amount into the relationship and wants the same type of future as you do  
I sure hope so  thank you 
Having fun with friends  clock strikes midnight    I look around at all the happy couples and my heart sinks  I'm so envious of these people who seem so happy  I know what it feels like  and I desperately want to feel it again    There are many times where I've wanted to give up  but I've made it my goal  my mission  to be one of those people next year   To be a person excited to ring in the new year  sharing a new year's kiss and genuinely be enjoying life    I'm gonna be happy again one day    It may not be this year  and it may not be next year and there'll be a lot of pain along the way   There may be a 0 0001  of finding happiness  but if I give up now  I have no chance  
You need to keep taking them though  The way I see it  meds don't really change who we are  we're still the same person really  they just increase our level of functioning somewhat  
Man I need to do this    The amount of time my wife spends on FB and her phone in general is depressing   Like I get to the point were I tell her if she gave a 1 10 of the effort into our marriage that she does the phone we would be better off   But she just ignores me and does it even more      Sigh 
 hugs  I'm sorry it's been such a rough time  Sending you all the love and strength to hang in there  3
Hugs
You might find them boring initially but once you get into them you'll love it  Maybe  I know nothing about you so I couldn't say  but those shows are God tier  and it's worth giving it a shot even if you're a little bored at first 
I think that's the best gift to yourself  to have that resolution and to stick to it no matter what  
I'm sorry to hear about your breakup  It's kinda comforting to know I'm not the only one who feels this way though  Hopefully we figure our shit out  Cheers from the U S of A 
My advice  make a list of all the creative projects and ideas and from that pick the one that's the most fun interesting of the bunch  Another way to think of it is consider what you were most looking forward to doing with your free time once winter break started  Then set a ridiculously easy goal as the first step  eg  for a writing prompt  just the first sentence  so you actually get started  With any luck that gets the ball rolling into that laser focused state where you lose track of the time  Hope that helps 
For me it does
It's crazy that we're brought up by a society that teaches us to ask this question as a polite gesture  not as a genuine concern  The response is always expected to be positive  and if it's anything otherwise  some of us don't know what to say  and often think the other person is just being a whiner  We were never taught how to respond to this type of answer  because we are almost forced to pretend like everything is just peachy   all the time  It's just really sad  and still so crazy to me  
Did the same does feel much better  Also there are much better sources for memes than FB 
Reading this made me tear up  I am in mourning too  I'm so sorry for your loss  The pain must be simply immense and indescribable  But I believe we'll get through  Big hugs from me to you  
Sorry for the late reply  haven't used reddit in ages  yes I have very low body fat  
Hey bud  I care 
Thank you  And I am sorry  I know how uncomfortable and disheartening it is  
I am your first paragraph  Although I do feel like I'm at the tail end of things going catastrophic and I might get my life together  Shoot me a pm if you'd like to talk  As long as you're a male we could be clones 
Thank you  this gives me hope  I've been stuck in that next day cycle  and it's scaring me to not have control over my future and thoughts  Maybe your ride is due for an upgrade  hope life treats you well friend 
Hey  I'm here for you  Would you like to talk more about this 
To be honest  it's a good thing that you try to solve your current task  rather than moving from one another and leaving them incomplete 
I have just deleted it with IG in the same time as you  I'm thinking of break up with my gf particularly due to social media  she's touchy abt social media  e g  if there's a simple quarrel between us  she'd change her profile picture and cover and her status etc     she lies on Instagram and envy her friends on Facebook  I have just noticed that  but I shouldered alot of bruises from her lately so I can't continue with her for the long run   any advices 
How did you met her and why did she dumped you  
You're definitely not alone there  I'm trying to learn how to be comfortable without social contact  but as soon as my friends are busy I start feeling that lonely feeling and it's really hard to shake  Sometimes I'll even just put the TV on because that's kind of comforting in a sense that others are watching too  Probably sounds weird af haha  If you pick up any tips  please share   
What exactly happened  
This is amazing 
The world is your mirror  Good idea
I agree  Sometimes I feel like shit when I'm off of them  but whether it's for two days or two weeks that I've been off of them  I always come back to them  
My father had something sort of similar   his feet would shake tremble when he tried to go down stairs  or put on slippers  or anything that required motor control  It was PTSD  he got into regular therapy  and the symptoms abated  Essentially  the brain  after being ignored so long  used the body to force the issue  Have you and your psych looked at things in your past 
That's an interesting way to phrase it  I've enjoyed being alone in the past  so I reckon it's more so the "other things on  my  mind that finally come out when  I  find  myself  alone " The thing I struggle with I suppose is that I'm not even sure what these other things are  There's no concrete thought like "I'm worthless " it's just a general bad feeling  I wonder if that feeling maybe just means the chemicals in my brain are messed up  Because nothing in my life really warrants depression  shit's been pretty good overall  Meds don't sound like a good idea to me though  because once I am with others  I do a lot better  And when I'm at school  I'm hardly ever alone because I'm in a friend group that all lives in the same building   I can't imagine myself ending up like those people you know  though I'll keep them in mind as something to not become  You're right in that it would feel shitty to be the last person on the contact list and everything   Thank you for taking the time to respond 
I'm here to listen  if you need to vent anymore 
I'm sure this is a meme or something   
Me either  Like I'm lucky if I get small 3 4 hour blocks of solid sleep 
Congrats and good job  I know and understand how hard it is  Hell  I've been keeping it to myself for YEARS  Know that you are so lucky and blessed that your parents are very supportive and accepting you as you are  You can use that as motivation to get better       mine  not so much  I was actually scolded and told things    Althought we used to have very good relathionship    maybe because I'm no longer the smart kid 
Hang in there   I never would have thought I would be  in the same mind set of stay alive but since last year I'm struggling 
Fuck friends who don't reply to you after you send a text message  period  If they can't be bothered then neither can I  
I'm 17 as well and at the complete opposite end of the spectrum  I don't even know if I'm attractive or not  but my grades started fantastic at the start of the year and now they're complete shit  I have a lot of c's and very few a's  I feel he exact same way  but you have a huge advantage on me  You actually have a chance at succeeding in life  Please  for every depressing thought that runs through my dying mind  don't waste it    you have so much potential  I have nothing  live your life  get a good job  do what I'll never be able to do 
Dealing with constant depression is   exhausting    We all know how you feel   you're not alone in this   Whatever you do  just take it one day at a time  
Nah  definitely not weird  The only tip I've really got is that sometimes I'll go for a run or bike ride  and that helps  It's getting too cold here to do that  but I imagine in Australia it's probably pretty warm this time of year   I'll also try to do something that requires more concentration than watching TV  like   and this is where I'll sound weird   I like translating songs from English into Spanish and vice versa  I learned Spanish in middle and high school  and doing the translating helps me not forget it  And since it requires some brain power  I get distracted  Though I guess distracted is not the same as being comfortable alone  but it does help   If I pick up any less oddly specific tips  I'll definitely send them your way      oh wait I just remembered one more thing actually  When I'm at school and want to be around people but my friends are doing something else  I'll go to the library or a cafe to read or do work or something  That way  even though I'm not interacting with people  I'm still around them  Hearing the distant chatter is kinda comforting

I was repeatedly emotionally abused  no  tormented  for years after my father's death  I was the only one to deal with the brunt if my mom's episodes  she'd kick me out and if I refused to come home she would threaten me  Once I would return home  this happened many times  she would be in the psych ward for about a week and there was sharpie all over the walls lying about how nobody cared about me and my dead dad 'never wanted me'  I was 10 when he died  he was my everything and he spoiled me with love  Finally  after being the victim of all of her abuse  I was freed right before my 15th birthday  By finding her dead in her bed  At least she died from something other than suicide    It's been 4 years and I still have nightmares almost every night of her coming and stalking me  and running her normal mental tormentation routine  It feels real every times  I want to miss my mom  but I don't remember the real her  All I remember is her disease and the torment  And how she looked when I found her  Just typing that last sentence was hard   I feel like shit for not being upset with her death  She was torturing me and her life itself was torture  she wanted to die so bad   Hell  I'd probably have killed myself if she hadn't died   Now I'm happy with my high school sweetheart and we're getting married and he holds me when I have attacks and takes such good care of me  Tl dr  orphan kid suffers greatly from now dead abusive mother

Take good care of yourself OP   Give a hug and you get a hug 
yeah i dont browse fb anymore I just use messenger for free sms
 hugs   I know you feel responsible for her suicide and consider yourself negligent in preventing it  but you don't deserve to carry this weight alone  You're going through your own issues just as she was  and in the end it was your sister that made up her mind to find an ending  and I feel like it would have been impossible to stop her regardless  It's difficult to avoid "could have" and "should have" thought patterns for sure  but I want you to know that while such statements may indeed be true   we all could have and should have done certain things that we never did   it is also true that we often don't have the level of control over others' actions that we think we do  I'm so sorry for your loss and for the pain you're going through  I hope that one day you will find peace and healing

I recently cut most caffeine out of my life  which has made a huge improvement in my anxiety and how I feel  I still drink decaf coffee because it's hard giving up coffee and the coffeehouse ritual completely  I only ever notice anything if I have two cups of decaf  
I met her at her party which a mutual friend invited me to  We were instantly interested in each other and I ended up staying with her for days after the party finished just talking about everything  We would talk all night and all day every waking moment I immediately felt sick with love for her  I had never spoken to anyone in my life so openly   I don't know why we ended we just kept finding ways to argue  She felt like I didn't care about her and I felt like she wasn't as in to me as she had been in the past so the last time she walked out I didn't call her and she never called me 
Fb has honestly played a big part in feeding my paranoia and depression and I deactivated it this morning and fuck I have been looking up at the world all day  Hopefully this lasts for a while and I can learn some more about this world and see the attraction to living    
Thank you 
Haha you don't sound weird  that's actually really interesting  I need to find some kind of hobby or something I'm interested in for sure   Not a bad idea to go to a cafe or something but it's so intimidating for me to sit somewhere alone  I'd probably end up just staring at my phone before leaving haha
Thank you for sharing your opinion  3
if she's intoxicated with social media then dont pretend to be ok with it  i aint gonna tell you to break up with her cause idk the full story but id recommend you have a serious talk with her  you'll know what to do then 
it really sucks when you have to remind someone to look up from their phones    props to u for deleting that shit

Im 44 and 6 feet tall yet kids make my anxious  Its because they dont have a filter yet and will say anything    Kids learn by pushing boundaries which is why he threw the ball at you anyway but lightly  to see if he could get away with it  The problem is that depending on the parents they might not approve of you "teaching" their child so it leaves you in an awkward spot    In your example is sounds like the parents are the problem as this kid is disrespectful to everyone 
relatable as hell 
Used to have severe vertigo  Started taking OTC magnesium because I was low on blood tests  Lots of praying went into the magnesium  It has quite literally negated my vertigo issues  Though  they're big ass pills  I could barely change oil in my vehicle  or have my teeth cleaned  Because as soon as I looked up it would set off an attack  After taking magnesium for nearly a year and a half  praying that stuff actually works  it finally left  I still have minor attacks sometimes  
fuck yeah

I relate to some of the things you mentioned  I think about things I worry about pretty much literally 24 7 and sometimes if it's really bad my brain will feel like it's literally tired or strained  Like the muscles in my brain are tensing up or something  I think odds are I just stress myself out so much to the point I give myself a mild headache from time to time  I can also relate to the hair pulling  something I rarely do but am trying to stop at any rate  Whenever I get violent thoughts they usually revolve around myself  but I've definitely been through your situation of imaging them happening to other people and it sucks  it's awful  For me when it comes to reading I tend to feel like I didn't fully comprehend a sentence I read because my mind is always going a hundred miles an hour so I'll read the same line over and over again until I feel sure that I understood exactly what it said    I don't really have any great advice since I'm kind of in the same boat as you  But I just wanted you to know you're definitely not alone in this kind of stuff  What I'm going to try to do is do more things that are beneficial for me  I find I feel really great after I exercise  Like  it sucks during the actual exercise but once I finish I feel all this adrenaline and I feel really proud of myself for accomplishing something even if it's small  My brother was also kind enough to loan me a book on anxiety that I'm going to genuinely try to finish instead of just read the first few pages like I normally do with self help books  And lastly I'm gonna give meditation a try  I think it's helpful to just try to clear your mind of all the junk your ocd is trying to feed you all day and let your body just exist for a moment in peace  Not saying you've gotta do all those things  but those are always options  Seeing a therapist if you're not already could also really help  although I haven't exactly taken my own advice on that yet  Sorry this comment was so long but best of luck 
These comments mean the world to her and me  thank you too 
From my experience It's been a year and I still haven't gotten over anything  New Years Eve I freaked because I saw a pic of my ex and her current boyfriend  It still hurts for me  After a year my pathetic ass can't get over her  Everyones different though  Most people say it takes time and that might help  In my opinion looking for someone new to replace old feelings would probably help a lot to  My ex did it and shes having the time of her life now  Hanging out with friends to get your mind off the situation helps  It's definitely ok to be sad but its important that you start the process of moving forward  
Thank you for sharing   We often discuss my past but i don't really have a reason for PTSD  My life hasn't had any really high impact negative events  It's been more a boring pointless slog 
Legit just deactivated my fb which is weird for me because I'm on it all the time and my best friend in the whole world messages me asked me if I'm ok  I say "no I'm really not ok"  She messaged back with "fair enough"  This is someone who says they would do anything for me and be here for me no matter what  Someone I have on countless times dropped my whole life in a minute to help her out and all I get is fair enough    come on    friends are shit and actions speak louder than words  
For me personally I think I make myself feel very ostracized rather than me actually ostracized  I've pretty shitty self esteem so even in groups of friends I enjoy being with I tend to think things like "you're so pathetic  why would anyone want to be your friend  they'd have a much better time if you weren't around" or "you think anyone actually wants to hang out with you  you should have just stayed home"    I did go through a pretty rough patch in late high school  I'd move from a town where I'd lived for 7 years and had many friends  I moved three times in one school year and had a lot of trouble making new friends  To add salt to the wound  all the wonderful friends I thought I had back at my old home never did much on their part to keep in touch  Only one of them kept in touch and it really hurt me because it made me feel like none of them ever really considered me that good of a friend after all  I'm not sure if it could cause the onset of OCD symptoms  It's always possible  Even if it didn't cause the initial onset  that's a very stressful and emotionally straining situation to be in  so I feel sure it could definitely worsen or flare up OCD symptoms  
Thanks for the advice  I mean I understand I won't die or anything from ring worm  Being on the road and last night in a hotel I have felt really out of my element I guess and everything has been stressing me out more than usual    I know I have to face my fears eventually  But I'm not sure I'm strong enough right now lol  But I'll try to hopefully  Thanks for the response again  
My New Years resolution make it until Saturday when I can finally get back to my psychiatrist    Long term resolutions overwhelm me haha I might just start having new week resolutions 
Yeah  it feels like most of the time people don't even mean it  That's why I stopped asking it unless I really want to know the answer  So most of the times I ask  it's with a close friend  It would be nice to live in a society where you could answer honestly and not be judged for it  where people would care instead of distancing themselves 
One of the worst guilt I've ever felt probably came from my violent obsessions  I knew I didn't want to act on any of them  even if I was angry  but I still felt like a horrible person  Like  "what kind of daughter has thoughts about doing horribly violent things to her parents "  The violent thoughts grew from me fearing hurt people to just picturing violent things in general and it got so bad I just didn't want to leave my house or even my room  I felt terrified but also very emotionally numb  It's probably one of the worst places I've been in my life when it comes to my ocd  Thankfully it hasn't been quite that bad in a while  as far as the violent thoughts at least

       that small connection can sometimes be the thing to make you keep going   Exactly this   
Thank you 
The last girl I dated  I was 19 years old  I did not understand this sickness at all at that point and I was having a major episode one day  she ended up calling me a "pussy " I'll never forget it    The issue with people yelling is it is in a lot of people's personality  That is just kind of the way they know they can get people's attention  Some people  let's say athletes  respond very well to yelling    But then there is people like you and me and probably everyone else reading this that respond so negatively to yelling  that it ruins our days and potentially our weeks  It takes something out of us    We ain't alone yo  
That's pretty much my viewpoint as well  no bad kids  just bad parents  As I said though  what gets to me more  is that I can't command respect 
I'm kind of in the same place  I used to have super bad harm thoughts which gave me super super bad anxiety and depression  Now whenever I have them it's almost like I brush them off  but I think that's just because my mind is giving priority of sorts to my more dominant obsessions  But honestly  the fact that you're freaking out about it is a pretty good indicator that you have no actual will to act on your thoughts and never will  Just keep in mind ocd is a pesky little thing  likes to play tricks on you and the things you most never want to do  Yeah  it's gonna find some way to make you think you actually do  ocd's mean like that 
Congrats on going  My visit was very simple  I noted on my paper that I was having depression and anxiety issues  they had me fill out a form before I came back so that they knew what the visit was about   and I explained my issues to my doc  at which point I was prescribed anti anxiety medication that changed my life for the better    pretty simple stuff 
Your post reads like a classic example of Borderline Personality Disordered abuse  It can be very confusing  please don't blame yourself  I am  unfortunately  not skilled with words  But if you post there  Im sure someone will give the advice you need 
Yeah this makes sense  Now after sleeping some and thinking about it  I understand ringworm isn't very dangerous  It's curable and everything  Also my family who has it is acting very normal  they aren't nervous at all    I'm still by far the most nervous in my family about getting ringworm but I'm trying to get over that fear  Once home  there isn't much I can do  But my state of mind right now is if I continue performing tasks  there is a chance I won't get ringworm still  I don't know I'm pretty sure I'm freaking out over nothing but you know how it is lol  Thank you for the response though  
Thank you  I have gotten the post up over there  She has tried to say that I am bi polar on top of my depression  even though my therapist said otherwise 
i stopped using facebook years ago   hands down one of the best decisions i made in my entire life  
As someone older than you  life at your age can change very quickly in a year  Which can also seem like an eternity when you are depressed  but I assure you it happens    Finding purpose in life is fluid  It changes and often purpose isn't clear until after we have fulfilled it  Start small  Who would be sad without you  Your mother   Your purpose is to simply be you  the person they love  to exist  Do you have a pet  Your purpose is to care and feed them  Life makes us believe we have to make millions and be famous or change the world to have purpose  Ultimately  getting up everyday and fighting a good fight is enough 
Sorry to hear that  if she was already leaving then coming back  then it was going to happen  Best of luck 
As a server  I totally feel this 
OMG same here   I act so weird whenever I'm anxious people wonder what's wrong with me 
I would definitely recommend it  it made me feel a lot more comfortable with staying on my meds  I also did a lot of digging on PubMed  but the research published on lithium exposure isn't very extensive because it's obviously hard to test in any way other than self reported studies  The biggest risk seems to be a heart valve defect  but like I said  the doctors I saw aren't convinced that the incidence of that is actually any higher than the general population  I believe risk is dose dependent though  so that might be work talking to MFM about  I take 600mg day  also take lamictal and risperidone   
just noticed your username  chuckled a little  cheers m8
While I certainly understand the aggravation and anxiety this caused you   I also suffer from OCD  you have to realize a lot of these things are considered normal behavior  outside he toothpaste spit  She had no idea a lot of those common things would cause you a level of anxiety she honestly has never experienced    In a positive turn    you made it through it   All those things you deem dangerous didn't get you  This was a great exercise in exposure for you    Just remember your sister most likely didn't do anything on purpose  
Whenever I drink I tend to drink with a group of close friends  I can't bring myself to drink around a large group of people with maybe only one good friend since I have diabetes  and have constant anxiety that the alcohol might effect my blood sugar dangerously  But with a group of friends I know I can trust I always drink enough that I get decently drunk  Personally for me whenever I drink everything is pretty great for the most part  I feel relaxed and happy and like dancing around  not a single worry on my mind  Once things calm down a bit I tend to get slightly depressed but it's nothing too bad  I've found however that I do obsess a lot on things I did or said when drunk  I'll dwell and dwell worrying that my actions have a reflection on my sober self  even though I could never imagine my sober self doing or saying half the things I do or say when I'm drunk  But it's hard to disconnect it  you know  When you're constantly uncertain about what you really want  sometimes getting drunk isn't the best thing  
Hahaha  Thanks  Yeah I mean I see nothing else that could help me  I really want to be normal again  Hoping cbt will be the way to go  At the end of the day I keep thinking about how I was before 2014 and looking at my self now I just ask myself "how did this happen "  Damn hope that guy is doing alright    Exactly  Whenever I tell someone the duration of my suffering they just act shocked  It's literally in overdrive and I want this to go away before I completely isolate myself from everyone everything  I can slowly feel it happening    Yeah when I get into bed I feel sane again  Which is why I have a hard time getting out of bed  Takes me a good 20 mins or so to mentally prepare myself that I have go out of my room  Yup even 30 seconds peace is a gift from God  But I would only get that peace once in bed     Thanks for your comment mate  It's good just to talk about this to people who are in the same boat as me   
Already ahead of you  My life has been so quiet and nearly drama free this past 5 months  Gave me time to focus on myself and not be afraid to be myself   Also no more snide comments     Now the only thing keeping me down is myself and my job  Today is a horrible day for me at work  I got stuck in the snow and apparently the tow truck jerked my pallets around in my trailer  Grapes everywhere     
Thank you for the advice  I thought about it a lot off and on the last couple of days  I know that I need to do something for myself besides just telling my boyfriend  as good of a support as he is  This sounds silly but I am almost scared to make a call like that because it means admitting it to myself  if that makes sense  I don't know if I am ready to  I feel that I am in a better place having told someone and that like I said  I know I need to make a move for myself  which I am okay with right now    Right now  I think I am in a spot where I feel okay with setting up an appointment with a doctor and getting back on medication  I was taking something for both my depression and anxiety  although it mostly just curbed the overwhelming thoughts that I didn't leave something on and made interactions with people a little bit easier by freeing me from obsessing over what I said  If I feel comfortable with the Doctor  I might talk to them about how low I felt  For some reason that is easier than calling    I do think that knowing what you should do and having training does make it harder and I totally agree that it is more isolating  I feel like it makes you feel more guilty by not doing something because everyone knows that you "know better"  I get the thing with the meds too  It is so so so easy to think that they aren't working or needed any more and quiet them  It is like the 2nd or 3rd time I have stopped  although I think it has been 4 or 5 months since I stopped  Now that I think about it too  I had a hard time feeling weak for needing to take them    I had a really awful ex that made me feel that way about needing help and I think some it stuck around after leaving him     I am a bit confused though  what did you mean by saying that "They say you are supposed to"  That you are supposed to quit them or want to 
Same for me putting things down  I need the "just right" feeling or I'll constantly keep picking something up and putting it back down until it does  It sucks when it happens in front of people because then I don't want anyone to notice and think I'm weird so I'll stop sooner than I normally would and don't always get that "just right" feeling  
people here dont need saving and then two days later you can see 20 posts about how no one is helping them 
Cooking eh  I dont know jack shit in cooking haha  All i know what to cook is an omelet  Do you have any interests in becoming a chef  You can turn your hobbies into happy realities ye know     What games do you play by the way  Do you have steam  We can play some games together if you wanna  
NAMI and DBSA both have meetings that might be near you and people have suggested meetup com    BUT   if internet friends will do  the skype chat in the sidebar has been excellent for keeping me company and helping me feel normal and understood  It's an online support group  so that helps me at least  Shoot me a pm and I'll send you a link to join 
Anger is also a form of depression  Which is why I don't get bent out of shape bc sum1 is probably as far down the rabbit hole as I am 
I only use Facebook to   judge new pictures that girls I went to high school with put up  Literally the only reason why I still have it up 
That site never helped with my social anxiety  Since I deleted it  I have read more  watched more movies and slowly getting my garage ready for woodworking  
you ever have those days where you can't do anything else except focus on how shit you feel  that 
Me too  These aren't real people  They are just the mask people want you to see 
I'd call the police    They record the conversations I think right  Those people need to be fired before they get anyone killed   I'm so sorry that happened to you  
Same thing happened to me  She was acting like talking to me was really getting in the way of whatever else she had to be doing 
thing is  you are not really gonna keep in touch  You'll see their pictures  but everyone knows you only show the good   And you're not gonna talk with them much  At some point  it'll only be "happy birthday"  which they forgot but FB reminded them 
I do talk a lot so if you want to skip to the pretty bit it starts around 7 30   
Was raped a lot growing up
I was diagnosed with anxiety a couple of weeks ago  They have prescribed me Etizolam  Since the diagnosis  even before I had begun my medication  I used to feel extremely dizzy and nauseous  Once I started taking the medication  I have been getting random spells of dizziness  but it is much better  I usually try to pull myself to the reality during these spells by doing something that interests me  like browsing  reading  watching funny videos  music etc  But yes  I do believe that dizziness is related to anxiety and depression 
Wow thank you for posting this  I was totally ignorant of "atypical" depression and thought I just had heavy limbs because I am a worthless human being   It did not occur to me that it might be a symptom of my longstanding depression    So     No advice  but if you do find that MAOIs or any supplements help you  I hope you will post again   
Here's how I dropped a large part of my negative thinking  I looked at it as "reverse narcissism"   Why should all these bad things happen to me or my loved ones  but I don't think they're going to happen to other people  I found myself doing mental gymnastics to imagine horrendous torrents of events occuring to myself and I realized that I was singling myself out   for better or worse   by imagining that I was going to be the victim of these bad events  I was acting like I was the center of the universe  but for bad stuff    Look into the concepts of CBT and mindfulness  which is not so much an attempt to "think positive" as it is a method of eliminating regretting the past or being anxious of the future

Thanks
I still struggle with believing negative thoughts much more easily than positive ones  i still feel as though it's what I'm meant to do  I feel like I'm supposed to have a negative view of myself   But what helped me was thinking positive thoughts that were actually true or believable rather than something big  Grand positive thoughts made me feel worse  so thoughts like  I am beautiful  I am enough  I am going to be ok were just too big  Smaller thoughts or thoughts I knew to be true were better like  I have a safe place to sleep at night  I am fighting my anxiety depression  These thoughts didn't contradict my negative views so they were easier to introduce into my thought pattern  And then I was able to use this as a base to introduce more positive thoughts  bigger thoughts that really gave me a more positive outlook  
Please don't feel that way because evidently the people at the other end was the shitty and worthless one  I mean they're supposed to be trained counsellors and not be a judgemental b  Anyway  like what many others would say  vent it out  this sub is always open and available  
This is something that I want to do  slowly weening myself off of social media  Not good  especially when I constantly compare myself to others and look at my old friends posts
Yeah the idea of getting therapy can be scary  And lots of people feel like their problems aren't proper problems  and that they should just suck it up or whatever  But I can assure you that your therapist isn't going to say anything horrible like that  I mean that would just be dickish and help precisely nobody  Their job is to help you  not to put you down  I'm just some random guy on the internet  so all I can do is encourage you  go for it  You've already managed a first step that lots of people don't  by deciding that you want to see a therapist  You can do the next one  too 
so accurate 
I think you might have dysthimia  
 removed 
Thank you for the reply  I had tried betablockers but they just really made me feel terrible  then I was put on Citalopram and have been on that for about 4 months now  Strange thing is  the dosage does not seem to run parallel with the dizziness either  Maybe it's time for me to try a different medication again  
That's good  You can go back to college in the future but sometimes you have limited time to find a lasting job  Nice  
Just tell your doctor exactly what you said here  maybe add at the end something like "I think I have some sort of depression or something  like dysthimia or some stuff" 
Good on you  I did the same thing  What work will you be looking for  I'm looking for some as well

 because apparently  they are very racist to foreigners in Iran    uh huh  no     In the 1990s  Iran sheltered a staggering 4 5 million exiles from Afghanistan and Iraq  the largest refugee caseload any single country has handled in modern times  The numbers have shrunk in the last few years to slightly more than two million people  but that figure is still twice as high as anywhere else  And because of the unsettled regional political and military situation  Teheran may have to continue to shoulder this burden for some time to come   The Afghans received heavily subsidized state food  health and education packages and many refugees  including women  found local employment    http   www unhcr org en us publications refugeemag 3b6814092 refugees magazine issue 108 afghanistan unending crisis iranian surprise html
Good luck mate  Keep reminding yourself of how important this one thing is  and keep your focus on that  Fuck the depression  keep getting up when it knocks you down 
Your writing is beautiful and you're using a tone that reminds me of my own  combining opposites  e g  wisdom and folly   It's a delight to read  even if it was inspired by unhappy feelings  I loved your choice of words in "diurnal mourning " too  it's beautiful and I never would have thought of that   And it sucks to be inpatient this time of year  I at least made it past new year's day before I ended up inpatient  but I'm pretty sure I spent valentines day in a psych hospital  I was in love at the time  
Consider buying homeworkouts on DVD along with some adjustable dumbbells   The advantage of getting a DVD workout is that the onscreen instructor will tell you about good form   If what you want is strength training  since you mention bodybuilding  a few good DVD instruction workouts include  P90X or P90X3  these ones use a pull up bar in addition to dumbbells  Rushfit  martial arts combined with endurance strength training  Body Beast  more traditional bodybuilding I think  uses dumbbells and pull up bar and bench  And MOSSA  which is coming out on DVD soon   I know it because it used to be available on XBox  fun workouts for beginner or intermediate  some martial arts and some weights workouts   If you buy adjustable dumbbells  there are two types  standard size or Olympic size  It is important to make this decision first because the weight plates fit either one or the other size but not both  Olympic size has a higher weight limit and the handle is thicker  Find out highest limit  and decide based on that whether you will ever need Olympic or if standard is enough for you  If your long term goal is very heavy weight  then you could decide on Olympic from beginning   The plates can be reused for barbells in the future  but I read recommendation to start with dumbbells for 1 3 years before moving to barbell  Once you decide on size  you can buy a bunch of plates of different weights to gradually attach to your dumbbells    Start low weight  and increase very gradually  for example every 2 3 weeks increase by smallest possible amount     I recommend getting more than one set of handles for dumbbells so you can have two or three different sizes prepared for your workout and don't need to take time to switch plates during the workout  For some muscles you will be able to use heavier dumbbells than for others   An important thing to keep in mind  if you do strength training with weights  do not exercise same muscles two days in a row  Plan to let the muscle rest for 48 hours before working same muscle again  Either alternate lower body days and upper body days  or alternate strength and cardio workouts 
Yes its sad realizing that time never stops  I know what you mean 
Going through this right now  Based on the recommendations of my PCP  P Doc  and Pharmacists I'm switching over from the lithium   clonazepam combo to Latuda  Hopefully this helps 
30yo and have had feelings similar to what you describe for the past 15 years  Talking to anybody can help  If you're still in education there are services available that might be able to help  In my experience they weren't great but I took what I could from it and moved on  Don't force yourself through somebody else's process  find what works for you   I currently see a private therapist but I'm still deciding if it is going to work for me    Something that I have found helpful in the past is to try disconnecting for periods of time  Just a few hours a week  No distractions from tech or online or other people  Even music  Use the time to work on yourself or explore your thoughts and feelings on paper  It sounds lame and it can honestly be pretty terrifying but if it helps you to understand yourself more it will be worth it  Just remember that it is for you  Be cautious about sharing it  
Thats fascinating  I wonder if thats why i have a addictive personality 
No  you shouldn't have to deal with that  Tell him  that's disgusting  I had a roommate that never washed  same thing  smelly feet  never washed clothes  It was vile  It's not asking to much to live in a place without constant body odor  
You've endured so much  and you've accomplished so much  You're strong  I also have PTSD due to growing up with a lot of physical and mental emotional abuse  Feel free to message me if you ever would like to talk    
Man  take it easy    Focus on an objective  not on the status  You made this post to get something off your chest and now i'm giving you the feedback you want to hear  That is the purpose of your post  to talk and exchange ideas  it is irrelevant whether it gets upvotes or not 
i know that feeling perfectly well  but im trying to do something with gaming  or atleast something that touches the world of games  you could try to do youtube for a living and build up some confidence  and try focusing on school if the YouTube plan wont work  do have patience with YouTube tho  well just some suggestions whatever you wanna do after reading this is still up to you bro
thanks man I feel like they will say nothing is wrong and I'm wasting my life and now to tell my parents the next scary step
Thank you for your advice  Yeah I don't want to take them as apparently they can cause insomnia and my sleeping pattern is already pretty messed up  which can't be helping my SA  I don't think they will particularly help so until I've given therapy a go  I'm holding out  Happy new year and the same to you 
I'm actually switching off Latuda soon for some problems it's causing me  But my experience has been mostly positive 
Diagnosing yourself by listening to random strangers on the internet is more than iffy  obviously  but to me it seems like you are checking a whole bunch of depression boxes there  yeah  Feelings of being stuck  lack of perspective for the future  finding it really difficult and exhausting to do normal things  feeling inferior or even worthless  those are all things that sound like depression to me   You mentioned that you're in uni  Have you checked whether your university has a psychological counseling type of thing  It's not the same as therapy  but I thought it was really helpful  Maybe you could also see if there are any self help type groups in your city 
It can still be a great year  These feelings are inevitable when you have depression  I was super depressed when the new year struck  but i still have long term goals for the year that I am excited about  that I know will help my mental health get better  Am I going to get severely depressed along the way  lose hope  and want to hurt myself again  I am sure I am  But does that mean I won't try my hardest to kick depression in the ass  Nope    I believe in every single one of you who feel so hopeless right now   You can do this  
Mate seriously  be proactive about it  If you let depression and anxeity be in the back of your head when you're trying study it's going to weigh you down  please put yourself first  Good luck 
That sucks   When it comes to tips  I think it's good to not set your bar too high  To recognize that even going outside for a bit is a step forward  It's common to get stuck in some sort of absolutist mindset where either everything is as it was before or it's hopeless  So I guess just focus on getting your everyday routines in order regarding sleep  and force yourself to just go outside  doesn't have to be anything big 
Small amounts of chocolate don't contain much caffeine  it's about 3 mg or less for 10 g of milk chocolate  and 7 7 mg to 19 8 mg for dark chocolate  with the dark one having the most  according to  this  http   www amanochocolate com articles how much caffeine is in chocolate   
Agreed abort it asap if you're even questioning wanting it   A child is the last thing you need right now 
I just made an account to tell you  that hopefully everything will be ok with your life  Taking your life is not a solution  you are not the reason your parents are splitting up  I know this hurts  but remember that time heals all wounds and hopefully this will make you stronger   Power through this  I can you can find some power to get through this  
For obvious reasons I can't say exactly what happened  I've spent major parts of my life trying to help this person  but eventually got rejected hard when I thought we were friends 
 removed 
Please don't even think about killing yourself  Parents splitting up really sucks and you have every right to feel sad angry about it  just try to cope with it  it will get better eventually  It might even be an opportunity for them to start over and be happier than they are now    it takes time of course  it's like a grieving process i guess
Ugh  I know the type
Not really  Only online support for those matters  It matters though  I had therapy but felt that the therapist was not much help and was not at the same wave lenght in understanding  as I did not feel understood  However thanks for listening  kind stranger
Same    I got yelled at for everything I did growing up  And my step dad did crazy shit like putting cameras in our bedrooms  When I was somewhat social he would listen in on my phone calls and read my text messages  Wasn't allowed to have friends  Now my whole life is just wake up   browse internet   sleep   repeat  I can't talk to anyone 
Don't expect too much of yourself  Education can always be returned to  never forget that  If it gets too much for you  so be it  Try your best but don't allow yourself to suffer as in the end your health is much more valuable  Utilise the people studying with you and teachers  ask for help when you need it and make sure you have time to yourself away from your school work   Best of luck to you  You can do it 
I have  I'm still a teen but i have no idea how to act around younger kids it's awkward  For example  when they stare at me i know it's because i'm ugly which makes me uncomfortable or when they harass me physically i don't know what to do  do i just yell at them with the mom right there  do i ignore it  I can relate to what you say 
I was going to suggest this as well  If your area does not have one  start one  It isn't too hard  You might be able to find  with the help of this website  a mental health advocate in your area  
If it's due to anxiety you shouldn't get fined  I'm guessing you're not going out having fun instead of going to school  so you're fine  Anxiety sucks  I'm sorry it's kicking your ass 
Thank you so much I appreciate it 
They're definitely not gonna say that  I mean  you're probably sick of hearing this  but you're 16  You've got most of your life ahead of you  man  If anything  look at it like this  getting serious about caring for your mental health at such a young age is gonna give you a head start  Learning techniques for dealing with shitty feelings and limiting behavior patterns and so on is something I know for a fact lots of people wish they had done earlier in life    And yeah  haha  I'm practically a dinosaur compared to you and talking to my parents about how I needed therapy was scary as hell  Took me forever to muster up the courage  But you know what  They were really great and supportive about it  You can do this 
Yeah  I can understand even that 
 removed 
Thanks and yeah I live had a bad day 
Happy birthday  mate  I hope you feel better 
I totally understand what you are feeling  There is something about finding people who get you on a certain level where you don't feel like you have to explain things  This might take time  These people are around  you just need to uncover them and it will take some time      I do have a best friend that I met in my late 30's who isn't bipolar but understands me as if she was bipolar  There are some of those folks around      You might want to get involves with some groups that represent some hobbies and interests you have  I also think looking into the NAMI website as people have suggested is helpful  
thanks man you are the nicest person I have met on this site and I will get back to you after my therapy  thank you  
What are your exams 
I hope you'll feel better soon  happy birthday  
Good for you  My similar experience was finally going to the local dnd club  Now i go almost every weekend 
Dude  suicidal thoughts are never far from my mind  even when going through a good patch  I kind of think of it as though I'm hard wired that way  even with a whole bunch of new circuitry that single one remains   I know this is going to be a contradiction  but I don't think suicidal thoughts like these necessarily mean you want to complete a suicide  I just think your brain has trained itself that way  At least thats how I've rationalised it for myself 
Anxiety is not a mind set  It comes from being around douche bags 
You are not to blame for any of that happening  You are not a bad person  You are someone who was brave enough to reach out in a desperate time and you got treated like shit by people who are supposed to help you  That's entirely their fault and nothing you should feel ashamed of    Please don't let this stop you from reaching out again because a person on the other end of the phone who actually knows what they're doing can make a big difference  I'm sorry that they treated you like that though

I've been on Effexor XR 150mg  started with 75mg  since summer but it has yet to show any effect on me  or maybe I didn't notice   We are still patiently waiting  I hope we can find a medication that works for me soon because I really can't stand living and might go for ending my life at this rate 
I find that I often want to help people but I'm in such a delicate state myself that if I were to get one thing wrong and cause damage I wouldn't be able to bear it  I read every single post on this subreddit but don't respond to them all  and I'm sure many other people do too 
Personally  suicidal ideation is a way to exercise a feeling of control when things in life seem out of control  When you know you can fold the cards and leave the table whenever you want  losing doesn't sting as much  But I would had preferred of not getting dragged to play this game in the first place 
There is no undoing what he did  Half hearted apologies are not going to take away from the fact that he broke serious boundaries and severely damaged your trust in him    I know it will be painful and difficult  but I would really consider ending the relationship 
I was on Sertralin  Zoloft  50mg for about a year  Till I felt better and took myself off it  Bad idea  I loved it but people said it made me very bland and neutral   Then went on to citalopram which was OK but didn't really do much    Now I'm off everything  moved abroad and cant get to a docs  its not too bad  Have my off days but its sunnier and more relaxed here which helps my mental health  
oh no  don't do that  have you tried other meds  I know cymbalata worked amazing for me  but my insurance no longer covers it for me unfortunately 
Trintellix   Mirtazapine would be a good antidepressant combination to antagonise 5 HT receptors known to have antidepressant effect  5 HT2A 2C 3 7  and Alpha 2 adrenergic receptors   The only downside with Mirtazapine is that it's a potent H 1 antagonist which causes drowsiness and sedation  Some say it subsides over time while others say it never truly goes away  It's also a weak mAChRs antagonist  670nM   It's claimed to have negligible anticholinergic effects but I'm skeptical since Abilify's mAChRs antagonism is in the 1000's but it's still considered to have  ACB Scale of 1  http   www agingbraincare org uploads products ACB scale   legal size pdf   So although Mirtazapine hasn't been tested  it could potentially have ACB scale of 2 which is concerning   Another downside with Trintellix   Mirtazapine is that it's missing the NRI part  Unless if Mirtazapine's Alpha 2 adrenergic antagonism can make up for that   While Nortriptyline has a nice pharmacologic profile  I feel like its mAChRs antagonism  40nM  is too potent for me to want to try it    So I'm currently leaning towards Trintellix   Mirtazapine or Reboxetine 
This is fantastic  I have anxiety  and know how hard things can become    Really proud of you 
yeah I think so too  It's how my brain works  I'm not that worried that it's dangerous for me  It sort of bums me out though  I feel disappointed with myself 
I haven't gotten to the point of deciding to get pregnant but have discussed it with my pdoc  hypothetically  and he said if I was to go that route that I should be seeing a "high risk obgyn " Kind of made sense to me given the whole med issue  I have the same fears regarding meds  Also i would drive myself crazy trying to figure all of that out  There is probably a specialist or a psychiatrist you could consult with to plan a pregnancy  
I thought this year would be a new start but then I realised just because the year has changed doesn't mean my illness has magically disappeared  
I was on Zoloft to but then it stopped working  I had brain zaps when I got off of it  My bf is citalopram  which I feel like isn't the best antidepressant  but that's just my opinion  maybe he needs a higher dosage  but how did you get off of everything  that is what I would love to do  are you on any supplements to help 
You know yourself better than anyone here  so you'll have to just figure out whether or not it will be better for you  Personally  weed helps my anxiety depression immensely but it  can  get to a point where it's no longer doing me any good  It can make me hungry  and make me wanna eat which can be very bad  but at the same time it can ease my anxieties going into social situations and allow me to relax and feel better  I don't know your history so decide for yourself  ya know  Is it at a point where it's going to help you process your emotions and help you get better  Or does it have negative effects 
Chocolate can have quite a bit of caffeine and other stimulants in it 
Congrats  Are you Dutch by any chance  I noticed you spelled "Success" with only one "s"    
I'm sorry you had such a horrible experience  I never called one of these before but I was considering calling a hotline when I hit a serious low point a few weeks ago  Well  this just goes to show that it seems like not calling wasn't such a bad thing after all 
Yep  8 months and I just want to kill myself for being an unlovable shit  
Force yourself to contact a few of the people you're avoiding  the ones who you really like  I know it's painful to feel useless and a failure  but everyone does at some point or another  although depression is pretty much feeling it 24 7   People close to you will understand if you're going through a rough patch  Having a minimum of social interaction goes a long way   Personally  I just send a quick message and go from there  I also try to go out and get groceries on specific days to develop a routine  
I know the feelings you describe   I am 6 years on from a life changing ruining   career ending and multiple relationship  ending series of manic episodes   It has been really hard to move on but as someone else commented I just try to keep moving forward  People always have   a hard time separating me from my illness   That includes me  I just wanted to say that it gets easier even if it doesnt go away completely and realise that you are not alone feeling like this  You are not alone 
Thanks a lot  It's definitely of great help  If you don't mind  what is the book you're reading  I myself go through karnegie's 'how to win friends  etc' because my social skills gone really awful  And I feel stress relieved when I use techniques from the book while communicating with people  Thanks a lot for your reply and good luck to you 
I'm glad you think so 
Seriously been going through the exact same thing while here on Winter break  But you know what  I went back to school to celebrate NYE and I loved it  Sure now I am back at home  but I know more good times will come in the future  That kind of put me at ease and now there isn't much pressure when I am home to make plans with old friends  But that's my situation  if you ever wanna vent about yours or just talk about random shit  don't hesitate to hit me with a pm 
Yes  that's something to consider  Thanks a lot for your comment  
You just have to stop giving a damn  Realize it was your illness spiraling you out of control and you are presently healing and learning to live with it  We all have some embarassing  "crazy" episodes with this illness unfortunately  You are not the first person in the world nor the last to act erraticly  Focus on your future 
Same for me  The worst part is when you assume that someone is lonely and you start to develop some kind of sympathy for that person that you don't even know  or barely know  because you believe that this person would understand what you feel  Then  his her girlfriend boyfriend friend family member  comes in  they start to have fun and you feel like the only lonely person on the planet  At least that's how it ends for me 
You aren't alone  I feel many of the things you do  Even got a bad back because of an accident  because why not add that to my list of problems     I'm impressed at the effort you put into improving yourself  Seriously  that's awesome  Just do those things for yourself  I hate a lot of things about myself too  but I keep working at it  I don't know what difference it'll make  and I try not to think about the future too much  I just focus on the present and try to shut out the negative thoughts 
The first one is Calculus then Modern Physics then Java 
So maybe it is situational  but getting help could still be very useful  would you consider seeing a therapist 
I honestly don't know at this point
I've been there  It sure is depressing  Have you gone to councilling 
I know it's easy to just say this  but you have no reason to feel disappointed  you can't get upset at your own chemistry  I go through the same thing  with suicidal thoughts and other aspects of my depression  and even though I can't just stop myself feeling guilty or disappointed I always try to logic it out and keep in mind that I can't alter my biology  Easier said than done  I know    
How about doing the opposite  Instead of pushing him off you grab him harder  Reach out to him instead of pushing him away  Not sure if talking to him in such detail would be helpful it might freak him out

Face my fears regularly  
I get this  too  It's one of those anxiety feedback loops  The stress of being very anxious causes those overwhelming emotions  which makes us more anxious     Try not to give weight to them  They may feel very real and genuine  but their cause is chemical  It's the hormonal stress response that is creating them   
As difficult as it is you need to stop analyzing it  It will drive you crazy  You are not an awful person for this  our minds spit out like 40 000 thoughts a day and every one of them is not going to represent you as a person  so disregard that thought as it is not evidence that you are awful  Your friend was not harmed touched  there is no harm done  try your best to stop thinking about it   
Okay mate  message me specific problems and I can help with them  and if I can't I'll get someone else to give me a hand  It's been a while since I programmed and I used another language so I'll get in touch with an IT friend for you  But  you need to set yourself some achievable targets right now  even if it's just a single page  You can't say  'today I will learn all the math ' because you won't achieve that and then you'll want to say fuck it to the rest of the studying  Making the targets small also helps with attitude  because even if you're feeling really down you can usually motivate yourself to do something if you know it's easy to achieve 
Yeah it's an amphetamine  Ya you probably wouldn't want to take it if you have heart problems 
This goes against everything   everything  a hotline would do   Call them back  and tell them what happened  This is not the way it should go  You also may want to read the  hotline FAQ  http   redd it 1c7ntr  from  r SuicideWatch  specifically        I called and it was a bad experience  I still need help  what do I do    Call back  and let the responder know what happened  Crisis intervention  especially if suicidality is a factor  is not easy  and not even the experts get it perfect every time  Personally  if I have a call go "south" on me  nothing makes me happier than to know that the person called back and had a better conversation with one of my colleagues    If you found yourself being rude or verbally abusive  apologize if you can  but either way try to hang in there with us  We understand that people in crisis struggle with self control  you don't need to be calm or businesslike but it really helps if you can show that you're trying your best to work with us    If you have a complaint about a hotline experience  please try to report it to the hotline administration    If you want to talk I'm here if you want  If you feel unsure about opening up to me you may want to look into my comment history to see if I'm 'OK'  You are not alone all right   hugs

Ya it seems to be helping  I still feel down sometimes when I haven't slept right though 
I think you should wait more  like 2 3 months since you stopped  Weed usually take 2 3 months to be flushed out of your body  It's normal you feel like shit and it doesnt change anything because you're still in withdrawal  Keep up the good work and you'll see the benefit soon  
You should absolutely ask her out  You only get one life to live and you never want to wonder about "what if"  You always want to be unique and separate yourself from the pack when it comes to women and truthfully one of the best ways to do that is to simply ask her out in a direct manner  something that not many guys are able to do  Do not be one of those guys that my buddy and I have called "spec ops"  those guys that have this massive agenda from the start and try to weasel their way into a girls pants one year at a time  If you get rejected don't dwell on it because the energy that you spend thinking about her and the rejection is time that you could have used to meet and ask out another woman  Good luck  
even if you feel like you don't want to do it  just deactivate your account  hey  you can always re activate it  I felt the same exact way as you but after I deleted it  I knew I wasn't going to regret my decision  
This couldn't possibly be more inaccurate  As a former hotline worker  at my call center  we were all volunteers  The people who are there have gone through hours and hours of training and are donating their time to help people in need    
Whether or not calls are recorded depends on the state  in some states its illegal to record calls without consent  in others you can   
I really relate  thank god someone feels the same way
Thank you  you're right it does help to think of it in that way  I spent so many years pushing and pushing myself and that's done more harm than good  approaching the anxiety differently and at my own pace is a much more hopeful way forward  
I don't have a specific problem with understanding math  The problem is that I can't get myself to sit down and study the lectures and answer the work sheets  If I just did this I am good for the exam  I just have to panic to start doing all the due shit   I just want to get out from this bad habit and motivate myself  I am always feeling down

The first step is getting through your grieving process  it's the toughest part but eventually you'll come out of the other end of that dark tunnel  After that take it one day at a time  reassure yourself that it's his loss and move on 
This is honestly super reassuring even on the opposite end  With my anxiety I always assume I am going to be judged because I am thin and it seems like I have no business being at the gym since I already am an ideal body weight    I'm terrified someone judging me because I don't need to exercise since I am either too thin or look fine so I should stop  Exercising helps me feel powerful and free and as though I can take on anything  Looks don't matter  it's the feeling more than anything 
Can I just tell you  you inspire me  I'm 26 years old  divorced once  remarried and struggle with doing anything for myself  I let fear control my life  I'm afraid to do anything alone    I screen captured this and will be using it for inspiration  You're amazing  
I got my anxiety from the majority of people around me being negative and treating me like shit  Now I'm almost 22 and missed out on so much life experience I'll probably never recover
Are you registered as a student with a disability   My school had resources for people struggling  I was offered to write my exams in a private room with no time limits  I was able to easily defer exams if I was unwell with my mental health  and they just generally accommodated what students needed  They offered note takers too  if attending or paying attention in class was difficult   My anxiety was bad   I ended up deferring a few exams and wrote them the following week  It was nice being registered though  because if I ever needed more help  I knew it was there   You can do this  Just take it one day at a time   
I'm sorry that you experience it too  but at the same time  it feels nice to know that I'm not the only one  I don't quite get flashbacks  but deja vu is the closest word experience that I can think of  but I didn't remember the word til you wrote it     I do the distractions to try to drown it out  Sometimes it works  and sometimes it doesn't  I wish I could find something that worked at least 90  of the time  but even combining activities  I'll often chew gum  squeeze silly putty in my left hand  color in an adult coloring book with my right hand  and have a "light" show going on  sometimes isn't enough  I've been working on the breathing too   After I posted this last night  I searched on youtube for emetophobia  There was a video where a girl described her fears and how she got past them  She said 2 things that really stuck with me  1  getting sick and throwing up isn't something that just happens out of the blue  it's a defense mechanism that your body has to get rid of bad stuff  And 2  what's going to happen is going to happen regardless of if you're afraid or not 
I'm battling a nasty cold too  It stinks even though I cannot smell  I feel like a failure since I had to take a break to let myself heal   But I know it's not the end  Because I chose to let my body heal it will perform better more quickly than if I didn't  There are more days ahead and missing a few doesn't negate the days I did exercise in the past  I'll do a little routine today to get back on track    Happy New Year 
I can relate to this because its been so relevant for me this year  Im approaching the end of university and that means that the real  adult world is barreling at me  In terms of my social life my social anxiety disorder is the best that its ever been and things are looking up  However  I am now coming to the realization that social anxiety disorder is going to have a profound impact on my professional life      I have only had one ever job that doesnt have anything to do with my field of study  Ive never had a big people job  My resume is empty  I have no network contacts at all  I have a mentor but am too afraid to contact him and im worried that hes angry with me    It just really sucks when you figure out out how to manage social anxiety in one area of your life but also figure out that its out of control in another

Don't apologize  it's not worth it  
Yep   that sounds very familiar for sure  I truly hope that you can communicate openly with him about it  If you truly think in your heart that he's someone to remain committed to  let him know you'll do anything before it's too late  And if it helps you to talk about it have you talked to a professional  
You know what depressed people need more of  Harsh criticisms  Harsh criticism will make everything better   sarcasm
i truly hope things get better for you    
No problem  I get sick a lot from stress  the only way I usually am sick  as it ruins my immune system  so I can completely understand 
Yes it does help to feel that we're not alone  I don't wish HA to anyone but it's great to have such a great community on Reddit
same here i think about more than one time a day  
What kind of jobs have you tried so far  Are there any kinds of jobs you know you wouldn't be able to do mentally or physically  And do you know what kind of boss worker customer groups you're looking to avoid or join specifically  These three questions can help form the base for your search if you want to begin looking for yourself  As for suggestions is a bit difficult without knowing you but here's 3 for funsies     "Movie theatre usher"   very easy most of the time  not much work for not much pay  but you won't have to deal with people outside easy directions inside a building or a hello     "Pizza delivery"   the biggest downside here is you need a car  after that the people you interact with will be hungry people  sometimes ass holes but you can't avoid that  relaxing in their own home and a few Co workers doing the same thing you are  Okay pay  and if you get tipped well you can make pretty good money     "Flight attendant"   you'd be dealing with a large group of people  a large portion of whom will likely be up their own ass  But the pay is solid and it gets you away from everything while you work  think mini vacations every trip you take   The hours are tough  but the possibility of fun and relaxation outside of literally being on the plane  are high     Hope I could help a little  any insight you would be willing to give might garner better advice   
Aw  I'm sorry about your relationship  I hope things work out well for you  
No worries  Thanks for your reply  Like I said where I am there is no form of support and to this day I think I am the only one here going through this    Yeah  Like going home for me at the end of the day is the worst coz I have to do all my rituals so I can go to bed   At time I'll just stay outside and not go home   If you don't mind me asking can you tell me about your cbt  Coz if it's not going to help I would like to know  I am going there with an open mind and still accepting that this will help me  I told my therapist not to put me on meds coz of the side effects  How is your experience with meds 
So sorry for you  I hope everything gets better 
i am on zyprexa it doesn't help much  
I think I speak for everyone here when I say we care about you and are here for you   If you ever need anyone to talk to  I'm here 
Even the small victories count  
That actually sounds like a neat experience  I sat home and spent NYE with family   and it was boring like every year  I think next year I might do what you did 
Happy Birthday  do yourself something nice today if you can      I wish you the best
Have you thought of trying something else  Never heard of zyprexa

I think that if the only motivation you have is to settle the situation in your mind  you should do it   Chances are your ex is fine and has come to terms with whatever happened   If you do this be honest  but be protective of yourself  There's no need to gut yourself over this

Hey do you wanna talk about it   Im here for you pls have a think of it before you do something wrong 
Hello    how old are you  you told that you are scared to talk with your mom  parents   but are there other people that could help you through your bad days  maybe you dont even need people  but just a funny movie or you eat your favourite cookies on these days to get your mood up a bit   sorry for the bad english  
This just totally     everybody's comments here have been incredibly validating and I genuinely feel comforted right now  I grew up with a mom who constantly yelled about anything and I was constantly treading on thin ice and trying to play it safe  She was the kind of person who would blow up completely at the smallest things  like forgetting to hang up my towel after a shower or getting a C on a quiz at school  I was constantly berated for being "lazy"  in addition to classes  i have 3 jobs and volunteer  and a "bitch"  I constantly make every effort to be as kind and sunshiny of a person as I can    Now I'm SUPER sensitive to anger and raised voices  the other day my roommate sent me an angry sounding text while I was at work  and instead of going home after work I was scared and stayed at a friend's house for the night  Another time  one of my sorority sisters yelled at me for something during recruitment  a super high stress time  and I ended up having a full blown  sobbing  hyperventilating panic attack in the kitchen    I thought something was wrong with me  so it's really nice knowing I'm not the only one 
they ridicule you for their own insecurities  who gives a shit where you are in life it's no ones business but yours  
Awesome video  You did great    I loathe flying but love travelling  and I have to make myself do it because of overthinking sometimes  Got to see Maine and California this year  So worth it   Really makes me want to start planning another trip right now  Which one was your favourite

Taking drugs helps
i think i spelled it wrong it doesn't matter my parents don't want me on anything stronger than that  
I emphasize with your struggles  I was going through a very stressful time in college this most recent semester  Last year I was prescribed Fluoxetine which worked fairly well for my depression except for the side effects including nightmares   headaches  tremors  jaw clenching  the occasional mania  which I kind of miss except for one serious incident where I felt way too good after finals    I was walking with my former girlfriend outside a giftshop that played Ohio State's marching band songs and tried doing a high kick like the drum major after she told me to and ended up kicking myself into the air  I landed on my arm   hyperextending and fracturing my left elbow and wrist on asphalt    yeah    that left me feeling like a grade A moron after an ambulance had to be called since I was in the worst pain of my life and couldn't stand up  She felt so guilty because she thought it was her fault since she told me to do it but I definitely wouldn't have made such a reckless high kick if I was on the mood stablizer I'm on now     etc  After about 7 months of enduring the side effects I had enough  so I switched to Zoloft which didn't work out for me  and then Wellbutrin which made my anxiety nearly impossible to manage on my own   After being prescribed three different medications by family doctors  I was told I had to see a psychiatrist  so I called the on campus psychiatric services asking for an outpatient appointment  The phone conversation went like this     Hello     Hi  I'd like to schedule an appointment     Sorrywe'refull  hangs up   I was stressed out enough before I called  After I heard the sound of a phone slamming down to hang up I involuntarily let out a torrential downpour of tears  People who are suffering from any mental illness are likely to struggle with getting help on their own  especially with depression  People  like me  who on some days have barely enough motivation to get out of bed but realize how much they're suffering and try to get help should not be treated this way  but unfortunately there's people out there who work mental health jobs who don't truly care   Don't let this stop you from seeking help from elsewhere  There are people out there who really do care and will help you

Thank you very much
hey mate   im 16 and was in that situation before    Honestly the only way to end that situation if you want to is  to straight up talk to her about your concerns and feelings just like you did to us in this subreddit  and if you think about it  there is nothing to loose by doing that  I know you need to be very brave to do this  but im sure you are strong enough   3 hope i helped in some way
If you're straight  you're straight  Nothing wrong with it and no changing it  It's harmful for the bi community for you to say you are when you aren't  so just be whomever you truly feel you are and embrace it 
i dreamed once that i was in a relationship with my crush  as i woke up and realized it was a dream i felt absolutely devasteted for the first 5 minutes or so   still hurts tho    I hope you feel better soon  
Used to happen to me but then i discovered that it was caused by eating raw apples  especially fresh ones  
You need a note from your doctor therapist about your anxiety  My school district got really strict the last year I was there and wanted documentation for absences 
I loved DC the most  I loved the city and the museums and met some cool people   I really enjoyed Vancouver Whistler to Portland leg  It was fast paced and challenging and I went with just a backpack  No car  I enjoy being outdoors more and more  I hadn't really traveled much in almost a decade and didn't realize how much I just enjoy being outside 
I do the same thing  Writing them down may help  I'm learning to appreciate things again as well
Hey  sorry I only just saw this  I think what this sub shows is that people do care  it just maybe takes living with this condition to be able to properly empathise  Any time you want to talk i'm happy to 
I absolutely relate  I refuse to allow myself to have certain thoughts  They come up and I literally just go "No  not anymore  I said I wasn't going to " and start thinking about every random thing under the sun until the thought it gone  Just don't latch on  you can't help what thoughts come into your head  but you can help which thoughts you dwell on 
Right  I want to have something to focus on  Much rather be physically tired
Thank you so much  Congratulations on your new life though  I hope you realize the power you have  Take baby steps  I went on one solo trip in 2015 and I was SOOO SCARED that it would be miserable and terrifying but it made me realize the power and control I've gained in my life over the years  
Glad for you  I hope things get even better 
You two made my whole day right there  i just wanna thank you for sharing it

I'm stuck in a really bad financial situation and my living situation is extremely toxic  I feel vulnerable  I can't afford my car anymore and there's something wrong with it anyway 
Feel confident in the decision you have made  You made it for the right reasons and that's what's important  Good luck to you in the future  here's to a 2017 with a little less anxiety 
You have a huge backpack to carry  i wish you all the best with that  Problems like yours are not easy to solve  i myself am in a similar situation and i think we should just try and find something we really want to live for  and then we can start to build our live back up  always with that one thing in our minds   sorry for the bad english back  
i don't understand your point this is not a political post you are talking about a country i am talking about a small village called "bam"  i understand when you read my text is sounds bad but i was only talking about the neighbors and it was around 18 years ago i can't fit everything in one post  i am in the right category no  
To me it feels similar to spacing out  but more physical  if that makes sense  When I "space out"  and am just not paying attention I still feel present  This feels different physically  I think what I've found that helps me over the last week or so is to be mindful of it and pull myself back  I can feel myself sort of drifting away and have to really be aware of it lately  I hope this passes for both of us  I've been getting into meditation and yoga and it helps me with mindfulness  which seems to help this weird feeling happen less and less  
Yes  they will  It's a coping mechanism  It will help you to deal with the thoughts better  I don't want you to be afraid of what I am about to tell you  but the thoughts may never go away  Don't think that you are beyond help or dealing with it  however  There are people that have completely gotten over their thoughts  and bless them for it    What mindfulness will help you do is  instead of reacting in such an intense way to the thoughts  anxiety  depression  etc    it will lessen the pain around it  It's a way that teaches you not to resist the thoughts  as much as you want to  and just learn to let them go   It's more of a meditation thing  and like I said  it's really helped me  The Mindfulness Workbook for OCD is a good resource  There are some out there that focus more on the spiritual aspect of it  zen  buddhism  etc    but I find that this workbook really gets to the heart of it for people suffering from OCD  And if you're iffy about spiritualism or religion  don't worry  this workbook doesn't cover anything related to that    Dr  Jon Hirshfeld is the one who wrote it  and he works through the OCD Center in LA and Baltimore 
Can you write down what goes through your mind  Maybe it will sort it a bit  If i have those   im loosing my mind" feelings  i turn my headphones up and listen to music super loud  that helps   try   iridescent" from linkin park  and tell me how you like it   Hope you are feeling better soon  
Awesome  I can relate to most of them  Love Sloth and Snooze    
I've been a welder  mechanic  remodeled houses  delivery driver  retail  I don't think I can go back to that   I don't like working alone but I don't do well with a lot of people either  Physically I don't think I can weld anymore   I'm only mid thirties but I'm in pretty bad shape  Thank you for your response you put a lot of thought into it 
I am so sorry  That is awful  It feels like a omen  a sign and a portent  It's not  I promise  Counselors and people who field calls are people  and as with people in any profession  some  perhaps most  of them will not operate at the level they should be operating at   It's frustrating when the mental health system often only gets one or a few shots at offering help and giving you hope  and the person you interface with doesn't have the capacity to offer anything constructive and does more harm than good   Happened to me in a different setting  when I hit rock bottom and knew I needed help  I went to see a therapist and he spent an entire session making fun of me and cracking jokes about my situation  It was gut wrenching  I still feel sick thinking about those sessions  This guy was well respected and credentialed  I was a person hanging on by a thread who desperately needed help and because of his ignorance I went another 6 months not seeing any professional whatsoever  I wouldn't have found my way back at all without support people who basically forced me to because they assumed  quite correctly  it's what I would've wanted if I were thinking clearly    I found a better therapist who's actually good at her damn job and things have gotten better  I'm not telling you this as a "go get 'em  champ" sort of thing  Sometimes the system is so prohibitively ineffective that people go years without finding someone who can actually give the help they need    The point is  the failures of the system do not reflect you or your condition  Don't believe anyone who suggests that anything less than complete support and validation from a professional means your situation is not serious  It is  You wouldn't be seeking help and posting on here if it wasn't  The likelihood that the person you've communicated with is kind of shitty at what they do is far greater than your problems being trivial and unimportant   Thank you for taking the step to share your experience here  I'm sorry everything has to be so hard right now  
Contact someone higher up  like a manager
If you can manage a couple long flights I'd suggest going to Europe   The flights right now to and from are pretty cheap   4 500 round trip from NYC  cheap from LA too   Then when you get there  trains are everywhere   You can up and go to Prague last minute for not too much and you don't have to worry about border crossings or dealing with airports 
thats just so true  
I can completely relate my health anxiety always consists of either throat or lung cancer issues  The only good thing to come out of it was it helped me to quit smoking but I still struggle daily  I'm even at the point some days of feeling even more anxious if I actually feel fine  
There are high points and pitfalls when it comes to recovery  It takes a long fucking time  I'm still not even there yet  I was told that things aren't always going to be good  and that's okay  there will be bad days  I'm glad I was told honestly because that makes the really shitty days a bit easier to get through  knowing that it will happen and to not freak out when you aren't happy 100  of the time   It's not good to say 'everything will be fine'   You are still going to feel pain  but you will also feel happy at times as well  It's not easy  but people should be told like I was  that it isn't always going to be good  You have to feel bad to feel good   it sucks  but it's how we are  depression just makes pain a hell of a lot worse 
Upvote for being honest about your situation  It's a tricky one for sure  but I don't know how to phrase my advice any other way than "if you love her  let her go"  Cut all contact from her if possible  At some point it's no longer love  and becomes a burden for both parties involved    As someone who has been on the receiving end of "obsessive love" with no intention of ever reciprocating it  it can be a dreadful and heavy burden  In my case  we started off as friends  but he became possessive and jealous over the smallest things even though he had no right to be  This obviously put a massive strain on our friendship  and I cut him out of my life because of all the anxiety I would get from being around him  It was suffocating  I miss the friendship a lot  but don't regret my decision    Hope this gives you a bit of perspective of the other side  so that maybe you can find closure for yourself too  
There are so many lonely people here  Why can't we be friends    For me it's because I fear that I lost my ability to "connect" to people  no matter how nice and well meaning they are  That I have nothing to contribute and just bore others  That they 'find out' about me   Recently there was a  "looking for friends" thread  https   www reddit com r depression comments 5ko0li anyone hear want to be friends   in this sub  But I can't really participate in that  
Please don't think your 'genes' make you not a good person  You're defined by things you do  things you think  and things you like  And please don't think people don't like you because of your appearance  Even if some people are actually like that  that's because THEY are pieces of shit  And you don't have to be good at study and sports  Those two are not the only gifts people could have  You have so much more possibilities  please don't give up yet  It's never too late 
23 year old here  I have support groups in my area  but none of the times offered work for my schedule  So I do the online DBSA young adult support groups  I recommend it  The groups are informative and it's nice to be able to talk to the same people every week  Online friends are definitely different from in person friends  but I'm assuming you're wanting someone to confide in and provide support for your condition  which is what everyone in the support group does  
Hey you may of wasted time writing that out  but maybe it kept you from focusing on negative thoughts for fifteen minutes   I have been feeling so especially crappy lately too and I'm just trying to hang in there    I'm glad you at least say that you won't harm yourself   I'm sure you have something to contribute to the world be it big or small and we need you to stick around to accomplish that   Things can get better   One baby step at a time     I agree that the world we live in these days sucks and that so many people are less fortunate than us   Lots of people are unhappy and it's not commonly talked about   Just know you're not alone and try to challenge some of your negative thoughts   Remember to ask yourself if you're jumping to negative conclusions   Trying to postulate how you would perceive your circumstances if you were a positive thinker  just as an exercise     I hope things turn up for the better   Get your heart rate up if you can  go for a walk today   
Yes  Suicidal thoughts are a feeling  They sit in a cloud that constantly shrouds over you  Even when you're happy and laughing  the thought and feeling of suicide is still there  it never completely fades  It may not feel as strong on a scale  it may be lower  but it's still there  No matter where I am or what I'm doing the thought and feeling of suicide is always present somewhere in my mind   even if I'm not trying to think about it  the cloud remains  The feeling never passes 
I can 100  guarantee your friend didn't notice  That is such a small gesture  he probably if anything was worried about offending you if he brushed your chest 
Those are very beautiful  She has great skill 
I have the opposite problem  any time I've ever handed ANYONE my dog  they've touched my tits  LOL 
The knowledge that you understand what I'm describing is a huge thing to offer me  and I thank you for that 
Hi  it doesn't seem like you know much about weed so don't give advice  Weed is out of your system in 1 month and there are no withdrawal symptoms besides boredom and insomnia   As for your question OP  I need more information before I can give you some advice  How often did you smoke weed  How much did you smoke  Were you depressed before you started smoking 
I look forward to more of these 
Do you still have feelings  Now that you are on an even keel are you realizing you truly did not want to end it but did it because you were going through an episode or struggles so you pushed them away 
haha wow i had no idea anyone else felt the same way  Its true  it does seem kinda silly when I say it out loud
The first step is to stop thinking someone else is your whole world   You are your whole world   period 
It's a hobby 
I appreciate the advice for sure  I'm not really afraid to talk to him about it  though  I think the reason I haven't yet is because until I sat down and typed it out  I didn't really know how to describe it  I kinda wrote this more to see if anyone knew  like  why it's only brought on by climax   But thank you  More than likely  I'll talk to him soon and he'll be just as clueless as I am lol 
This is pretty much what hasn't allowed me to escape the HA cycle of hell   I always seem to wake up with some kind of pain discomfort each morning  It can be my knee  I bumped it really hard back in October  or most usually throughout the day it is sternum rib neck spine pain  And very few things seem to take my mind off it  walking exercise helps sometimes and well getting drunk  but I've decided to lay of the booze cuz it isn't exactly the best coping mechanism    The thing is that getting pains troughout the day is normal for most people  I think that we are just hypersensitive to it  Talked to my mum today  she has chronic back pain  a pinched nerve which causes her not to feel one of her toes and even chest tightness and an upset stomach  this is purely psychological as she got some bad news recently   But she wakes up and goes about her day as usual and doesn't even complain about it  Aunt and cousin also have chronic back pain from sitting at a desk carrying a heavy child 
Seems overwhelming but things will be A OK  IMO buspar is a sugar pill more than anything  Prozac is far more superior than buspar  What dose were you on when you tried Prozac   The starter dose is 20mg  I remember i started at 5mg and moved up 5mg every week and it curved any side effects I was having  Maybe try that  
Can you relate to that gut feeling I'm talking about  Do you have any other ways to describe it  It's so new and bizarre to me   
Oh yeah caffeine that late will guarantee an all nighter   
It's almost universally an unpaid position  
I've come to realize like any medication  moderation is key right  But its days like today i pulled up to work to find out the shop was closed   GREAT i get the day off   but not so great cuz I'll probably just smoke my face off even though i know I'll regret it  Now I'll probably pace my home for a couple hours trying to convince myself to do the hundred other things i need to get done which leads to realizing the time  money  and energy its gonna take which leads to feeling hopeless and depressed and plotting a clean easy fail safe suicide   I don't suggest smoking when unemployed especially just to pass already idle time  I've always made it a point not to when in your situation   I think we all know in the back of our mind when we're abusing a substance dont let the self destructive thoughts overcome   also ANY work is better than none even if has nothing to do with your career   i had a lot of fun stocking shelves nights   Anyway i hope something in there helps  Also there was a list of movies on front page about "loners" for better of a word   I ended up watching one called NAKED  1993  its on KODI if you have it   strange yes but has really interesting dialog 
I started on 20mg Prozac too  maybe I should ask my psychiatrist to try it again  I just feel bad that I was such a pussy and barely gave it a chance   Edit  Prozac  not buspar
I didn't make it to the class  But I did some self care at home and sat in front of some roses my partner bought me and just meditated on their beauty  
I can't offer much help for people with depression as someone who suffers from it everyday  I just think its important to reach out to other people and see you are not alone in how you feel  Depression makes you feel isolated and insecure and so I look at various support sites for people with depression as a way to cope and connect with people like myself

I was worried about the same thing two weeks ago  so much so that I felt an ER visit was worth it  I've had Bradycardia my whole life  so I thought that was the end  Turns out I have Sinus Node Arrhythmia  You're breathing speeds up and slows down when you inhale and exhale  It's very common  like I can't even explain in words how common this is  If your really concerned talk to your GP  Odds are you're gonna be fine  Most people have some form of irregularity  and most people never notice  Hope this helps  
To be honest  the stomach pain might have been from anxiety  I had the same kind of pain this morning

At the hardest point in my life  I called the suicide hotline and the person on the other side just seemed so disinterested in helping  not to mention the half hour of waiting for someone to be available    I'm sorry you had such an awful experience  I think there are better ways of getting more meaningful help  Try 7 Cups Of Tea

Yes and it could be pure adrenaline without you realizing it 
That made me tear up  you're right  who doesn't feel exposed and vulnerable at climax  Thank you for your input  I really appreciate it   I have been to quite a few therapists in my life and have yet to find one that really gets what it's like in my brain on a daily basis  Do you know if there are  like  therapists that specialize in this kind of trauma  Admittedly  I've been putting my therapist off because she just doesn't click with me   
I definitely will tell him after the vacation  I'm also meeting with a professional once every two weeks   I hope you'll get help as well  I know sometimes things feel bad af  but in the end everything's gonna be okay in one way or another     Let's stay strong

If you suffer from anxiety panic mystery chest pain is most likely due to hyperventilation  Chest pain and anxiety go hand in hand with each other  If it is anxiety panic related  it's more of a scary feeling than it being actually dangerous  If you feel a need to visit an ER then you should never second guess it but  if you're prone to anxiety panic   I'm willing to bet that's the cause of it 
I hope you're gonna have the strength to stay next to your bf  All the best for you two 
A nice short term solution and a terrible one longterm  I got really drunk on New Year's and then felt even worse the next day   I was asking myself the same question as the OP or a similar one  My current problem is more of a having trouble stopping focusing on physical aches and pains and discomfort  I am seeing a therapist in a few weeks  but would like to be better by then  I have already lost 3 months of my life to this and I want to stop feeling miserable   I don't have the answers  but I am going to try with the following   1  No googling researching symptom checking 2  Moving more   I try to get at least an hour of walking each day and want to get back into swimming and start with Pilates which might in turn improve my issues with back pain that played a huge part in setting oc my HA  though who knows what came first by this point  3  Spend more times with tasks that require full attention   lrarning languages  reading as well as performing household chores 4  Spending more time with people   friends and family  even if it is hard not to concentrate on this hellish HA when with then right now  it's bound to get better 5  The last but probably the most important one  I will try to accept that I will not get better overnight and won't just suddenly wake up feeling better next morning as if the last 3 months didn't happen  It requires work  Sucks that I have no patience in this regard 
Heating pads are designed to handle heat  slim to zero chance it'll actually melt   unless you don't follow directions on how to use it  I use heat pads all the time for my neck when I'm under heavy loads of anxiety  If anything it works wonders 
It hard to save someone online  People with depression need real support as well as the motivation to get better to make changes in their lives  I see depression as a response to how one is feeling in their environment as for me I get really depressed when my social anxiety kicks in and I am not able to do things the way I want to  Making changes is hard and frustrating and oftentimes requires to leave someone or something behind 
Holy Moly  As soon as i looked at these  I got goosebumps all over my body   Everything is so accurate down to the last detail  Thank you to you and your sister for sharing this with us  Lots of love xo
Just started with Effexor XR last week  and hit the target dosage  225mg  today    I'm currently in the adjustment phase  so I'm experiencing pretty much all the listed side effects   fatigue  dizziness  spacing out  no appetite whatsoever  near complete sexual dysfunction  hot cold waves  nausea  sweating  dry mouth   it's so hard to concentrate at work  and I feel like a zombie once I'm off  Can't wait for it to end   
I'm sorry to hear that  Message me if you want to talk 
Maybe it's time for professional help like cbt therapy  Good chance it can help  get you out of that funk  
I'm sorry  Message me if you want to talk 
 Bear Hug  Hug you harder then you could imagine  And i rub your back with both of my hands  I whisper into your ear one day at a time  Lots of love from me to you xxoo
I hope it works out for you  it really helped me a lot 
Negative thought patterns are my biggest concern  I think about my illness 24 7  And I believe my mind is atrophied because of this unproductive thinking  My job is pizza delivery which unfortunately lets my mind wander and ruminate on stressors  I think the mind is like a muscle and we have to exercise its capabilities such as memory and problem solving  Its not enough to distract it with music or chores or tv  you need to push your brain into higher levels of thinking  Read a book  solve math problems  draw  play a video game  play sudoku  fix things  socialize     just do something that requires interaction and imagination  I think these activities promote healthy idle thought patterns  
Talk to your doc about your medication either upping the dose or changing it  Dizziness can also be caused by hyperventilating 
I know it's rough   It has to be really rough for you to go through that   My parents and brother are the only reason why I haven't killed myself yet   I don't want to hurt them   But for god sakes it's fucking hard for me at times   Living is too fucking painful at times   I know that killing myself will make it worse for my family   That's the only reason why I haven't done it 
Loved the video and song  
Sad to see you go   
I would think if there was an abscess you would have gotten antibiotics when they did your x ray  I'm sure you'll be fine but you could always call your dentist or oral surgeon and ask their opinion  
What the hell  They need to hire better people  They should only have empathetic people who genuinely want to help people working on suicide hotlines  People who call them are already feeling pretty fragile  They do NOT need someone who is just going to yell at them for being depressed or act indifferent and disinterested  I'm sorry you had to deal with that  Her rude responses were unhelpful but that does not say anything negative about you  You called the hotline for help and they did not deliver  That does not make you a piece of shit or anything  that means they don't know how to do their job  If you ask me  they're the human trash cans in this scenario   I know that people who work suicide hotlines are generally volunteers but the people in charge should take into serious consideration who they allow to take calls  Suicidal people are not something to handle carelessly 
I just deleted mines about a week ago it feels sloop good  However I did make a fake account just so I could stay in contact with messenger for a few of my real friends  That way no one will ever find me 
It so nice to see people have the same OCD rules as me    Thanks for sharing 
Sounds like they dont get paid well and are overworked but its still no reason to treat you like that

Thanks for the advice   Its good to know that it is possible  and what some timelines are     Manitoba here   We'll try engaging with the Moods Disorder Society of Manitoba again  but the last time we tried  they ignored us  didn't answer phones  never called back 
Right   I'm surprised he is not banned but I bet it's because he used alt accounts

That is my biggest fear that when I do break down and reach out for help that no one will care  Don't put yourself down because people don't know how to help you  I think most of the ppl at the hotlines are volunteers anyways  Just keep looking for help and perhaps go to the emergency room instead  
  I calmed down enough to try and callback to report it  I was relived to read that  then     but the person I spoke to that time was even less concerned   If you're up for it  call them again  This is absolutely wrong  And maybe sheds some insight  Nothing is wrong with  you   but there are some circumstances which just make a wrong out of anything 
Thank you  I'm happy to not be alone in this situation  You did make me feel better  and you got me on better mood  I wish you a great New Year and I hope that someday we will live a great life 
I've been the same way  I'm either an all or nothing person  It's hard for me to comprehend someone not enjoying my company completely  I'm 32 and married and I still feel this way  But on the flip I also need my head space and need people to back off  It's selfish   But that's the issue  It's not so much them but us  We need to realize how we have relationships is not very healthy  If your doing the all or nothing thing  it's not a good thing  So it's less about getting over people and more about being comfortable with where things go in yourself 
It's not just the gym    Everyone  everywhere is too busy being self conscious to pay a fraction as much attention to you than you think they are   My whole quality of life went up 30  once I realized that  
I actually got married at 21     You can call it a lot of things but I definitely don't consider it an accomplishment  Bad marriage  Stupid marriage  Young marriage  Aaah  
I am sorry for your loss  It must be difficult but remember just because you are diagnosed bipolar does not mean that is why you are struggling  Depression sadness is normal when grieving from the loss of a family member  The blankness you feel could be the sadness you feel from losing someone   The best thing you can do is rely on your support system around you like your mom  Talk talk and talk more  The more you get it out the more you will see you do have people around you who care    Also feel free to continue to post up here as much as you want  There are some great people in these groups who love to listen and provide support and share their own stories and how they have gotten through them
   Thanks for putting a bit of light into this glum world   3
For what it's worth  I'm 27 and I'm still afraid of growing up  Everyone you meet is just a kid trying to figure out what the hell happened    I understand though  College allows you to maintain some of the patterns you follow in highschool  you follow a routine that is largely set by others  You have mentors and teachers  You have peers you see everyday  Then one day it abruptly ends and you immediately lose that structure and support  I think some people wind up in grad school purely because they don't know what else to do   A word of advice  drop the guilt about living with your parents for the time being  It's rooted in old fashioned and antiquated ideas that aren't going to be of much use to you  I have a reasonably high paying job now and live on my own  I never would have been able to accomplish what I have without my parents acting as a springboard from time to time   I have a close friend who has lived in a trailer on his parent's property for the last six years or so  Sounds like a real loser right   That's SIX YEARS of rent he's avoided paying with the blessing of his family  He and his girlfriend are going to buy  a house of their own within the next year  He got there by being pragmatic and not caring about what strangers might think of his living situation   As long as you have a goal you shouldn't let it bother you    Have you given any thought about your next goal 
Psychosis is a legitimate fear  It happened with my first baby  and worse  I never got it diagnosed  I told everyone I was just a little depressed  So they put me on antidepressants  which just made everything worse  I did eventually get things fixed  but I'll be honest  it took a couple of years to get back to normal    My advice is that you have a comprehensive psych plan before birth  with support people who know when you aren't functional  Also  and this is entirely anecdotal  placenta encapsulation was amazing for me the second time  and I plan to do it again with this baby  
You are lying   In another thread where you've posted this survey you say you need it for school  Your posts are full of grammatical errors and the survey is amateur   You say you don't want to offend anyone   You can start by being honest     
My 24th birthday is in 3 days and I'm pretty sure no one will show up  NYE was awful  Christmas even worse  Had my purse stolen in broad daylight the day after Christmas  Going on my third year of singlehood  Unfulfilling job  Lost 30 pounds in the first half of this year and I'm slowly gaining it back  Anything else 
Yeah man  Keep going  Have you ever thought about going to the gym 
I haven't really panicked lately  but I'm beginning to wonder if it's acid indigestion  Recently I've had very strong heartburn symptoms  burning sensation in chest and throat  and now I find myself burping a lot throughout the day as well as those tiny pinching pains in certain spots in my chest  I have no clue if this is the exact cause  but my anxiety isn't really helping it as I'm finding myself feeling more panicked the more it continues to happen   Granted  this is only day two  so this may be the beginning as things settle  I've been eating clean as of late 
Urghh fuck that then  I deleted Facebook and Twitter a couple of years back and it's one of the few things I look back on with positivity  
Very cool artwork and relatable as well   
You can do it  Contrary to our anxious driven beliefs  hospitals are actually the best places for potential panic attacks because they have means to help calm you down professionally and caringly  Plus you can have all the TV you want  It won't be as bad as you think  Just go   you'll feel so much better if you do and you'll have peace of mind   better to be "safe than sorry"  Hope you recover quickly         Hugs OP     No pressure to of course  but please keep us posted if you can  
You need to stop focusing on what ills you believe that your mother did does to you and focus on what you are doing to better yourself   You have to own your disease and own up in being responsible to combat it   It is unrealistic to think that your mother should let you live in her home without trying to push you into becoming an healthy adult   Some parents wouldn't even try to get their kids into some kind of mental health help   It may not have worked the way you wanted but at least her intentions were to try and help you    Instead of bashing your mom  grow up and take some positive control over in your life  Use your energy wisely  It's time to grow up   
I get carried away with fantasy's too  You should look up maladaptive daydreaming  I like it though  It's a nice escape  
Awesome  very good to hear    I know the key is to start small here  But I would suggest going on walks   doing body weight exercises at home  and stretching    Just doing these little things on a daily basis literally take the pain away from lying in bed most days  or sitting at a desk at work  Plus when I am exercising I use it as the part of my day to "think" all of those thoughts that I dont want to think about when I am lying in bed exhausted   All the best lots of love xo
Try to do 4 tomorrow  GJ
But I'm so scared   It seems everyone I talk to  professional or otherwise  tries to put me down   I know that in order to get better I need to be able to open up but each time I try I regret it so much   I feel really stuck   I truly want to get better   The thought of continuing to make myself vulnerable just sounds like torture   
In your case smoking weed is just procrastinating your pain then your problems come back you need to face the hard reality
You should throw up and call for help  People can be shit  but they can also be wonderful and you can't live without those fuckers 
I shrug and say "I don't know"  they usually chuckle  I don't want to say fine  because I don't feel fine  but I know it's more of a courtesy comment then a real question  Nobody really cares what you feel like if they aren't close to you  
Yep  I'm awkward too  guy though   it's all bullshit  In my experience awkwardness just makes you look weird to everyone else  I often lay in bed at night and think about all the shit social experiences I've got myself into  Even when they aren't that bad I still over think them  
Sorry I meant 20mg of Prozac is the starter dose  You can try a lower dose and move up if needed  Could be I have stomach pains and issues all the time as well  Have a talk with your p doc and see what they recommend  I'm not a fan of buspar as it did nothing but give me dizzy spells for an hour or 2 after taking it  
The first one  it looks like an elastic band nearly  like the heart is going to be ripped into the past leaving no heart for the future  Also  the last hand not clasping on the support one  well       
Sad to see another person go   
Yeah  I meant Prozac too  haha  I'm on 10mg buspar
I might check out some podcasts and i didn't know there was a no sleep one  I used to love that sub a couple of years back  It went abit down hill from what I remember but I'll certainty check it out  
I messaged my psychiatrist  and I see him next week
I did two too out of inspiration or spite  who knows  So thanks  I guess 
Oh yeah stomach issues heartburn  GERD etc can def cause "chest pain" when in fact is not chest but stomach pain  If the pain is around the heart area towards the bottom of the rib cage  Try some ginger root tea or anti acid like tums and see if that works  I sometimes drink carbonated mineral water with salt and lime  helps settle my stomach down almost instantly  Stomach issues and anxiety go hand in hand as well  the stomach is like a second brain in a way  
Couldn't agree more   I love Rick   Morty  futurama and American dad  I can just switch off and enjoy them    There's a few series I like tbf  The inbetweeners  the office  it crowd  But fuck films  
I personally don't think it's worth opening up the wound for you or him  If you did hurt him  he probably has gotten over it by now  Your apology might not mean anything to him and it may be painful for you to have to admit the wrong you've done to him  but if it makes you feel better and settles your mind  then go for it  I definitely understand the desire to clear the air  
Exchanges like "How are you " "I'm fine  thanks  And you " are just polite talk  which just means it's a social norm established to set another  test  if you will  of your inclusion in the community  You have to know to say the question  and you have to know how to answer  and the exchange tells both of you that you are both part of the same social community via completing these "formalities"   Since it doesn't really mean anything  we spend most of our lives spitting and repeating just as a greeting  not as a real inquiry    But then when someone asks "How are you " and you are NOT fine  the inquiry just draws attention to that fact  Suddenly you are re aware of whatever it is that is making you not fine  and aware that  socially  it's not acceptable to be not fine    I think that's why if feels so bad to tell even that little lie  "How are you " is a matter of inclusion  and when you're not doing so well  you realize how alienated you are

Good to hear  10mg of buspar hasn't done anything for you  I actually took 30mg at one point and still didn't do anything lol
I used to do alot of pot back in my teens  Also done alot of coke too but as I got on abit I thought it was best to leave them behind    Not sure I could smoke weed again  sometimes gets me abit twitchy  I miss stimulants though  The smell  the dripback the fucking rush  Shittt  now I'm craving a gram    
You put a smile on my face after I had tears running down it tonight  Thank you for choosing to keep living  I agree with you there is a lot more experiences to be felt during your lifetime  and there are plenty of other drugs to try    Valium Xanax is great   really takes the edge of all the dark thoughts  It makes my problems go away  not sure if thats a bad thing or a good thing but it helps me to keep on living and I am okay with that   Sending you love  I salute you for your courage   It musnt have been easy to end your life  but it would have been harder choosing not to end it and thats why your a hero  xoxo
To clarify  of course  there's nothing wrong with using them 
You're welcome  Unfortunately I have no experience with Agmatine but from the literature I've read  it appears to exert its antidepressant effect through NMDA signaling inhibition  So maybe a different mechanism from sarcosine but it leads to the same downsteam effects 
i agree with Onedayy and as someone who's been in a similar situation  I'd add  be careful not to push her too hard  but if it shouldn't go in the direction you'd like it to go  never blame yourself  I was miserable from 15 to 18  because I was in love with this angel of a girl and she broke up with me and dated my best friend  I'm way older now and let me tell you  that even though it seems unbelievable at this point in your life  she is not the only person who could love you and who you'd be capable of seeing the way you see her now  I just want to tell you that despite things might seem dark and hopeless sometimes in relationships  they're not  still  keeping my fingers crossed for you  either way  life will bring you good things 
I'm going through something similar and it's why I'm basically on this subreddit   I only have a small handful of people that I feel are genuine to hang out with   real friends are hard to come by   a lot of people have burnt bridges with me  no longer entertain me  A friend who actually hangs out and who you can have fun with is important  or add anything to my life  I've had to burn bridges with them because they don't have the best intentions for me or their lack of availability and blunt replies just make me feel they don't care   I worry that if I confide in somebody too much about my setbacks and downfalls I will push them away due to people cutting ties with me before  I also have a relationship but my boyfriend lives quite far away from me and we only get to meet every other week   when we do I have a lot of fun and I'm at my happiest not to mention when I do eventually see some other friends   but other than that I'm bored of being in all the time and reaching out to people who are no longer the sort to want to do the exciting things I would plan or who have awkward availability   it's pretty lonely   a lot of things at home irritate me too  it just all feels monotonous and like I'm stuck in the same position and I'm left alone  thinking more about the friendships that didn't work out  people who didn't share my values or who treated me badly  I like that regular company and I want to fill this new year with fun activities but most times I have no option but to stay in and be alone   try to work on myself and find happiness in that even though it can get old and it's not easy due to not being fully satisfied in my environment and to be fair most connections I have just aren't giving me the happiness  fulfillment and companionship I would like and I'm not really sure how to go about making a lot of new ones with similar interests 
Man as someone who went out of his way to find the correct pills combo  you're probably not going to die  But good luck 
Oh yeah I see  you were saying our measure of time is a social construct  tru tru
I constantly have eye strain since I work in a dark room in a factory inspecting small pieces of plastic all day for small scratches etc  I also have astigmatism in one eye and mildly bad vision  my eyes give me headaches frequently and also have made me tired in the past 
It's better to make a reasoned decision to improve things than to wait until it all crashes down around your ears and then have to pick up the pieces  Onwards and forwards  and good luck 
7Cups doesn't take calls regarding suicidal ideation intent  Did this once and they instantly apologized but told me to go seek professional help call the suicide hotline instead  I'm guessing it's cause they're not trained to take such calls 
I think it did a little at first  but I must have built a tolerance to it  It's 10mg 3 times a day  so I guess technically 30mg
Thank you for your advice  I myself have 2 cats that I will sit with when I need it  But personally i feel like talking to an actual person is better  Hope you find a way to deal with your struggles too  
Right  I often wonder why my anxiety makes me so narcissistic  I have a song that I always go back to thats main chorus says 'maybe you're nothing at all'  It calms me down when I feel like the whole world is against me because it reminds me that I pay more attention and feel worse about myself and my actions than anyone else does    
Sertralin  My memory got worse  I can't sleep a full night and I concentrate worse on work  It works though  maybe even too well  because I've become kinda indifferent even to things that I believe should piss me off or make me sad  Oh well  Hopefully I'll be off rather soon

You can quit being bipolar anytime you want  It's not real  
I went to the eye doctor a few weeks ago because my eyes had been aching  especially in dim places  and driving at night   He told me that he saw some irritation and that the pores in my eyelids were blocked and gave me some stuff to try to clean the stuff out  So far  it hasn't worked  I am thinking that the root of my problems could be eye strain and I don't know if that is true or if I should trust what the doctor said  Never in my life have a been so tired  My eyes are always so heavy and I have been having constant nagging headaches and nausea on occasion  I went to the movies last night and I could hardly keep my eyes open because they ached so bad  Any help   My father also passed away when I was younger from brain cancer so I am kind of freaking out that this could have something to do with that  even though people have told me I would be having seizures  which I haven't

Love is one of the best experiences you can feel  and heart break is the worst experience you can feel  I  know that feeling you get inside your stomach and you just feel sick  you dont want to eat  your mind is continuously clouded with thoughts and scenarios and what if this  what if that    Im gonna be blunt and sorry if this comes out wrong  but stressing out and worrying will not change the outcome  Change is an inevitable part of life and sometimes it happens for better and for worst  It sounds like your other half is saying reacting to you in a negative tone which is what would spark the feelings you are expressing  and i am sorry to hear that       At the end of the day communication is key with your other half  give her some space   maybe everything is a bit overwhelming for her over there  she's still trying to find her groove  in the mean time focus on yourself   take each day at a time and pat yourself on the back for doing so   From my experience things like this just eat me up and i can't withstand them for to long  If i can start to feel what i have been fearing I will just be straight up with the person and really ask how they are feeling towards me  you might hear some things you might not like but it's the harsh reality of life  The quicker you hear these things  the quicker you can start rebuilding yourself and putting the pieces back together  It wont be easy Im sorry to say  but this is just another test in life  Think of all the hurdles that have been presented to you thus far in life  you got through them didn't you  I wish you the best and please stay strong  life really does go on for better or for worst just focus on one thing at a time  Sending you lots of love and hugs xoxo
It depends on the hotline  not the state  All you have to do to comply with that law is say "this line is may be recorded for training and quality assurance purposes " Most companies say that anyway  regardless if the state is one or two party consent  
I'm not one to judge  I have free services through my university  I told myself for the longest time I never used them because it would take too much time  an excuse  until my legs trembled the day I decided to head over  I walked somewhere else instead  That I physically couldn't  isn't  an excuse  It's apart of the problem  but not an excuse  It's simply where I'm at   So  I don't use all my resources because I'm afraid  and with reinforcing experiences like this  I don't know how much more scared I would be  I still go to a university club  So  what do you do to try to feel better  Since it sounds like you've tried and dismissed a lot of things  you've probably learned the hard way that building on what you have is pretty much the only way to go    It is impossibly hard when for illnesses like this there's people you're allowed to open up to  and people who can't handle it  It's hard because  literally everybody  tells you to open up  but for different reasons  For some people  it's because they don't want you talking to them anymore  and think opening up to somebody else solves from problem  For some people  like those at the hotline  and they have to sign off on not having depression before working there  they want you to open up to help with the depression  In most cases  this works  In some it doesn't  There's also people who want you to open up because they know that not being allowed to  being to afraid of being vulnerable  is part of the problem  Those are the people who want to help you  depression or not  and don't expect everything to be solved at a snap  I'm pretty sure that that's everybody on this corner of the internet  But  we  all of us here  are people living somewhere  I'm sure that if you continue to be vulnerable  and that's really what opening up  opening up a vulnerability  you'll find a flesh and blood person that wants to help  you    
That's it exactly    The tricky thing is I still want to daydream  I just need to redirect my thoughts to more upbeat fantasies  I'm thinking that if I disrupt the worry train each time it starts moving  I can retrain my brain to wander more positively  Maybe doing something like reciting the multiplication tables whenever I notice my thoughts going bad  I try to keep learning and keep busy  but I need time to chill  too  
i am so sorry you don't deserve  this nobody deserves this     
I know that feeling very well  although in a completely different context  I was bullied by two of my so called 'friends'  And then  the next time I opened up again two years later I got bullied again  You feel stuck  Alone  Worthless  and don't think that you are 'worth it' you know  At a certain point the stress levels got so high that I was having coma fantasies  and was wondering if with the 'correct' dose of toxin I could put myself into one    Now  I fortunately have made some very good friends  and I can even feel positive about myself once in a while  although it still requires some effort   Getting kicked down by professionals  other volunteers at the suicide hotline sucks  The first time I got bullied the school and  my parents set me up with counseling  but I didn't dare open up and didn't accept my suffering yet  As a result and I suspect that the inexperience of the counselor didn't help either  my counselor didn't take me very seriously   Now I've had one session of CBT  and nearly had a combination of a panic attack  emotional meltdown and mental breakdown  And CBT is pretty light as far as therapy goes    but I am improving  I have found a better support group  some good friends  and a psychologist who is really helping me   Sometimes you'll have shit luck at professionals  That sucks  and shouldn't happen  Unfortunately  we don't live in a perfect universe  The fact this subreddit even exists is the proof of that   But there are professionals out there that are worth looking for  Hotlines where there have been few horror stories from  And people whom you can trust 
Naw I took a full 30mg in the morning ha and still nothing  Do you wanna try something else  
Hey there brother sister   Do not be hesitant to tell your parents  they have been with you since day 1  they have seen everything you have done in life and they will want to give you all the help and love that you need    Those are 2 things that effect those who are severely depressed   affection   and communication  If both of my parents were still alive I wish i could tell them everything from my fears to my accomplishments but i can't and thats why I am so fucked up   Plus my brother committed suicide in novemeber   youre so lucky that you still have your parents  they are there for you no mater what  you will be suprised what they might have to say towards you  Feeling depressed is no joke  once it grips you in its teeth and rips you apart and beats you down where you start to feel so small and insignificant you would have wished you took any chance to tell anyone close to you how you truely felt instead of bottling it all up because thats how i have lived my whole life and i fucken regret not saying shit when i should have    sending you lots of hugs and love xoxo
If you don't feel pressure like someone is sitting on your chest and if you don't have trouble breathing it's probably just anxiety or acid reflux  Still  going to the hospital could be good for you  at least for me when I'm anxious about something I'm less anxious about other things and could do things I'm usually afraid of 
I think it would be worth getting in contact with a superior  somehow  I'm not sure how hotlines work but I'm sure they probably have a website or something  I'm pretty sure the person you initially spoke to could face some repercussions  a suicide hotline shouldn't put those kinds of people in that kind of situation which carries so much responsibility  If you were more vulnerable you could have ended up so much worse now due to her negligence    If she was having a bad day she could have explained that she doesn't feel fit to do her job  given the nature of her job  I'm sure they would understand  As for the other person who you spoke to  if they're her superior they're doing an even worse job by letting this carry on  and I'm sure they have a superior to answer to  I'm not sure who owns or runs hotlines  but they most likely have duties and they are not fulfilling them    Once you're feeling a bit better I'd really encourage looking into this  filing an official report or something  if the phone calls are recorded then this works in your favour    I would just hate the idea of this happening and someone taking it so much more worse than you    I'm sorry this happened to you  that's the last thing that should happen in those services  please please don't think it's your fault  its theirs 
Find any comfortable spot  I use my bed and put a pillow on the wall to rest my back on  sit up in Indian style or whatever you're most comfortable sitting    Make sure the room is dark and the noise level is low   Close your eyes and relax your body  try not to think about anything   It's ok if you do  let the thought drift by  It's easy to meditate and you don't need to buy anything  you can also use music  without lyrics  good luck with your goals

Aaand  this is why I will never call a hotline  I hear way to many horror stories on here where the hotline is disinterested and hangs up  It's bullshit that we pass out these numbers like candy without taking the time to see if they're actually helpful  
So  you're dad was the one who fought with her  You told your brother  It seems like the majority of your family could have helped her  not just you  And  you thought that if you could get through it  she could  That sounds less like being selfish and more like rationalizing the situation enough that you could deal with it  Maybe it was the only way you could deal with it 
Thank you for this  You are an amazing person  This means a lot to people suffering from anxiety 
Yeah I can sort of relate  I can kind of have a conversation but like you I have nobody  never been able to make friends and when the opportunity of something arose then I'd find a way to avoid it  I don't have the answer because I don't know what to do either but I'm just here  existing sort of  I'm 25 and its weird  in high school I watched people go out  get drunk and talk about it the next day  those same people have advanced through university and are now settling down but I feel the same as I did back then just completely hollow with less to show for it now than I did back then  
This is why the only person I do this to  is somebody who knows me well enough to know why I do this  I'd never just randomly do that to somebody  though  That's       why  
Thanks for your kind words man  appreciate it  I wish you a great your too  thanke man  
That sounds like an amazing center  but your basing off all centers from your experience  There are a lot of centers that are run like a low end job  And there are a lot of "volunteers" that are only there to get something for themselves  whether that be a nice addition to a resume or to help lessen some punishment  And yes  there is training  but it can only help so far  It's really the person that has to be right for the job  and they aren't too many times  
It is completely normal to imagine that there is someone there or to even hallucinate because during sleep paralysis your brain and body are not on the same page  which is why you suddenly feel panicked  Your brain actually releases chemicals to paralyze you while you sleep and when you wake up before that wears off is where that kind of night terror comes from  Although they are connected  PTSD and sleep paralysis   they can be worked through separately  I still struggle with nightmares from time to time  I have friends who also have PTSD and they do as well  but believe me when I say that it does go away slowly and YOU ARE NOT ALONE  Kay   Here are a few things that help me   1  Sensory pillows are a fucking lifesaver  Please please please buy one  The soft light when you need it right after a nightmare is so helpful  calming  and makes it just a little easier to go back to sleep   2  This is something I had to work on and it may sound weird  but videogames  They help significantly because it in a way is a sense of false reality  but you can alter it the gameplay itself  easier than you can in real life  obviously   This has been proven to give you more control during the actual nightmare itself by either being able to wake yourself easier or even completely change the dream at your will   3  Christmas lights  Me and all of my friends who also struggle have Christmas lights in our room  Sitting in a lower light environment before the actual darkness of sleep helps you to relax better before you drift off to sleep as well as set a calm and safe mood for if sleep didn't come so peacefully    Sorry I know I just wrote you a whole fucking book  but I hope it was at least helpful in some way  I am 25 now and have had PTSD since I was a child  It's fucking hard  I know  I really do  But don't give up  please  The world needs strong people and if you are able to get through whatever traumatized you in the first place  that must mean you're already strong  Reach out when you need it and remember that life goes both ways  I hope you have a happy life    Nathaniel
Thank you for sharing   I'm in a similar dilemma  as revealing my true persona to other people led to mixed results  I've had friends distance themselves from me when I confessed my depression  For those I haven't told  I remain the 1 dimensional persons that goes gloomy and disappears every now and then   People who truly cared for me before opening up continued to care for me  However  if they are empathetic enough  their new perspective on my motivations and the way I experience things helped them give me more relevant advice  On the flip side  opening up to "normal" people and listening to their response also gave me more points to consider  and sometimes showed me a path where I thought only dead ends exist   It sounds like your husband is truly committed to being there for you  I can assure you it would have been more frustrating for him to see you like that without understanding why  The person he loves and married is still there  even if hidden behind a terrible veil  I sincerely hope you can work it out   Finally  dealing with these crises with other people is not pointless   it can enrich their lives  emotionally  It will give them perspective and a deep basis when they have to deal with similar things on their own  and no "normal" person goes through life without that   They would also have someone to lean on when the time comes    "Bear and endure  This sorrow will one day prove to be for your good "  
Do you feel there are not enough jobs to choose from or that there are too many  Do you want anything other than pay from your job  Have you thought about volunteer work  I find asking the right questions and throwing out your first thoughts help to form a flexible and achievable goal  It can be exhausting  constantly trying to find the right answers but when you feel like you and your time is worthless it's not like you're wasting it    if you want any more advice or if you just want to talk please feel free to PM me though I'm bad at replying right away I promise I'll respond as soon as I see it  Have a wonderful day if you can  and remember that although the moon doesn't produce it's own light  it is still beautiful and important 
This is so crazy  I've only had face to face therapy for GAD and social anxiety and my therapist was such a lovely lady who was very sweet     I once accidentally walked into her room early and she was eating lunch and she told me she would just be a few minutes   then she spent the first 10 minutes of my session asking how I felt about that situation and telling me that it's okay to feel awkward or embarrassed  you just have to try to not take it to heart and beat myself up about it   It was so sweet because she clearly knew how that situation would make me feel even though neither of us did anything wrong and she handled it very well      I'm sorry you had such a shitty therapist  I wouldn't even know what to do if I had to sit through that  How did they even think that was morally okay

Or post here the number  an hotline like that shouldn't hang up on people       OP  if you want to have a chat send me a PM  I promise I won't hang up   
Exactly  It's very hard to overcome ignoring it  I can even twitch    Wondering what type of OCD this falls under 
I'll see what my psychiatrist recommends  He's off today
Thank you and I hope anxiety becomes a past for you soon 
  I think that if the only motivation you have is to settle the situation in your mind  you should do it   I think OP needs to just radically accept what has happened and move on  OP do you still want a relationship with this person  Otherwise I see no purpose to this   If OP MUST contact their ex it should be through the smallest of gestures  like an email   You need to accept what happened  how you behaved  what you did  He might not forgive you  but you can forgive accept yourself   
Hey  I'd approve the medical leave  But not as  form of self isolation  like it seems might happen here  Maybe talk to the counselor and see if you can't be given class material in your time off  Like long distance course auditing   
Take care of yourself first and foremost   They can wait 
 This is how I feel every someone asks me that question  https   www reddit com r depression comments 5ggohn    
No matter how shitty your wage is  if you work in such an environment  hotline for depressed people  you shouldn't morally hang up on people    If you do that  well  you don't deserve a job in a place like that
I agree with everything you said  That teacher made the right move  The last thing anyone wants is a classroom full of kids getting a virus    I guess those who don't have this fear are more relaxed about it  Maybe thinking "oh well I'll get a day off school"  Personally I'd rather sit through hours of dental work than throw up  I would have jumped up and ran out of that room so fast  giving zero fucks  Unless  of course  there was vomit blocking the door  
Thank you 
Thank you so much  That's solid advice and really helps me  I've been meaning to find a therapist and talk to them  I think that'd do wonders for me  Thank you for caring 
I hope deression is soon just a part of your past  3
Thank you  I'll show her the comments is a bit  3
I used to be the same during PE  but then I didn't choose it as a subject anymore  school system is different in Australia   It is a compulsory class  If so  could you maybe talk to a school counsellor about how you feel  Anxiety alone sucks  but the fact that you're willing to cause serious injury to yourself  just so you can skip a class is pretty drastic  Like I can tell how much it bothers you because of the lengths you're willing to go to  Maybe you can get a doctor's note to say that you can sit out when you get too anxious  Just a suggestion  it might not work in your school system  but I thought I'd throw it out there anyway 
And thank YOU for feeling her art  Hopefully depression is soon in your past 
Great video  I viewed your other videos as well and it is obvious that you have progressed much throughout your journey    It would be nice if you could make a video talking about how you were able to improve throughout the year   The views were beautiful but I can't even get on that freeway  Haha   Happy 2017 
Thank you so much  It's great to know I have people out there who understand 
Hi there     I can relate to this too   First of all i fucken love watching twitch streams in bed I watch league of legends what about you       have been doing this for the past 5 years now at first it started off positive no negative vibes  but now its what i do to deal with the pain of being awake or dealing with the anxiety of not being able to leave my house and walk out the front door or untill i can doze off at some ridiculous hour    It sounds like to me that you are experiencing depression  this can be caused by a number of things but you will have a better idea of what then me  I will start by saying that there are a number of small things that you can do to further help yourself one step at a time   First of all you need to stop eating shit food  i know its easy and tasty but cut it out it's not gonna help you on your road to recovery  thats fine if you can only eat a small amount but PLEASE make it real food like fruit or vegetables  nothing too carby   Second of all is to do some sort of exercise  I know your situation and its fucken hard believe me Ive been experiencing this for years now and no one is gonna help you   if you cant help yourself  All you have to do is go for a 10 15 minute walk  let your thoughts run through your mind  you need to strengthen your muscles retrain them to where they once were at  even if you come back and you feel tired thats fine  take a nap you will feel better mentally for going out   trust me  I even found hill running to cure alot of my depression   i would sit at work googling running techniques  "how running cured my depression" and it's amazing  but ill stop ranting about that    third thing is to start doing some strecthing  just youtube yoga lower body back pain  something like that you will find you are getting pain in your legs because the muscles are becoming weak and they are picking up extra slack  an imbalance in the body in other words  a foam roller has saved me for many years of just lying in bed for most days  and doing yoga   24 year old male    Now whatever you are thinking about your life  it is not bad at all  this is the part of the process were you can prevent alot of negative things happening as long as you are pro active in noticing these changes and dealing with them one step at a time  Both my parents passed away at a young age  my brother committed suicide in novemeber and turned my world upside down  I have been mostly a pot head since i was 14 am 24 now  it's better to get help while you can and please take my advice seriously because all i can say is when i was your age and i was starting to feel symptoms like this  it is no where near as bad as what i am feeling on a daily basis now  my god if i could turn back the time to experience the 19 y o me depression trust me i would  but I am not giving up  i am striving to feel that pleasure from daily life that I once felt a long time ago  you are loved by more people then you can think  please get help  do not be afraid to say your thoughts  but remember this you will benefit from natural ways of healing then taking meds believe me  my aunty is a pharmacist and i flew to asia from New Zealand to get Valium to deal with my head after my brothers passing   hope this helps   Lots of love xoxoxoxo
I brush my teeth twice a day every day and have been since I was a toddler  it's just mostly habit  I don't feel comfortable going to bed without brushing my teeth first    i just feel dirty otherwise 
Thank you  You may be getting a pm from me soon  Happy new year
I feel you   I had someone I used to be connected with message me that they missed me and apparently wanted to hang out   I couldn't on one day due to being stuck in bed with a hang over but I made this clear to them and then when I tried to send them messages  call them and add them   they flaked out on my efforts to be a friend without giving me a reason why then blocked me on New Years Eve because I was slightly frustrated by getting no response so basically said 'It seems like nobody is responding to me  so have a good one  peace ' as I was looking for someone to spend that evening with  If it weren't for my other friend who did respond and come down   I would have probably headed back home and spent that evening alone

I'm rarely on FB anymore   I periodically contact friends through messenger and visit a couple of groups   I can't handle the onslaught of fear and hate   
 I know not everybody has OCD so these things aren't a big deal to people  and I envy those people   I did mention that I do understand this is 'normal' behavior  in my own words kinda  and I know she didn't do it on purpose  but she certainly didn't avoid doing anything twice  even when I mentioned to her how much it bothered me  Just wanted to vent about not being 'normal' and the stress this caused     
Glad i'm not the only one  Sometimes it feels like I am  which is why reddit is great haha 
What agency was this    If you can find out any information  you can send their name and a report to higher ups in the organization  through email  phone  letter etc  just so they know this person is there and maybe do something about it   PLEASE KEEP TRYING TO GET HELP  If one organization doesn't work  try another  If one therapist is a jerk  try another  because then eventually you'll find the right help  That is was advocating for yourself means  willing to fight for what you deserve  such as humane mental health care   Her behavior does NOT reflect on you and your situation  She only knew you from a few minutes of talking on the phone  how could she be able to judge your life in any accurate way to even say if you're good to bad  She lied to you about one thing so you can't trust her anyway  Her opinion doesn't matter at all   I hope you start feeling better soon and are kind to yourself  My best way to fight off depression is focusing on caring for my whole wellbeing and making sure my body and mind have the best support i can give them   am I eating well   exercising  hanging out with people  sleeping ok  accomplishing anything  meditating  If not  if I improve those aspects  and my mental health inevitably improves    Depressed brain thinks these sound awful  but actually doing them fixes depressed brain  However  it's very hard to go against depressed brain so do not feel bad for being sick and unable to do so   Ex  I let myself eat junkfood when i'm too anxious to cook because i have to eat something  but I know it will hurt my mood if I don't eat well later   Any left over bad feelings I have after doing everything in my power to improve things are beyond my control  and I don't beat myself up for them   Please be kind to yourself  you deserve to not feel this way  3

She has to learn to control her emotions   This is not anxiety   
For the last couple of weeks I've been waking up in the wee hours of the morning anxious and panicky about various things  and then can't get back to sleep because I can't break the cycle of negative thoughts  The last couple of nights I've been listening to ambient nature sounds while I sleep  and it's been helping quite a bit  When I wake up anxious  it gives me something concrete but unobtrusive to focus on instead of the anxious  negative thoughts and really helps with calming me down and letting fall back asleep again   It's not perfect  I still eventually wake up and can't get back to sleep because of anxiety  but I've been hitting that point maybe an hour hour and a half before my alarm goes off instead of four hours before  so it is progress  It also doesn't seem to help as much during the day when my mind starts to wander in that direction  but by then I'm usually in a better position to find something distracting like TV  video games  reading  podcasts  etc   Another option is the podcast Sleep With Me  which is basically just a guy reading a boring story to help you fall asleep  It's geared more toward insomniacs  but I think it could serve the same purpose of providing something to focus on instead of the negative thoughts 
Hm    I believe I may just be spacing out a lot  Even still  I hope we both find ways to stay present  Meditation has really been a huge help through all of this  My physical symptoms have definitely abaded since I began meditating every day   
Its the job of the father to discipline kids who are being bullies   It isn't your job  Nothing pathetic about it  
Hey there  Ontarian here   It took me a good three years of trying to get on disability before I got it     But I was only in my twenties at the time of application so that could be a factor  I was also required to inquire if CPP can pay out any monies  If they can the disability rate will be adjusted   I didn't get it until it was almost too late  After losing my work  the chronic pain from car accidents  losing my vehicle to said accident  state of my relationship  I attempted suicide and ended up in the psych ward for a month  During that month in the hospital the doctors filled out all the forms for me and it was accepted within a week of being sent in  WTF  that perplexed the fuck out of me and kinda made me angry  Docs told me why  my psychiatrist at the time didn't want to give me a diagnosis of a mood disorder  but they had no problem diagnosing me with BP1   Anyways  my suggestion is if your wife needs to fill out her portion to explain what she deals with on the daily  she either leaves it blank  or writes out her very worst days  Hopefully her doc will do the same on their report   Like another poster suggested  a lawyer or advocacy group can also be helpful   Good luck to you both 
This is fucked up  I'm glad you're still here though
I would also confide in a trusted teacher or school counselor  They have resources to help you and your family and there is often a liaison for the school district that is there solely to help families in tough times  I do feel it would be remiss of me to not say that a teacher or counselor may call CPS or the police to follow up on the abuse claims  However  this may help your Mom to realize the seriousness of the situation    Keep your head up and make sure neithe you or your siblings are alone in a room with him 
I agree   "How are you " Usually is just Social greeting   Maybe friends and family mean it   Most of the time I just say ok   I do talk to my brother if things are totally off the hook     The other question I hate is " What are you doing these days "  Truth  not much   But  I have to come up with something valid   Ironically  having my therapist ask those questions makes me uncomfortable   He's wanting to know what's happening   It's hard to be vulnerable like that with anyone   I always want to cringe    Him  "How are you "   Me  "Ok "   Him  "Bullshit   How are you really "   Me    cringe     "      uh    "  
They're not pretty dumb problems but actually fairly reasonable and serious ones  Japan and Korea have staggering suicide rates because of those kinds of problems  Unfortunately it sounds like you're stuck in a corner as you're still at school and have to live with parents but is there anybody at all for you to talk to  And did posting it help you feel any better  If it did you could post more frequently and we can talk about it all a bit more  I don't know you from Adam but I'd hate for the world to lose you
Hey  I'm sorry you are going through this  ocd is an awful thing to go through especially when you recognise that you aren't acting rationally but still can't bring yourself to stop  have you sat down with your mum and asked her about what she feels might happen if she gets rid of the rubbish without cutting it up herself  She needs to come around to rational thought herself but you can prompt her with it  Because honestly they sound like unliveable situations for both of you but for her it's probably better than the thoughts of what will happen if she doesn't do it    I really hope this gets better for you and your mum  
We are two different people  Living in two different places  Thinking very different things  What worked for me  may not work for you      Think about the last thing you did that wasn't "the you that you want to be"  Really think about why you did it  what lead up to it  what was going through your head while it happened and then what you felt afterward  Next time you feel upset by someone  and you feel you need to do something in response that isn't "the you that you want to be" take a moment to make an active choice  will you conform to the past  or change your future right now  If changing your future doesn't sound like the best option then you don't want to change and you should accept that and mold your life to adapt to you  If you can make that change though  then it will be easier the next time  and the next  till one day you find out you are the person you want to be by habit  After that it's only speculation but I think you would be much more content in this world if you could honestly tell people that you like who you are and that others like you  Will you think about doing awful things to the ass holes that infest the surface of our planet  Yes  We all do  But if you can shake that person's hand and have even the worst of people think you're good company  you'll always be the better person 
Everyone's experience is different  but you are definitely not alone     I'm not sure why I found the CBT to be so distressing  but I did   I think its probably related to my comfort level with some of the rituals       I don't necessarily feel like they all have to go in order for me to be "better" but I really just wanted them to be more under control   I had a tough time with the premise of the particular CBT  as well   "I just explained to you how difficult doing  or not doing  X is   and you want me to deliberately make myself uncomfortable "      Medication has been good for me   I'm at a point now where I still perform some limited rituals but it is an insignificant part of my life in terms of cost  i e   time  social response  etc   
Hawwww man this brought tears to my eyes you bastard     P   I am sending you love and hugs   whatever you are going through my friend keep your head up  take one day at a time and pat yourself on the back when it is over    Life has many ups and downs   trials and tribulations   Now both my parents have passed away when i was a little boy  my brother committed suicide this november  I am 24 years of age    Now whats your fucking excuse   rhetorical   No matter how bad you think your life is   trust me there is alot of other people who are suffering a hell of a lot more  Turn that frown upside down  strive and prosper to be the best version of you    Lots of love xoxo
The major problem with this sub is that each post feels like a competition over who is "more depressed"  It's good people can relate to those thoughts and outbursts  but IMO they don't do depressed people much good and if anything reinforce those negative feelings    I've attempted to just start conversations to discuss how we feel from one depressed person to another  but that rarely goes anywhere   TL DR  if you want to reinforce the fact you are depressed then visit r depression  
Damn  My loss of interest of everything has taken over  and it feels like a chore to do anything 
It's not you  it's them  Trust me  you had no reason to be treated like this  as you said  " Not once did I swear or make a threat or take jabs   ANYTHING like that  I don't know what I did to be treated that way "  The suicide hotline already has a bad reputation  never call them again  I knew they were idiots even though I never called them  FUCK them  You shouldn't ever call them  
At your age 6 months of exercise will put you in the top 20  looks wise   I had an undiagnosed severe dust allergy and was always very sick missing a third of school days   In college I started playing basketball and decided to stop reveling in my sickness and ignore it     I started  r bodyweightfitness to get better at basketball and a year later I was running around shirtless and women were always touching me and flirting with me   
I know how you feel my friend  what you are experiencing is nothing short of what is called life  it has its ups and downs  joy wouldnt feel so good if it wasnt for pain    remember to take each day one at a time  and at the end of that day pat yourself on the back for doing so  do not be afriad to tell the people around you that you are going through a rough patch  express your emotions communication is key   keep a cool temper  untill you have fully exhausted your means of communicating with people you have nothing to fear my brother   sending love and hugs to you xoxo
It's even more sad that I'm going to go out by killing myself  There's no doubt about it 
Interesting  thanks  Worth a try   
There's being supportive and then there's being judgmental   People here offer feedback   The point behind it is to support each other   I've seen many posts along the lines of "this helped me   Have you tried    "   One of the issues many of us face is feeling isolated and alone in depression   Even having someone else share their experiences can help   
Anxiety is the uncontrolled stress response and thoughts   Its not the particular thing you think you are worrying about   if it isn't this it will be something else   If your sleep is disturbed this is a major health issue and you need to see a doctor 
I would tell your boyfriend how you feel but I don't think it's reasonable to have him stop hanging out with his friends  If you really don't want to be around them than i would hope that your boyfriend would be understanding  
Thank you for your kind words  Depression is a daily battle one must not give up   Am trying to spread my wisdom to all of those in this subreddit feeling desperate and unsure where to turn    xoxo
I think it's worth apologizing if you think it will help you and your ex  If you think it might hurt someone  don't do it  
Good to know  Another reason for me to avoid hotlines  Instead I will call a close friend if I ever get to that stage  Oh    wait    I have no friends   
I don't want to sound like a textbook psychiatrist I'm not even remotely qualified  but   I like you  You sound driven but sometimes when you give people one hand  they bite off both  Moving to a new city was something I considered but as you found out  problems seem to just follow you  do you do this hobby with anyone else  Hobbies usually seem to involve other people being reasonably encouraging towards each other  If you feel like having a chat then send along a PM  congratulations on your award by the way
I'm in the same boat  I've had  relatively mild  anxiety all my life and figured I had a good enough handle on it on my own  but the last couple weeks it spiked really badly and I haven't been dealing with it well   I have an appointment with a therapist next week  but it feels unbearably far away sometimes  Just hanging around here for a few days I found a couple of tricks to help me cope with it until then  and it feels like a godsend  I hope you have similar luck 
You are in control in that you just have to stop feeding your anxiety and get off the computer   It does feel good to conquer an anxiety and you should always be aware of and address any anxiety that has progressed to a point where you are hurting yourself 
In my country a lot of those working on a hotline are volunteers 
Im so so sorry to hear of your loss  Grief can be more complex when meshed in with mood disorders  so be kind to yourself  There are no expectations to grief  we all move at our own speed  in our own ways   One person starts off with anger  another with depression  another with laughter  It's ok to feel the way you do  or nothing at all   All you can do is let yourself go through the motions  Talk to people us  If you need someone with you because of self harm suicide try to have other family around    If you visit your local emergency department they most likely have resources for those grieving and can point you to group meetings if thats something you'd be insterested in 
Therapy is what helps OCD 
Thanks   It will probably help that her pdoc is the one who treated her when she was admitted for her first manic episode    6 weeks in the hospital    and has given a diagnosis of BP with psychotic elements   
We can't provide diagnostic advice  but I do want to say that mania is  pretty much by definition  outside off what a normal person might do  Lithium is not bad at all compared to what happens when you're manic 
I am lucky to have played with fire so many times and not been burnt  Have had access to alot of valium over the last couple of years only thing is that I have to travel overseas to asia and see my aunty who owns a chemist  despite that she has given me the strongest dose and the amount of 100 in each box  doesnt question me when I ask for 2 boxs also which is like a good 1   years prescription for the average person and ill smash these bad boys in 3 months usually    I know everytime I take these it is taking a part of me that i will never get back  but I must make that sacrifice so that i can feel what humanity i have left  everytime i start running low or know that i need to cut out there is a strict routing that i find very usefull its essentially liek rebuilding yourself  can not neglect the simple things in life   First of all you need to stop eating shit food  i know its easy and tasty but cut it out it's not gonna help you on your road to recovery  thats fine if you can only eat a small amount but PLEASE make it real food like fruit or vegetables  nothing too carby  Second of all is to do some sort of exercise  I know your situation and its fucken hard believe me Ive been experiencing this for years now and no one is gonna help you   if you cant help yourself  All you have to do is go for a 10 15 minute walk  let your thoughts run through your mind  you need to strengthen your muscles retrain them to where they once were at  even if you come back and you feel tired thats fine  take a nap you will feel better mentally for going out   trust me  I even found hill running to cure alot of my depression   i would sit at work googling running techniques  "how running cured my depression" and it's amazing  but ill stop ranting about that    third thing is to start doing some strecthing  just youtube yoga lower body back pain  something like that you will find you are getting pain in your legs because the muscles are becoming weak and they are picking up extra slack  an imbalance in the body in other words  a foam roller has saved me for many years of just lying in bed for most days  and doing yoga   24 year old male    Now whatever you are thinking about your life  it is not bad at all  this is the part of the process were you can prevent alot of negative things happening as long as you are pro active in noticing these changes and dealing with them one step at a time  Both my parents passed away at a young age  my brother committed suicide in novemeber and turned my world upside down  I have been mostly a pot head since i was 14 am 24 now  it's better to get help while you can and please take my advice seriously because all i can say is when i was your age and i was starting to feel symptoms like this  it is no where near as bad as what i am feeling on a daily basis now  my god if i could turn back the time to experience the 19 y o me depression trust me i would  but I am not giving up  i am striving to feel that pleasure from daily life that I once felt a long time ago  you are loved by more people then you can think  please get help  do not be afraid to say your thoughts  but remember this you will benefit from natural ways of healing then taking meds believe me  my aunty is a pharmacist and i flew to asia from New Zealand to get Valium to deal with my head after my brothers passing   hope this helps  Lots of love xoxoxoxo 
You clearly don't understand how texting works  If you want to speak to them fucking call them 
How the fuck do they go about their lives knowing that they could've killed someone 
If you feel comfortable talking with him her  then yes 
I haven't  I'll try it  I had this wooden coaster on my bedside desk  I ended up just gripping that to keep me grounded to reality  It helped a lot  
Hehe it started early for you  but anxiety really hits at major points in your life   End of high school and end of college are huge ones  I would suggest you change your frame though   it isn't the college that matters   What matters is the job and life    What do you want to do   Find people doing that and talk to them about it   Talk to business owners and learn about different jobs   Do internships now    If you get stuck on this it will be more productive  
Yep  I've let it happen for minutes on end but it just stays  And it's too terrifying to let it happen any longer   
Taking it day by day
I hope your year gets better  You aren't garbage  and someone out there loves you I know it  
If you learnt any coping mechanisms in therapy utilize them when you can  If not I'd possibly recommend contacting your GP  
I fixed this by looking in the mirror and saying I love you for a year   I now never cringe when thinking back   I smile and love myself   I could not have been 'better' than what I was in the past   I'm sick and that is part of me   Who cares    You can also walk outside and smile at things   Spend time around other people and smile at them   Being positive around other people will cause them to be happier which will reflect back on you   Bake cookies for people  Etc 
Your muscles get tense   This is the fight or flight response   Massage is one way to relax 
I really want to know answer to this question as well  I heard that rationalizing would help  You can concentrate on doing your job better  As time passes I hope that you will get more comfortable about being around this guy  Also  are you sure that he is single  
Wonderful  I'm sorry that you're going through this 
As much as I thought about it the pre recorded workout programs didn't cross my mind  Thank you so much for dropping the workout plans suggestions  saves me a ton of time as now I have a place to start looking from    Equipment seems to be managable  I am glad that I rent a big apartment albeit from what you tipped me to it seems that it is quite easy to start off  Thanks   a lot   for spending your time writing it  Gave me a nice kick and a lot of hope   
yep    i suck at making new friendships  mainly only meet people through my social friends that i do have
You are welcome  I am glad to help
Same here 
Both my parents passed away at a young age  my brother committed suicide in novemeber and turned my world upside down  Believe me when I say things get better  there was a time in my life even when my parents were gone were i found peace and tranquility in a daily basis   such as yourself I was gifted and excelled at studies  but my grades started to slip as life threw more curveballs at me and my parents were no longer with me to help me through them    what are your hobbies  are you into computers  music  instruments  sports   Do you smoke pot  have been smoking pot since i was 14   am 24 now  i remember the first time i tried it  and it suddenly just made everything better  thats the only way that I could really explain it to people  it just made the boring less boring  and the pain less painfull  call it escapism  but it help me to get as far as i am now  and to be the caring thoughtfull person that i am    Sending you love and hugs xoxo 
I wasn't trying to be a dick or anything  I was just saying scary things can happen when we don't take care of our teeth  I totally understand where you're coming from  I really do  Hygiene can be really hard to manage with depression  My family member dying has given me a bit of a push to stay on top of my teeth  It's scary  
Thank you Nathaniel for taking the time to answer me  and for your kind words     This is the first time I have heard of sensory pillows  I looked them up and I will definitely be getting one now  I often call my cat over so I can pet and snuggle her after I wake up  and that helps  so I see how the pillow could be a lifesaver  The video game thing  that doesn't sound weird to me at all because I'm a gamer myself and have actually had dreams which got better after they took on a more "video game y" vibe  if that makes any sense  Like I have control over what happens instead of being along for the ride  I guess I'm not the only one  I will look into the light thing as well  My son has a very cool nightlight he no longer uses that I'll try putting on my bedside table  It has a very soft glow   Thanks again  It may sound silly but I feel a lot less alone than I did before I posted this 
I read that and had the same reaction as you  I can't believe that people had to spell it out for them  Emetophobia or not  who wants to be in a room with vomit in it  Ugh 
i smoked weed since i was 14  now 23  i smoked about half oz a week  every day  through a bong  mixed with tobacco  id say i was very anxious and a bit depressed before i started but yeah hard to say  felt like ive been smoking my whole life 
Yeah it seems to run in cycles and I'm not sure why  Last week I started cleaning and thought yeah I'll blitz this place and have a great summer but it ends up sinking me a few days later and I end up sitting in the shower with my eyes closed wishing it all away

  If I STAY in bed  whether from hangover  depression  or both  I think I'm going to "sleep myself better" but in fact it never fucking happens  So I have to admit   after years of this shit   that I am wrong   I do this very thing all the time  I did it just this morning  actually  It took me a few hours of a pity party to admit that it wasn't working  So off I went  
I defiitely understand not feeling any different than I did back in high school  That's actually when all my problems started  I guess I wasn't self aware enough of my problems to be one of those depressed awkward teens that got help  I was always satisfied with what I now understand were simply distractions from life  I actually transformed from depressed nobody to deadbeat loser stoner and knowing that's how I'm seen by most people who know me is a particulary harsh reality to have to come to terms with 
Thank you for your post  I agree that accepting anxiety rather than fighting it can help  
If ovarian or cervical cancer runs in your family you can request a transvaginal ultrasound which would show immediately if there were any suspected problems  This in conjunction with a Pap smear will help rule out any cancers    You should be having regular exams and Pap smears to make sure everything is functioning as expected  this would help to lessen anxiety    These types of cancers run in my family so I have to have that ultrasound regularly  It's not fun but helps to immediately rule out some things    Hope this helps some  
What's funny is that every time that happens I think to myself "maybe I was not ill  I was probably just lying to myself  I was just really sad  I'm not ill  because I feel ok now  I still feel a little weird  I feel on the inside  something  but I'm okay  not ill  I was just making it all up"    That is what I think  every time  and then it comes back in full force and I do not know what to believe in anymore  I am not sure if I am just sad often majority of my life or if I am ill of depression  I don't know  I may be lying to myself to make my failures in life easier  excuses  but I just don't know anymore  the line kinda blurs and I can't trust myself anymore   This circle is just really screwing it up  I cannot tell anymore if I'm getting better  worse or if I am still the same or if I am okay and I am just making it all up in my head  it's unclear 
People need to stop judging  Seriously 
So true   
Not pathetic you sound victim to a series of circumstances out with your control and it's tearing you up  I don't think I can help or offer advice but I'm genuinely wishing you all the best for 2017 and I hope you hang in there  don't hate yourself because of other people's feelings towards who you are or unrequited love 
If you don't feel right about your current therapist  get another therapist 
my man  you do not need to compare yourself to others  this is where your line of thoughts plague your mind  there is nothing wrong with how many times you have been on a date  or whether your social media is popping off  fuck that shit  doesnt mean shit  you know why  because social media is some stupid bull shit where you see a photo of someone who supposedly likes you if its tinder  and a robot like generated message with an opening line  i know plenty of dudes who are good looking that still get 0 off that sort of stuff so stop cutting yourself short and comparing yourself to others   your future wife is probably thinking the same thing right now to her self   did you ever think that  when your dad was your age he was living in a different time  that was the norm to get married at a young age and settle down  it's an option but its not your only option remember that   We are all unique   I lost my virginity when i was 14   went out with that girl for 3 years  met the love of my life for 1 year  then had a bunch of flings with not so important girls but i can recall loving these girls because they were so beautiful  i havent had sex in 5 years since I was 19  yeah call it depression or not giving a fuck  but i know when the time is right it will happen naturally I am training myself to find someone who i can see the qualities i have in me in them also  which is hard to find in this day and age of time were everyone is so retarded from social media    think of it this way bro  girls are fucken trouble  do you want to experience what its like having a GF and she goes out clubbing with other girls and guys  and she gets shit faced drunk   youll be staying up all night texting her and youll never really know what shes doing behind your back  thats the reality of dating these days   i know this from experience because I was the one doing shit behind the girls back cause i was greedy and selfish   xoxo
  It's just a "try it and see "  To be fair  AAPs are a serious type of medication class  Last time my doc told me to 'try and see' an AAP  I got a side effect never heard of  I got focal dystonia  akathisia  and dysphonia  I lost my voice  reduced to a whisper for a good six months  lost my job  my hobbies  my life  Had to do speech therapy just so I can communicate effectively again  Almost two years later I still struggle with my speech  let alone the dystonia   Yea I was experiencing signs of psychosis but honestly my life is now worse off than it was before trying the med  These are meds that can cause permanent and severe types of side effects  Thats a lot to ask for a patient to accept 
I like it  sorry for this disease we all share that's made you feel this way but you're good at shaping it 
Hi ickycat  Thanks for your message   I've asked her this many many times over the years  She will barely acknowledge that there is a fear behind it   I think she is afraid of losing something  but I'm not sure that would be a strong enough reason to keep doing this    I do understand that living with whatever fear is causing this going around your mind must be awful  I'd just like to be able to see into it so I could try to help somehow 
Only if it will make you feel better or move forward  Ex has already figured out your behavior for themselves and made their own assumptions about it  It wouldn't hurt too bad to just say something like "Hey I'm doing better with bipolar now and I just wanted to say that  stuff that happened  was because I was not well  I wasn't in control of my behavior because I was having an episode but I wanted to apologize anyway  Sorry I  did whatever I did  "    Once I was stable I apologized to my ex husband  He accepted that my behavior was because of a condition and accepted the apology  He also apologized for some of his behaviors that led to the divorce   no matter what  bipolar or not  it takes TWO people to end something  We had a long talk about why we didn't work out  like a 4 hour one  In the end he did make it very clear that a relationship was not possible again because he couldn't take the risk of going through all that again  I said I wasn't looking for that and we finally moved on with our lives and we haven't spoken again  This conversation was 2 years after the divorce  
I can relate to pushing people away  But your story gives me hope     
thanks    nice to know im not the only one  i also get a few valium  handful at a time prescribed by doctor  and they make me feel so great  i wish i could be on that valium high all the time  but they can be very addictive so i hope you're careful with them    i am gunna try to keep pushing through without weed  psychs are poxy  last one i went to told me to look in the mirror and say "i love you" and dumb shit like that   self confidence wasn't even my issue at the time  anyways best of luck thx again for your comment    xo
Thanks I ll try my best 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU SIR    How old are we today   Sorry to hear you are having troubles with your friends  it happens  blame social media its fucken made everyone dumb   heres a quick solution  dont text them  RING THEM  you will get an honest answer from their mouth hopefully it is a positive one    or see or ask them in person to hang out    all the best xoxo

I have the most addictive personality  i toked a joint last night and all i could think of is MORE MORE MORE   i think i should stay off the shit  cheers
Yeah this doesn't sound like anxiety just sounds like a really high maintenance person  Ask her exactly how she feels when she's having these feelings  Does she feel like she's panicking or just angry because it sounds like she's just really picky about EVERYTHING and kind of a control freak  Talk to her about needing to control it because I don't think people get set off that frequently and with that many different triggers    Anxiety for me is all mental though so I dunmo take everything I say with a grain of salt  When I'm "triggered" is when I realize that some thing I havent done yet needs to get done  And I will dread doing it until it's done  Talking to my family is the worst trigger lol

Aw  im so happy I was able to help  
I'm sorry that these things happened to you  Regardless of your siblings mental health the trauma that you endured was real and has affected you  I agree with your partner that you should seriously consider opening up to your therapist about your sexual trauma  Addressing those early incidents of abuse could help to explain how you chose to cope and how your health has been affected   It's never easy to break the silence about traumatic experiences with someone  You might try writing what you want to say in a letter to your therapist and taking that with you to a session  The important thing is that you are ready to share this and that you feel comfortable talking with your therapist about it  If you feel judged or uneasy during your sessions  ask for a referral to another therapist  You will be more successful in healing and recovery if you feel safe with and supported by your therapist   Take good care of yourself 
What are you doing these days slays me  it's like an instant conversation killer that screws with your mood

I am sorry to hear this one of the worst things a child can experience is their parent not being able to see eye to eye   You know what  fuck em  if they cant see your point of view  why should you keep caring  just ignore them  or just say what you need to say without putting up a fit   please do not say you are going to jump off a cliff  over this  cmon   both my parents died of cancer and i watched them when i was 14 years old  my brother committed suicide last november at the age of 24  life throws a lot of curve balls  some we can deal with   others we must run from and seek refuge untill the pain goes away  if it goes away  life has so much more to offer you   please do not take that for granted  not everyone will see eye to eye as you and that is the beauty of your soul  lots of love and hugs to you xoxoxoxo
Sounds less like a need to control your ambitions and more a need to plan out and follow through with them    take some risks  roll the dice  you might just find you can achieve what you dream 
I think that's a good goal  
Become a cashier  I did and it's an easy job for being depressed for me  You work alone at the till but you have coworkers  You do some small talk with customers but they always leave you alone once they paid

I think only you know your relationship with your ex and what you want to come out of it  There's probably no need to go in and re hash anything specifically hurtful  but apologies go a long way  Even if the other person has already compartmentalized your actions in the past  if they heard from you that you were sincerely sorry and wish them the best in the future  it may help them re close those memories with a happier tone    I've personally gone back and apologized to friends from many years ago in school for my previous actions  It may have been selfish on my end initially because I wanted to fix things  but I have made amends with those people and have built a whole new adult friendship with them    Good luck with however you move forward 
fuck reddits shitty formatting
Thanks but I most certainly am garbage  and nobody loves me and my year probably won't get better  
Well stated  
Yep absolutely  I'm surprised how many posts share my feelings in a world where people look at me like I'm some sort of outcast criminal 
Honestly  when I'm hanging out with them I still enjoy what they have to say  we have the same taste in movies and music and they are really funny  it's just I cannot muster up the confidence to try to crack a joke or even contribute to the conversation  They are good friends and they have tried to put up with me  but nobody wants to hang out with the kid who has nothing to say ever 
Fantastic  I know everytime I take these it is taking a part of me that i will never get back  but I must make that sacrifice so that i can feel what humanity i have left  everytime i start running low or know that i need to cut out there is a strict routing that i find very usefull its essentially likd rebuilding yourself  can not neglect the simple things in life   Glad to hear that you are going to keep pushing through brother  it wont be easy  but at the end of it think of how amazingly strong you will be  then you can help others that will be in the situation that you were once in how amazing of a gift is that   That psychiatrist sounds fucken stupid  that is not going to solve anything  Getting to the root of any problem is a place to start what a load of crock   you just have to keep at it man  dont give up   just dont  would love to hear from you in the future    xoxo
This is not on you  Sometimes I internalize blame when someone does me wrong  but that is another habit that contributes to depression  The people working at that hotline clearly don't have appropriate training and lack empathy  It says nothing about you  nothing

light at the end of the tunnel even for the worst of us   3 good work brutha  you sound like one strong mf 
"I don't exactly have a lot of problems making friends or talking to girls"  This is not social anxiety  This is your basic high school crush 
I feel like that a lot  I still do things though and push through  Sometimes it helps and I feel a bit motivated but sometimes it doesn't   at least a few chores get done and I feel less shitty about it  
I'm looking for these also   I was diagnosed back in 1997 and have since tried to "man up" about it but I've been in a suicidal state for the past 10 years at least as I hate meds   I'm not even sure why I'm still here  but I'm still fighting   I wish the best for everyone and please know you don't suffer alone and hang in there   I just recently lost my job and I'm on the verge of being homeless   I honestly don't know where I can get help here in AZ   
I went to see a therapist early last year because my boyfriend at the time threatened to break up with me if I didn't  That relationship didn't work out  I didn't make much progress and I moved too far away from my therapist to keep seeing her  It took me a few months after I moved to finally reach out after I had a panic attack in front of my current boyfriend and kept having uncontrollable crying  I had to wait a little over a month after that to finally get in to see a psychiatrist  
As a 17 year old who loves to travel but gets anxiety flying  in crowds  in unfamiliar places  etc     thank you  I hope to have some similar experiences on my own one day   thanks for the inspiration   Keep killin it    
I absolutely adored this  I also suffer from anxiety but sometimes am able to find freedom in visiting new places  though flying is very difficult for me   So happy to see below that my hometown of D C  welcomed you with open arms  
Same thing happen to me I think it took 2 and half months before I actually got to see a therapist  Depending on the time year determines how long you wait I think  
I don't believe that you are being over sensitive  It sounds to me like your grandmother was not at all sensitive towards you if you were often hearing his voice on the phone over the years   I suggest that you talk to your grandmother about this when she brings up his name in conversation  Yes  she has fond memories of him but he did abuse you and caused your health to suffer  She should be made aware that you would prefer not to hear about him  If his name comes up occasionally that's different  Certainly she can recall fond memories while you are not visiting with her   If she puts any blame on you for her partner's criminal behavior or refuses to consider your feelings  then you might seriously consider spending less time with your grandmother   You might also consider talking with a trauma therapist in order to gain support and validation   Take good care of yourself 
I hated myself for a long time because I was ashamed of the things I did as a kid  I also had a heap of Catholic guilt which made me so unhappy with myself  I was also fat  I did the ol' pros cons lists  I fixed a few things but I'm not in love with myself  I barely like myself but at least I'm not hating myself    I do a gratitude and courageous acts lists daily  if I can but it's usually pretty sporadic  Maybe we can both try a 'things I like about myself" list  
I second this  Writing down your thoughts will help you organize them  I would try yoga or reading to help calm your mind  
They are supposed to be supportive and helpful  a good therapist shouldn't negate your feelings  Your feelings exactly why you want someone to talk to   I see one for anxiety  and we spend most of the time talking about what's made me anxious since the last time we talked  and how to feel a little less anxious in the future  You're probably your harshest critic  so if the therapist ever says something along the lines of "you're wrong " they're probably telling you the feelings you have ARE normal and valid  That's possibly the best part of seeing a therapist  you get someone in your life that validates your feelings  and helps you deal with them 
First  I want to address the gun thing  I don't have the means to get one as easily as you do  but I totally have fantasies about blowing my head apart with a shotgun  and being perfectly fine with it  right then and there throughout the day  I totally get having that nagging  grim solution pop into your head all the time  It's important that you continue to fight this urge  Now  clearly  like me  you aren't feeling good about your lifestyle  Well  from one stoner to another  let me tell you that quitting marijuana for good or at least a very long time is going to help improve your situation drastically  This isn't a new idea for you  I'm sure  but it is without a doubt the best thing for your health right now  You'll be in better shape for not smoking  feel a lot less sorry for yourself   probably  begin to feel better sober  and feel sharper  depression weed habit  major brain fog   Same goes for porn  except thaf you should give that shit up for good  If it hasn't made you sexually impotent with a women yet  it will eventually  Smoking you can pick back up once you feel your life coming back together  happy people smoke all the time  enjoy it more  and do it more responsibly  i e  not all the time  and at more appropriate times     The last thing I wanted to add is excercise a lot more and eat better  You said you were in decent shape  Get in fucking GREAT shape  Run a mile everyday  be able to do 100 pushups in a sitting  pull ups even  Be able to swim a mile or more straight  I find fitness goals particularly rewarding  and I barely feel anything at all  emotionally  99 99  of the time 
Thanks for posting     Legally moving out    I'm under the age of 16 so I cannot legally move out yet   Probably untrue   You can probably legally move in with a grandparent  cousin  aunt  uncle  or other relative   You might also be able to legally move in with a friend   Finally  you might also be able to legally move into a domestic violence shelter   But it might be helpful to your youngest sister if you stayed with her instead of moving away from her     Money    If my father were to be imprisoned  or die  I know for a fact that my mother would not be able to support our family on her income  which makes me sick to my stomach and nervous for the future   If your mom can't afford to pay her rent or mortgage  you guys may eventually have to move to a smaller place  or you may have to move in with relatives   This may be majorly disruptive but is not the end of the world   Peanut butter and jam sandwiches are kind of boring but pretty cheap   Try every flavor of jam   If money's really tight  omit the jam   If your mom can't afford any food at all  you can visit food banks and get free food there   Or you can visit drop in centers  soup kitchens  and eat free meals   Food is plentiful in America     Your father    he attempted suicide the day after admitting this to my mother but failed  He might be in severe depression   I think it would be good if he could survive the depression  maybe he can get better   He should first visit a doctor or hospital and get help with the depression   He can go to Sex Addicts Anonymous or a sex addiction therapist later on     Some questions    I don't know how this could end or what to do  A   Have you yet visited the  prefs panel  https   www reddit com prefs   and enabled "Send messages as emails" for this throwaway   B   Does your youngest sister ever sleep in a room by herself 
Hey girl  Its really sound like youre going to need therapy and possibly some medication for anxiety  Have you talked to your parents about either of those things   Im sending you my positive vibes  3

Fuckin A right  Being socially awkward anxious might as well be a death sentence  where you're expected to do the killing  
Thanks a ton   
Thanks a lot buddy    
Thank you for your advice  It's good to know that running has helped you so much  Working out helped me a lot way back  but I had a bad experience with a friend and now whenever I go to the gym and lift I think of him  It used to be so positive  and now it makes me feel anxious and think of things I should have left behind      What you said kind of scared me in a way  I can believe that this kind of depression maybe isn't so bad  I've only felt real internally generated pain once in recent memory  and that was so bad I was sleeping to get away from it  Now  I'm coasting  and the worst I see of it is when I try and get off the antidepressants and see what things look like "under the bandages" as it were    Turns out  not great  Not as bad as it was at its worst  but I'm not better    I feel like I'm mostly "treated"  but the antidepressants are working less and less well as I get lazier about my lifestyle  I'm becoming more insular and homebound  and I have less time for people winding me up or being generally annoying  That scares me and I want to stop relying on the meds before they stop working completely  Guess I can't  though    I hope I can make lifting work for me again  I know the person who hurt me never meant to make me give up  I took up running like you  but it's hard when the roads are icy    Sheesh    Minds like raw eggs  the least little thing can put a crack in them  Do you find you're kind of weirdly tough in some ways  yet so easy to mess with in others

What I hate is when you can't hide your depression from other people due to your body language  so they actually do kind of mean "how are you" in a slightly concerned sort of way  It's like fuck now I've attracted someone else's pity  which I fuckin hate  
There is nothing your doctor hasn't heard before  Tell them what you've just said here and be as honest as you can be  I hope you are able to get some help 
Last time I was off for any length of time  I lost my job  Took me an afternoon  Arrived at work  got more and more down  a customer picked on me for looking down  and I snapped at her  Fired  
Could the police put him in jail for "break and enter" or for "assault and battery" even if she asks the police not to   Would they   It seems to me that it would be unwise for any police to allow any axe wielding meth addicts to roam free 
Honestly don't let that get you down   Some people there suck ass   So what   Just keep calling until you find a calm nice person   Also  only limit your talking to 10 min   Then they start getting mean   They try to rush you off the phone 
I love music and it makes me feel better  There's so much I could write down  Unfortunately  I don't recognise anything you mentioned   I YouTube'd surrenderdorothy  Makes me think of radiohead mixed with brand new  I like the lo fi and voice overs    I like listening to music I can sing with or stuff I grew up listening to  It's nostalgic  Like Taking Back Sunday  Bright Eyes  Minus the Bear

Just do weed at night so that you won't be under the influence for a job in the day   Weed is amazing   I hope you don't have to give it up completely   I personally use indica edibles to sleep   It feels so great  
That's shitty  I've been having a lot of up and down days recently because of my "fuck these pills" attitude and being in the military just makes things a lot worse 
I fell in love with my best friend  She didn't feel the same 
It's such a shame  the person I'm talking about is truly a wonderful and loyal person    As far as I know  they're not drinking or smoking  Their body doesn't allow them to  they would vomit it out by the second they drink  It's just them and their loneliness  although they were tempted 
Making the goals instead of ambitions  The method I learned in school was make goals specific  measurable  achievable  realistic  and timely    I daydream a lot and I get all these great ideas and plan things out but then I have to work at superstore and they get swept away    I have to give myself reality checks  Like  "hey I know you like animals but you're never going to have a giant farm  become a veterinarian  and have a hugely successful animal rescue business  It was a cool idea but you have to calm down and go to sleep"
If weed was legitimately the source of your problems then I'd say no  Honestly my opinion is that you shouldn't smoke if you aren't already legitimately happy  You already quit  and if your anything like me  it will rapidly become the habit it used to be  I need to stop but I can't because  like with a lot of other people here  at least I feel SOMETHING when high  I guess "can't" is an overstatement but it's fuckin hard to let go of when you're depressed  
I would ask him why the hesitancy to change the formal diagnosis   If you are being treated with Bipolar meds and they are effective  then ergo you are Bipolar right   As far as I know  you don't treat depression and GAD with lamictal   It is possible he doesn't want to change it from depression and GAD to Bipolar until he can narrow down where on the spectrum you are  I  II  NOS  cyclothymic     In the end though you are right in that it matters less what "label" he gives you and more that the treatment is effective   
It's been a long time since I have been in high school but I used to be able to sit on the sidelines and do my homework during PE  As long as they saw I was being productive  no one cared  and I still got a passing grade in PE all of the years of my high school career using it as a study hall  Definitely talk to a counselor about your options  
You are doing the right thing by looking for and seeing a therapist  Finding one that works for you can be difficult and you'll need to keep seeing people until you find someone you can work with   When finding a therapist look for one that specializes in trauma  PTSD and EMDR  A good therapist will need to work with you over several years  not just a couple months   If you feel the need to medicate yourself please see a psychiatrist  Drugs like MDMA are probably not helping you given your state of mind    If you cannot find help there are some excellent books and websites about PTSD and trauma  I'm reading Healing Trauma by Peter Levine right now  Very good but challenging    Finally  find others you can talk to about this  Posting here is a good way to start  Maybe there's a PTSD support group in your city  The more you know about the illness the better     
Actually yes  my great grandfather was arrested and killed by communists and his family my grandfather was 7 then  was deported to Siberia   Here  https   en wikipedia org wiki Soviet repressions of Polish citizens  193946   is an article about it  under mass deportations to East  
I don't think that's very good for your health tbh

Suicidal thoughts increased for a long span of time  self harm actions increased  and I developed a new symptom of anxiety  a tic which was hurting my muscles  making me sore  and made me feel like a freak   The medicine I'm on now has helped loads and it was easy to obtain  I'm so much happier now

Most nights I am kept awake by all the embarrassing things I've done and horrible imaginations of people turning on me  I too have a artificial Christmas tree that looks pretty in the dark  It makes me feel a warm glow of christmas y cheer  
ive never taken anti depressants im sorry that i cannot help you in that area  but I'm sure that you are noticing the effects that they are having on you and im glad that you are trying to better yourself in this situation  pat yourself on the back    I know what its like to stay at home   heck points in my life I wouldnt leave my home for weeks  maybe months at a time  Recently I wouldnt even walk down the street to go to the shops unless one my of my flat mates came with me  i just dont like being alone i guess or maybe people wont notice me as much if im not by myself social anxiety i guess  but i can comfortably run across to the road and up the hill for some exercise with out caring  funny that   Of course they never meant to make you give up   or even cause that degree of pain  dont let old memories ruin you trying to better yourself because its one of the only options you have  its like the thought of the gym is actually worst then going to the gym  once youre there it's manageable  maybe give yourself 10 minutes on cardio equipment  if you make it past the 10  do another 10  if you make it to 20 minutes and youre feeling good   stay for another 10  small increments at a time is a good place to start  I just feel huge amounts of anxiety being in public places  especially the gym which is stupid but once my blood starts pumping i dont want to leave its all about just tricking my brain that nothing bad is gonna happen    I find I take things too personally   some of my friends are rather blunt then  and it feels like they are attacking me with some of the things they say  in reality they arent attacking me they are treating me the same as all of their other friends its just my warped perception makes me feel hurt  i dont like confrontation  definitely weridly tough  you have to be mate  living in the world we live in  but so susceptible in many ways too   lots of love 
I love calling a cab  normally the driver is really nice and we have an entertaining conversation    Hope you find your girl and cheers   
i used to smoke only after work  but when i wasn't working i was always high  i found it gradually killed my motivation for working  yeah it sucks when you're already in a bad place to quit  thought it would help my life but eh  too late i guess  i toke a joint and all i can think of is smoking a bong   addictive personality
So  I'm still not good at this  but my best advice is to see anyone as a person first  and attractive second   Everyone  even beautiful people  have flaws  and they're own inner monologue  and self doubts  and pretty much anything else that hits at your confidence  They also do most the same things we all do  which means they've had bad days and embarrassing moments too  And  most of them have normal hobbies and interests that we mere mortals also enjoy  Humanizing them should make it easier to connect with them  They're just people  even if they're also living Greek statues   Again  this is something I still struggle with  but I think most of the anxiety people get from being around attractive people is caused by putting them on some pedastal  We're all just people  and we all deal with same shit

I did that once it turned out bad I'm not very friendly when I'm down  
Food is my go to feel good thing but it pains me because I'm on a strict budget and trying to maintain my weight  I have unsuccessfully coped with buying other stupid things I don't need  too much cannabis  and gaming  I've gone to buy junk food at superstore many times and stared at the stuff I want to buy but always have to walk out empty handed and more sad  Why can't food stop giving me pleasure 
Greetings  It sounds like this was a difficult thing for you to write but I think it's really good you're opening up and discussing it  I have a lot of sympathy for folks whose parents had these issues  as my mother  too  had a bit of a hoarding problem  It wasn't quite as bad as some of the extreme cases you see on tv  and it sounds like it wasn't as bad as you're currently experiencing  but even that was quite hard to live with  So I can empathize  and I know how frustrating it is to have to live in clutter when you're a naturally tidy person  I find it literally jams up my thinking   like  I find it harder to concentrate in a messy room with too much visually going on  It can be a real pain in the ass   I think it's important to say two particular things  1  Hoarding  strictly  this problem is usually classified as Hoarding Disorder rather than OCD  though the two are closely linked  is a curable and fixable disorder    2    but not by 'reasoning' or 'logic' ing your mother out of it  If that makes any sense   The problem with stuff like hoarding  or any other addiction  obsession or phobia  is that it's not really caused by having the wrong rational thoughts as such  People don't ACTUALLY believe that losing all their money on a gambling addiction  filling the entire house up with garbage  washing their hands fifty times or running away screaming from a harmless spider are logically clever ideas  Folks with these problems aren't delusional  I'm sure your mother isn't either  However  there's something going in with the more subconscious parts of the brain  the bits that deal with primitive fears and raw emotions  that's skewing someone's perception to make them end up in these situations  And often their brains are literally wired differently or temporarily slightly damaged   this article explaining how hoarder's brains are actually different to regular folks' in brain scans  might be useful to you    https   blogs scientificamerican com observations scans of hoarders brains reveal why they never de clutter      But the problem IS fixable  with proper therapy and support  Your mother isn't stuck like this  Brains are very changeable  if you do the right therapy  and you can learn to think and feel differently  at any age     It would really be a good idea to sit your mother down and tell her that you think a doctor or therapist could help her to feel better about her possessions  and try to get her to see one  It can be tough with hoarders  because they're in one of the categories of disorders where they often don't think they have a problem  But she sounds like a really caring person  hoarding disorder sufferers often are  and if you made it clear to her that it would really mean a lot to you if she could try and learn some techniques to deal with her possessions differently    It's probably best not to frame it as an organization problem  one that just needs a forcible decluttering and a big investment in new storage units  because that's probably not the heart of the problem  Like  the problem is psychological  There will be some underlying reason why she feels the need to cut everything into little pieces before it goes and why to her  it feels scary and distressing to throw away an object  Her feelings are very real  so I guess even though I understand it's a pain in the ass  t least you know it's not something she's doing to you deliberately  you know   There's some info you might find handy on the HoardingUK site   http   hoardinguk org   Or the Help for Hoarders charity association  who can help you find support and therapy for your mother  plus it's got dedicated hoarding forums so you can talk to other people in your situation  so at least you won't feel too alone   http   www helpforhoarders co uk    The charity OCD  UK can also help you with hoarding problems  since it's such a closely related disorder to OCD  if those other two don't turn out useful  http   www ocduk org hoarding    I wish you all the best in getting your relative some help with this  Grit your teeth and hang in there  and see if you can convince her to get some support for this mental health difficulty  Hopefully she can feel better and not let clutter get in the way of her life again     
The ones I tried all bored me after a while  but I'll definitely give the ones you suggested a try   Maybe they're better   
This is weirdly similar to my 2017 goals  Thanks for sharing 
Honestly  despite having never tried medication  I have zero faith in it as far as healing my issues goes  and what you wrote above exemplifies one of the reasons why  The only advice I have for you is to get your emotions under control on your own  I have a tendency to lash out at others and regret it later too  I find meditating at least two times a day for 15  minutes useful because it helps you stay mindful of your state of being and your surroundings in the face of depression  Once you're mindful you can work on externalizing your issues in healthy ways when necessary  talking through negative emotions  if you want to find it necessary   instead if unhealthy ways like cathartically lashing out at people  Just want you to know I care and that this won't be easy 
i used to go  but my energy levels have been so low and fatigue so high that i cant think of it at the moment  i want to increase my activity levels    may b then one day  
I have a tic where my head will jerk in a random direction  Sometimes you can hear my neck pop  "Crack " I take medicine now and it's been significantly reduced  It was bothering me so much I just wanted to cry
whtever rings your bell   
You and me both  Every day is waiting to end into another day to try and make it through without sobbing in the corner telling yourself all the terrible dark thoughts no one deserves to think

I have been on Prozac  20 mg  for about three or four months and I feel a lot better  I still feel the depressed sometimes  but it's better than before  The only side effects I generally feel are dizziness or feeling faint  Every other possible side effect of Prozac has decreased since my body has become used to it 
good idea
Happy birthday  Prozac made me suicidal  it's not for everyone  Don't give up on meds if you have depression because they do work  I'd be dead without them  If you want to talk to a bored anonymous soul  I'm here lol

I don't think you're that dumb if you consistently use three periods to create thought breaks and do so in a seamless method  It's quite well written  Reminds of Mordin from Mass Effect 2   Maybe start embracing your traits instead of condemning them for not being the social norm  Go wild like Danny DeVito  He's pretty much what you described   
Can you get some help  It sounds like everything is out of control and you can't deal with it all on your own  Or maybe you can  but it'd be really fucking hard  Which is understandable 
If it's not easy to talk about it maybe bring a note explaining things  Maybe print off this post and show it to your doctor   
both my psychologists are on vacation because of holidays and it is a bit sucky tbh  also i got really self destructive and did some stupid things but i don't know how to fix it and i don't really care  i keep doing all these destructive things and i never tell anyone and it's dumb but it makes me feel like i have some control   and it's not anything they ask about in that way because it's not my self harm issues and it's not drugs so i don't even need to lie to not talk about it  and telling them or anyone else about it would make me feel so fucking pathetic and messed up and just like a fucking faker so nah   i don't know what to do about anything  i guess i'll just lie in my room doing nothing until school starts on monday and i see my therapist the wednesday after that  great

Sorry to say  texting is not for that kind of serious discourse  Reddit  Sure  Texting people  Not so much  Even being an understanding person with major issues  I'd easily get annoyed by that sort of text  Like someone else said  if you need to actually DISCUSS something with someone  just call them  Big part of the problem is that texting isn't used for that kind of communication for 80  of people  for myriad good  valid reasons 
I'm sorry you went through that  They're flawed humans just like the rest of us  I was on hold for 30 minutes once  I've had a similar "hung up" experience where I was invalidated and sent home from the ER when I was suicidal  It would be so nice if there actually were a reliable crisis system  Professionals act like the hotline or the ER are going to cure everything  but people are dumb and that's the moral of life  unfortunately 
I did  This was over a month ago and I've been long done with the antibiotics 
I have that too  I have had lots of experience with emotional abuse though 
At the moment  I'd be happy to be diagnosed as a green martian  if it got me setup on those three meds   Still not a bad idea to ask why if you're curious 
Ahhh  christ  That's got to really suck  I guess you're not able to be open about it  I mean  I'm not open with people around me unless I know them pretty well  but I heard of people getting kicked out  at least out of basic training  for stuff like that 
hell yeah  my exercise routine tens to be that small sometimes  but if its all i can manage I am fucking proud
Yeah  I am pretty much the same  I just don't care that much  My BF was super excited about my graduation and all I could muster was "yeah  I did it  It's not like it was hard or long "  that's what she said   A lot of my not caring is depression talking and I think the rest is just being mindful and in the present moment  I don't think too far ahead and just try to be as stoic as possible because attachment leads to suffering and I have a really hard time dealing with emotions  
A lot of people tend to self diagnose with depression which is very difficult to do  Really depression is a very complicated mental illness and there are so many types  Regardless if you are not happy where you are in life getting help will help you achieve your goals  This is a really good summary of the types of help available  http   blog tranqool com 2016 04 11 what are the different types of mental health service providers

That is fair  I agree that there are potential long term risks to really any meds  but especially anti psychotics of any type  The earlier you catch them  the less likely they are to be permanent  but the risks exist and it isn't fair to pretend that they don't   I would also agree that some side effects can make your quality of life so miserable that the benefit to mood or psych symptoms isn't worth it  The problem is  since side effects and benefit is so specific to each individual  it's impossible to know ahead of time what that balance will be for someone    I will be honest  In my case  the side effect profile of clozaril was not worth the benefit  I was taking it for bipolar disorder that literally does not respond to any medication that I have tried  My moods shift  while not frequently  they do and the depths of the depressions in particular become dangerous at times  The idea was the clozaril may prevent that  The side effects made my qualify of life suck which made me depressed anyway and it was another drug that didn't work    Since every drug I've tried either sends me to the ER  gets me admitted into the medical hospital due to horrific side effects  or simply does nothing  I really don't feel like I'm a good example of any experience with any drug   That being said  someone else who experiences symptoms of outright psychosis might have had the exact side effects I had and made the decision that they were worth the trade off  That person could decide that not having psychosis is better than the other things  For me depression was not enough  Especially depression that wasn't relenting anyway    It's all about where you are at  what things you value  what your personal tolerances are  etc   Some people can handle a lot of side effects if their mood levels out  Others want nothing to do with side effects at all and would rather be all over the place than have physical consequences of anything  It is a very personal decision   Edit  on mobile and trying to fix typos  Forgive the ones I missed

Your English is great  The grammar was good  a few run on sentences but that's hard to avoid    I truly believed I would be the same miserable I was at 14  Time  a lot of time  literally over a decade  has passed and things have improved  I'm not miserable anymore  I'm not super happy but I'm fairly content  Learning to let things and not involve yourself in other people problems 
It sounds like you are experiencing pretty bad PTSD from what happened   You're right  your parents shouldn't have handled it as a drinking issue  because it was clearly a rape    I think therapy is still the best way to handle PTSD   that's how I eventually was able to deal with mine   You can go to a therapist who has a specialization in sexual trauma  which I did after my first therapist was not really able to understand my situation   My second therapist was a woman  easier for me to trust since I had been attacked by a man  and secondly was a "women's issues and family" therapist  so she was familiar with eating disorders and sexual abuse  which was helpful to me   In terms of dealing with the PTSD  it might be that the other poster is right and you need some anxiety medication  but that would be for you and your therapist to figure out together   I personally also did a gentle  patient led therapy called  EMDR  https   en wikipedia org wiki Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing  which was eventually able to help me really cut out the nightmares and panic attacks

Like any other service  even suicide hotlines have employees who couldn't be arsed to do their job right  Please just come to reddit if you need help  it might take a little longer to get a response  but people here go through the same situations  and we can help each other out more than we think  One thing is clear OP   this is not on you   There's nothing wrong with you  you're definitely not beyond help  and you're worth more than you know

Hey  you are sixteen years old so do not worry that you do not have everything figured out  I would suggest giving college a try because college is not only a place to learn but a place to meet new people and discover new interests   And if you decide to change your major  so be it  I went to school with a girl who studied engineering with me for two years then switched to public relations and is really successful   So definitely try new things while you are studying and be open to new opportunities  And have fun  you're sixteen so you have your whole life ahead of you   Side note  most people throughout their teens and twenties thought they had it all figured out and I think that part of becoming an adult is realizing that no one really has 'everything' figured out because life is going to throw some curve balls at you 
There are many different types of journaling  many of which are   scientifically backed   beneficial  I've tried a few  and some stuck  Two of which I'll probably do for the rest of my life because I just feel so much better doing it   I don't generally write when I'm anxious  not that I really get that anxious anymore  Thankfully  But I'm still sticking with it anyway  The only time I journaled while anxious was when I was having intrusive thoughts  which have passed now  There it's very beneficial to write down what's going on in your mind at the time  and read them again when you're back to your "normal" self  And then you'll realize just how irrational and silly those thoughts actually are  I realized that myself while talking to a therapist  and then replicated that with journaling and it pretty much gave the same effect  Over time   also by not judging my thoughts  the intrusive thoughts went away   The two types of journaling I do are     Daily gratitude journaling  Every day  most days  at least  I'll write down 10 things I was greatful for during the day  Both big and small  It's been shown that by doing that you are physically training your brain to look for positive things in life  Pretty much the opposite of anxiety depression  which trains your brain to be more negative  I really love the science behind these things  since it takes it out of the touchy feely mumbo jumbo world      that's just what works for me     "Regular" journaling  If something bothers me during the week  or I find myself thinking a lot about something repeatedly  I will write down a quick note to remind myself to go in depth on it when I have the time   Then when I have an hour or so  I'll just start writing about that subject  and see where it leads me  I find it does the same as a therapist  You are bascially making connections you previously weren't aware of  and are bringing subconcious noise to the surface  Once you write untill you don't have anything to write about anymore on that subject  you can move on  and in my experience it will have cleared mental bandwidth  It seems to have to do with your brain not having the chance to really figure something out  because we all live in this fast paced world with so many distractions  That's not how we evolved  Now we have to make time for deep thought  and get it all out of our systems   It may not feel as productive in the moment because you are calm  but afterwards you might often feel a sense of relief and weight off your shoulders  Works for me  But again  there are many different types that may or may not work for everyone  Good luck 
Judging your obsessions as unique is actually a very common compulsion  There are people posting on here all of the time about the fear of having some disease or disorder  There's no difference between somebody that's engaging in compulsions for reassurance about schizophrenia  or autism  or HIV    This is why it's useful to keep the focus on compulsions and actions  You're reacting to uncertainty with compulsions  The superficial topic of the uncertainty is irrelevant  You could be worried about turning into a llama and it would still be the exact same problem  The way over it would also still be the same   Enjoy the normalness of these compulsions

I have depression and I sometimes use this sub to vent  However  even I sometimes find it to be too negative depressing  so I hardly ever post here  Doesn't mean it's a bad thing  it's just the nature of this sub  A place for people to vent is going to be full of negativity   If you don't find any problems with it  that's great  But don't act like this is some kind of echo chamber safe space where no form of criticism or disagreement is ever allowed  You're just feeding into the stream of negativity yourself 
Do you have a primary care doctor  What I did was I told my doctor I was feeling depressed  and they referred me to a psychiatrist   Birth control pills Have been linked to depression so that could be a factor  
Hey girl  fellow female HOCD sufferer here  Your story strikes me a lot because it's very  VERY similar to mine   I'm convinced that if you don't show signs of attraction to the same sex realy early on  like  around the time you start  getting crushes   chances are you're not really gay bi   I have a gay guy friend that when we were on high school told me he was bi  he said he always knew he liked guys and had several crushes on boys before highschool    nowadays he realizes he thought girls were pretty but what he felt deep inside he liked for real was guys   he was only using the 'bi' identification because he was very insecure about how people would take it he was gay  Much like an anchor to the 'straight' world    I also have a girl friend who was a lesbian in denial for the most part of her life because her family is homophobic as fuck  From a very early age she'd look up lesbian porn and be super aroused by it   even before highschool  What was interesting is not that she was homophobic towards lesbians   she actually always thought they were fine    she was always homophobic towards feminine men   Now  a second girl friend of mine that identifies as 'bi' told me she'd always thought girls were attractive from a very young age  She'd got crushes on girls more than she got on boys  Nowadays she's in a relationship with a guy  but she swears to god she's way more into girls   What I'm saying is that    Sexual orientation is something that comes with us from birth  If it was part of you that you were anything but straight  you wouldn't feel so anxious about it  If you were lesbian or bi in denial  you'd LOVE to crush on girls and feel super good about it  but wouldn't want anyone knowing that  The problem would be the outside world interefering with your inside world and not the other way around   Hope this helps  
Fastest relief would be AMPA activation   Ketamine  Agmatine  Sarcosine  or Psilocybin mushrooms

Hasn't it actually been proven that "positive thinking" or rather the forcing of oneself to do so has the opposite effect  
I don't know you personally so I can't really judge  but based on my own experiences it's often hard to notice change because it's so slow  For example  at some point I just realized I hadn't had any terrifying intrusive thoughts or panic attacks for a couple of months  And those were big  noticeable things  If I didn't even notice not experiencing those big things anymore  is it really a surprise I didn't notice the small changes either       I just look back at how I was more than a year ago  and there's no denying my life has changed dramatically  But I still think I feel like the same guy  but I clearly don't  In the same respect I still think I'm the same guy I was 18 years ago  I don't notice any change  But if I really think about it  33 year old me and 18 year old me are different dudes entirely  D  Perhaps you could reflect on that  It may be that you havn't benefited from it  and there are lot's of different anti anxiety techniques out there from meditation to journaling   journaling alone has many different ones with different focuses  But it also may be that like me  you just havn't noticed the change  Do you still feels as shitty have the same problems as you did the first time you visited a therapist 
Holy shit  I searched up "M 59 Fifty Grand   Scary All Over" and I absolutely love it  Do you have any more songs like that 
It took me a long time to get the courage to talk to my doctor  and then to actually make an appointment when I got a referral  I just told my doctor I thought I was depressed  They asked why and I explained what I was feeling and they gave me a referralto a psychiatrist   It was hard to open up but I just had to grin and bear it  If you have a friend or family member you trust and who knows what's going on  you could bring them along to the appointment if that might help

Honestly he genuinely thought he was connecting with me through it  I laughed politely along with the jokes  It wasn't til I talked to a friend support person about it that I realized it had made me shut down emotionally  I recounted it like an abuse victim  I know cause I am an abuse victim   underselling it and saying it was just kind of weird and I wasn't sure how I felt about it and only connecting with how it made me feel when my friend was raging about it and telling me to never go see him again   I had always heard that therapy was a place to open up so I made the effort  A critical point in my abuse story hinged on my parents breaking into a locked box in my bedroom while I was out of town and searching through my things  I was 21 at the time   They found out about some fairly innocent sexual interests habits  made an insane logical leap and accused me of being a predatory child molester  I was  and still am  an extremely vocal advocate for victims of child sex abuse and education prevention of CSA  a behavior my parents classified under the vast umbrella of me being "too sensitive"    This was only our second session but I was worried that if I withheld any information in this story that it might leave room for doubt in my version of events and make him think I was hiding the truth that I really did have pedophilic tendencies  So I told him in detail  the incredibly personal  private and totally harmless sexual interests that my parents learned about me   He agreed that my parents' accusations were ridiculous and manipulative  but he became fixated on these very personal things I'd told him  I had always assumed that it's part of being a therapist that even if you're completely shocked by something  you react calmly to it and explore it with your client neutrally  This guy did the exact opposite  He treated the things I had told him  things that are well known and studied in the field of psychology and shared by millions of people around the world  as if he had discovered a strange new form of mental deviation  He was fascinated and made sure the rest of the session revolved around this topic   He reacted like you might react to your best friend saying they were abducted by aliens who speak French  wear lederhosen and exclusively drive 2003 Dodge Durangos  wanting to engage and be supportive but dumbfounded by the ridiculousness of it and unable to keep from being patronizing while discussing it because you can't say "do the aliens choose 2003 Durangos for the features or did they just get a bunch of them randomly " while keeping a straight face  This was the tone of the conversation we had   He asked suppositional questions about it like I was a specimen to dissect  even when I repeatedly tried to change the subject  I felt like he wanted to publish some paper on me entitled "sexual freaks  they walk among us"  He kept making jokes about it  repeatedly stating he likes to use humor to approach awkward subjects  He did say there was nothing wrong with it  as he literally stifled laughter  with the implied air of "some people live in abandoned lighthouses  shampoo their hair with peanut butter and fall in love with paper clips  I'm not gonna tell you to stop being a fucking weirdo"   He connected the fact that I was a 24 year old virgin and hadn't been involved with anyone romantically since I was 16 not to my trauma from abuse  self hatred and crippling anxiety  but rather because I was stuck using my unconventional sexuality as a coping mechanism  and made jokes about how no woman would ever be interested in someone who does these sorts of things  Half jokingly  he advised me to never let anyone I might date know about them    He ended the session by saying that he looked forward to discussing this more  not my abuse trauma or my disastrous executive function or my paralyzing anxiety  but specifically this topic  stating this in a euphemistic way that cracked another joke about it   He said our goal moving forward would be to help me transition from these interests to an "actual girl"  The way he phrased it very strongly implied vaginal intercourse  despite the fact that he knew at the time I was practicing abstinence   Every mental health professional I've ever told this story has been horrified  My current therapist is near impossible to shock  and even she got visibly angry when I recounted it to her  It was one of the most violating experiences of my life  and I'm glad I wrote it out since it's really the first time I've gotten all my feelings and recollections of it out in one go 
I am a great believer in asking for forgiveness when you think you have wronged someone and making peace  But be prepared in case you get rejected or they are not willing to forgive you  But at the same time  it's been a while since you saw him her   sometimes it's best to leave sleeping dogs lie    Only you know the right answer for you  
Have you tried sleeping medicines  melatonin pills  or anxiety medication benzos 
Hang in there mate  hope things get better
If you're still friends it's completely acceptable to text him  Don't go overboard with a million texts but let him know you're feeling lost and down and want to talk to someone  
Thank you  I appreciate it  I will try to make the best of every situation and it will probably get better in the future 
I use to be addicted to painkillers as a teenager  I overdose a couple of times too  Didn't matter how many I took as I still woke up in the morning  If you feeling suicidal its better to get help and talk to someone  you only gonna make yourself sick with those pills   
Man  that sucks  Sounds like a really heavy semester with six classes 
Good for you  school isn't for everyone but it can be really hard to find your own path  Sometimes family doesn't really get it but these tips may help you tackle their questions  http   blog tranqool com 2016 12 20 questions at family dinner 
That sucks man  girl problems are the worst  These things fuck me up the most 
I had surgery for some abscessed teeth  lower front  that kept filling my chin with puss  The surgery was unpleasant but it fixed the problem and I'm fine now  Don't worry  Go get the diagnosis and treatment you need  
Faithfulhumanity really hit the nail on the head here  but all I can offer is that after 12 hours  if you haven't started showing symptoms  you've probably dodged the bullet  However  if you're certain it's going to happen  because this anxiety disorder doesn't give a living shit about logic  then the best you can do is prep to make yourself as comfortable as possible through the ordeal   Go to the store  get ginger ale  some fruit  canteloupe was the only thing I could keep down last time I had food poisoning  and some crackers  Maybe some pepto  but I feel like pepto's really never done shit for me during these instances  Ginger tea is good to have on hand  too  If you catch it  at least the ginger can fight the nausea  Ginger won't do a whole lot for the diarrhea  but let's be honest  we'd all rather have nonstop diarrhea for a few days than any instance of nausea v  whatsoever    You'll likely be okay now  no use dwelling on  "oh shit did I eat without washing my hands   did I touch my mouth   etc" because it's likely with all the chemicals you hand on hand at the time  you'll be okay  you probably sanitized everything before there was much chance of contamination  But prepping for the worst case scenario while you're still able bodied is about the only thing you can do in the case that you did get contaminated   But again  I don't think you have anything to worry about over twelve hours later  Noro sets in really quick as far as I recall  Also  it's worth noting that a LOT of people will literally only get diarrhea  it's more children  elderly  and compromised immune systems that get nausea and worse  If you haven't been sick in 12 years  you're probably in the "mildly immune to things that make everyone else throw up" category  for what it's worth   Also  a fun facttype B and AB blood groups are inherently immune to more gastrointestinal viruses than O and A types  So that's a thing    And again  also  it's more likely that the people who were on the bus had food poisoning from poor sanitary conditions and given they were living in such cramped spaces  they caught it from one another from the "mist" effect Faithfulhumanity mentioned re  fluids   You're likely alright  friend      But if anxiety says you're certainly doomed  then prep your emergency ginger stash and everything else that'll make the experience as smooth as possible 
Hi  I hope you are doing okay   I am sorry that driving makes you  anxious  after reading your post I can understand why you developed a very real and legitimate fear centered around  driving   You mentioned that your stuck hitching rides from her to get your kids to school  Can you call an Uber  Lyft  or  taxi  to get the kids to and from  school  I  could see this getting expensive   but look into the cost    Ubber  and Lyft can be cheap  If  it's too expensive maybe you can contact a charitable  local church and explain that you are without a car and sincerely need a ride  Even if you are not religious and dislike your local churches I could see them being a resource  Talk to your schools transportation and set it up to have your kids bused to and from school  Talk to a third party  like your kids pediatrician or another source and ask for resources which would provide you with safe ride options to And from school  Don't give up  I'm just trying to think about options which would free you from ever having to be in the car with her again  
ty for this
I think it's more common with anxiety and being self conscious    I don't really care what people are talking about  I don't even care if they are talking about me  My bf has anxiety problems and he thinks people are giving him the evil eye  talking about him  sizing him up  and becomes paranoid in crowds when alone 
I often get blurry eyes and double vision  especially late in the day  Been thoroughly checked out by eye doctor and neurologist and they couldn't find anything wrong with me  
Yeah and i was actually feeling really good that night aswell
Same  I have all the things a girl could need  except a car  but still just feel like doing nothing all day  
I'm like this also  except the friend I became too close to is also a sufferer of anxiety and depression  and self harms  It's gotten to the point yesterday where they blamed their cutting on me and said I drive them to be more depressed because of how I am and how I speak to them  I've been so close to this friend over the years and now I feel desolate that they don't want me anymore  Yet in my rational part of my brain I also know I shouldn't need this particular one person to be happy  It's a horrible situation 
Damn i never thought i'd see someone with a similar taste in music as me  I'm a big fan of teamSESH and Bones  Have you listened to SadlyThatsJustTheWayThingsAre   but sometimes they make me feel more sad tho  idk why   I absolutely love music and art  i have complete discographies from a lot of artists  both digitally  illegal of course lol or free stuff  and physically on vinyl  cd  etc     Can't get into Suicideboys  Pouya or stuff like that tho  i've tried but i just can't  In fact right now im listening to WhenTheTreesMeetTheFreeway by Bones  
On Prozac  and I think it's numbing me as well  not in a good way   It either could be my depression or Prozac that's causing this 
Take small steps  There's a sub I think it's r bodyweightfitness which can get you started  I think doing exercise helps
Thanks for the suggestion
If you had an abscess  it would probably be seeping  which you could definitely taste       Infections get pretty gnarly pretty fast  and you'd know it  inflammation  pain  seeping  foulness   To prevent an infection until your appointment  rinse your mouth after every meal with either salt water  diluted hydrogen peroxide  or something like Listerine 
Thank you for you comment  I really appreciate it  I do not have any grandparents  aunts  or uncles  And I would really prefer to keep my friends out of this   I do believe my father is seeking help  however I do not know how or from who   Your questions  A  I have not  and would not plan to  I think that this account is as public as my situation will get  atleast hopefully   B  my little sister does not sleep alone  she sleeps with my two older sisters 
I see a few things to look forward to   Finishing school and graduating  Becoming fluent in English  Your written portion is okay but could be improved  Completing summer exams  Finding a girlfriend    Life can be pretty dull when you don't know what to do with your time  It sure is for me  
Well  a clean EKG is a very good sign  However  it only records what is happening while it's recording  and it is possible to have intermittent arrhythmias which only occur occasionally  I e  Not when you're at the doctor's office   Luckily these are usually not dangerous  If your doctor has any reason to suspect a problem  they might give you a holter monitor to continuously record EKG for 24 hours    Fwiw  I often have an awareness of my heartbeat and it feels like it's doing weird things  I haven't done a Holter but I was thoroughly examined by a cardiologist who said don't worry about it    Also  if it's true vertigo  it's likely caused by vestibular stuff  and isn't really a big deal    ask your doctor if they'd recommend a vestibular evaluation    
Hey  I'm an uber driver too  It really is exactly as you described  I was nervous at first  but now i'm kind of addicted   I didn't drive for NYE though  I was at home helping a new pet settle in my home 
I think we have all gone through this  it's best to leave it in the past as you cannot change it  If there are any people still in your life from that past and you know you hurt them  it is worth asking them to forgive you  but otherwise just do your best to move on 
I hate sad dreams  Or those dreams where I'm late for work or school  They can ruin my day 
Prozac  60 mg daily  I still have plenty of depressive episodes 
The song is Fifty Grand  Scary all over   and that's a real rarity i dont really know of much similar but Fifty Grand is the artist so i'd recommend checking more of him out  it sounds like a girl because he was born a girl  but identifies as male now  P confusing stuff    m59 is the song by bones and drip 133    also a great song  cheers for checking it out  D i love sharing music especially when someone likes it   which is rare haha 
Yeah bones is just a god  I couldn't really get into  B but they slowly grew on me   but still more a SESH fan  Will give Sadlythats   a listen    kind of slept on Rotten 
only you know the answer  if those friends are bad friends so thats something you can know if you think about it  because maybe there is another reason they are your friends  like use you or hanging out with you because they dont have someone else  if you have at least 1 good friend  you can talk to him about that in a way that wont revreal entirely your problem 
Those are all fair things to want  Everyone is entitled to them  I'm in the same spot  I'm at a real low point  I know I have to go get whatever I want  It's a matter of drive  I can't motivate myself  I keep telling myself tomorrow is the day my life will change  Ugh idk    I'm just rambling  Good luck with everything man  Happy new year to you too 
Yep and yep  I don't know if it's depression or the medication that's doing it   
my eyes are really sensitive at night too  I think it's just a common thing  and I'll do things like dim my mirror to help manage with it  I also get eye strain if I haven't seen natural light enough in one day  weirdly enough   so I try to go look out a window every now and then  I think you'll be fine and you should trust the eye doctor  it's likely you're just worrying so much it is wearing you down 
because i am a loser
I don't know why  but I've been consistently feeling worse over the past few days  I've had a pretty bad first half of December  but right before christmas  I began feeling better  Then christmas came  basically my whole family collapsed into chaos and my mother threatened to kill herself   I got a mild flu  missed the only party I was ever personally invited to  had a fucking horrible new year's eve  still sick but tried to throw a small party  a girl I have a kinda complicated relationship with  she gives me the fault in her depression  and when I cut myself in December she just punched me and got mad at me  came by and got on my nerves  I was completely alone at midnight and realized the new year wasn't gonna be any better  On January 1st I woke up fine though  I felt really OK  But then it started  a gradual decrease  I don't know why  I don't know when it will stop  and most of all I don't even know why I'm posting this here  It just kinda feels like the thing to do now 
Woops  screwed up the name  haha  I'm going to look up more things by him 
Will it stick  Or do I have to keep this regimen up indefinitely   I was hoping for a fix  not relief
Not too much out of your way  it seems    
So do you think people  who dont know you at all are better judgement than your psychiatrist  i dont think so  see another psychiatrist to get second opinion or just accept what he is saying   it happens to met too when someone laugh or saying something bad and i think it's about me  i even remember particular stories that i found out it wasn't true and thats all in my mind  i don't have paranoia 
Yeah  I had a small class of  I don't remember  9  They all grouped together to smoke  buy lunches  and bitch about homework  It was awful  I don't smoke  can't afford take out food  and wanted to go to school and knew I would have homework  I just silently toiled away and kept to myself    It's okay to just want to be alone and chill  My family is inviting to all these events  they'll pay for me to go since I can't afford it  but I just don't want to go to a loud event with a bunch of people I don't know  They have a hard time accepting it but it's my life  It's your life  You can live it however you want as long as you're not hurting others    I think a lot of the 'happy people' don't have depression and just do what everybody else does because they're pressured to and it's easy for them to fake it

the problem is actually thinking I am worthy of success  Of thinking that i am actually good enough to succeed  
Happy and healthy new year all      My EOOD journey starts today   I've been lurking for a few months  And because of this sub  a few weeks ago I decided that if I am going to lay down on the couch and sleep or lay the day away  I at least have to go out and walk a mile  Thus far that has worked   most days I walk 2 4 miles  and so now I'm stepping it up and getting back to the gym  I  need  accountability  and I had great success before at Kosama  a class based gym  so I enrolled there again  5 6 days a week the first thing I'll do in the morning will be kicking my own ass  It is a well deserved ass kicking  I have put on weight  failed at maintaining a relationship  and am struggling to finish grad school  Instead of spiraling out of control  I'm spiraling into a rug of bleakness  So I'm taking a left turn and taking my life back   My number one goal is to find an equilibrium  My life has always been filled with extremely high highs followed by extremely low lows  Last spring and summer was the high high and fall was yet another low low  I fear that this momentum will lead to that  That's why I chose an early morning class time  the decision to get up and go do will not be an all day process where I come up with a reason not to go  it will be a decision I make and  hopefully  a routine I can get into  I chose to start the x effect card today too  I figured that this could be a good way to see the new normal and mark down my progress    I do have one question that I feel ridiculous for asking  but whatever    if I like the Facebook page  will people be able to see that I did    I've always just slipped away during my episodes and I really don't want people I know to know about my struggles  I want to do this on my own  for me  and maintain that anonymity  This is probably not healthy    but for now  I think it is what I want    Anyways  that's me  I'm here  struggling with the rest of this sub  for a better and more confident me  Cheers  edit  jumbled words 
This is so true
Yeah  I'm gonna bring it up to my doctor for sure then  The thing is that I started taking Prozac as soon as my depression started  so I don't know if it's worse than before
You say you give lessons to a group of people one thing you could try to do is focus and look more at the rest of the people not in an impolite way towards him obviously but try not to focus too much on him because it distracts you and makes your thoughts go crazy   Second of all try to not see him in a sexual romantic way just look at the dude like he's your friend or a normal random person on the street that you make short talk with   The fact that you're being attracted to him makes you have certain expectations of him in your head like being with him a kiss date anything  therefore causing you to be awkward and shy because you want to look good in his eyes Try to not stress it too much and see him as just "a guy" 
tell her it was the best day of your life  tell her you want to hang out more  dont be needy and annoying  constant unreplied messages ect  but just tell her how you feel   odds are she feels the same and maybe she thinks you don't like her because you didn't kiss her on that day or hug her or some shit   relationships are weird   you're very young don't stress lots of lessons to be learnt still    good luck buddy 
What I tell myself when I start freaking out about something is that yes  we're all going to die  and there's very little we can do to change the where and when  But  the little we can do is very important  and that is stay on top of our health and habits and create the best conditions possible for optimal survival   You are accomplishing this by getting your first pap  It is highly unlikely that you'll be a statistical outlier and 'win' the big C  indeed  most of us at your age are dealing with the fears of a sti   From here on out  stay current with your healthcare and you can be reassured that it's far less likely that you'll be one of those people caught entirely unaware by a major health issue   It's also important to realize that some of your response is you processing the trauma happening to your cousin  So  it's okay that you're crying and upset  It's still a form of grief  even though you have every reason to believe things will be okay for her  Best wishes  
you should report that person it's clearly not a job for them 
Thanks  I know seeking reassurance just kinda strenghtens my anxiety   it feels like it helps but in reality it doesn't  
and if she does say she doesn't feel the same way about you   don't let it hurt you   we have all been there   i had a girlfriend at your age who i absolutely loved to death but i was so shy and nervous around her even though she was my girlfriend that she dumped me  life goes on  P
Happy New Years Internet stranger  Hope life is slowly getting better for you and know that people out there care about you 
Yeah  and the legal culpability they'd face even would be horrendous   
Thanks for the advice  also it feels good knowing someone deals with the same type of thoughts  I try to dissociate myself from my thoughts  I know I am not these intrusive thoughts  but the images that come to my head  knowing I don't believe in them  is enough to sicken me  Sometimes it just makes me question myself and my morals entirely  y'know  
I thought of another good one you might like  Spooky Black   Without U   just don't let the video creep you out haha
Hmm  Idk how old you are  but if you're over 21  and live in the US  maybe try a little bit of Indica marijuana before sleep  There are some strains designed to help you sleep or be less anxious and or depressed  If you're of age and willing  try that  But make sure you do it with a sitter around the furst few times and don't do too much or too often  It can easily form into an addiction  especially if youre self medicating often  so watch out to not get hooked 
Huh  The years just aren't something I pay attention too  Pretty sure I just don't want to think about time progressing  
Yeah I've learned to kinda just let the thoughts come  don't push them away because it actually makes them stronger  Sometimes it works  sometimes the thoughts are so disgusting that I physically can't allow myself to just let them come and not try to push them away  
Haha I know I'm not a pedophile  but my thought is constantly "What if "  I always question my morals and myself  It's horrible
Respect  good on ya   im travelling currently on my own and i suffer from anxiety  can be tricky at times but glad i packed my bag  
thanks x2   from someone whos got a bad habit of just browsing "hot"
Do you think no one in your position never did the change and became happy with his life  not even one person  why couldn't it be you    Be positive  think good about yourself  by the way you are writing and what you are saying i can see you are smart  you also said to the readers to "forgive you if its hard to read" it means you are nice person and considerate  i bet you have more good qualities that people can appreciate  people made it out of rock bottom and you can do it too  read about positive thinking and other issues you think you might have and you will see the change  it may take time and it will be hard  but it worth it 
You're very thoughtful  thank you so much for taking the time to write this    it really helps  and it does make sense 
I try also to do that  but usually the thought is still there  cus deep down I still kinda focus on that thought  I guess I just need to calm down and not latch on  Thanks for the advice  
good stuff  i'm sure your boss will understand  mental health should be treated like physical health  you wouldn't go to work with a snapped leg  so why go with a broken mind    best of luck mate  may i ask   are you a heavy weed smoker  no assumptions just wondering  paranoia sucks ass  i can't leave my house without thinking my roommate best mate is fucking my girlfriend the minute i leave   even though i know they both have more respect for me than that
I agree  I've tried to die with carefully calculated doses  several times the lethal dose  of IV narcotics combined with hard alcohol and Benzos and I woke up both times in my own vomit  It's just so hard to shut the body down  
I've been thinking about doing that on the weekends  or nights where there is nothing going on   Seeing people being happy esppecially groups of young couples who have absolutely no inhibitions has always been a major trigger for ne   It always reminds me of something i never had over the course of 35 years and there they are  living it up in their 20s surrounded by friends   It sounds like a great opportunity to get comfortable around people   Better jump on it before automated cars replace drivers and the ship sails   
Am in exact same situation  My exams start on thursday and I don't  know what to do  
I'm not saying there's no such thing as talent  but even great guitarists admit that practice is the most important  Also  I know a guitar teacher who's been teaching for 20 years  and he said he never had anyone he couldn't teach  For some people it might take longer to get where they want but that doesn't mean they're gonna be worse musicians at the end  Also  maybe you need a different method  or a  new teacher    Don't give up on it 
Yeah that's OCD lol  You just have to remind yourself that it's your OCD talking  not you  And OCD tells  lies 
sertraline   i was on 50mg for 3 years and it seemed to help alot with anxiety  recently gone through some rough times and doctor upped my dose to 100mg  50mg is lowest possible dose   its been about 3 weeks and i still feel depressed  suicidal  but also numb   i can't cry anymore   crazy moodswings  lots of sitting in bed feeling sorry for myself 
I think you have every right to feel the way you do and you are not being over sensitive about this   Your grandmother needs to understand how uncomfortable brining him up is making you  She is allowed to feel how she feels about him but she needs to be aware of how this affects you when you are in her presence  Maybe she is downplaying the fact that a man she cared for could actually have hurt you so much  For a lot of people denial continues even after someone close to them was found guilty  I agree that maybe you should mention how you feel when she next brings him up   Stay strong x
Hello  I have been on Sertraline  Zoloft  for a little over a month  and it has not seemed to help  I feel that my panic attacks are happening more frequently and they are harder to control  Maybe this means Sertraline is not for me   Also  if anyone has any knowledge of this please help   About a year and a half ago  I ate an edible  medical  and it was about 50mg  I had a really bad high  over a day  and was convinced I was dying  Ever since then I have had really bad anxiety panic  Could that be what triggered it   I feel that I have PTSD from that experience  I know that sounds crazy  but every time I have gotten high since then it has not been a great experience because I start to panic like I did that one time  And just yesterday I was thinking about how I feel when I am really high  I hate it  and I had a panic attack while driving  Driving makes it so much worse  
Thank you 
Is that an everyday thing  I haven't had a problem with my vision at all  The doctor said my vision is fine  My eyes just ache all the time 
I also kicked out of highschool and didn't do anything special for few years  i was sitting all day infront of my computer until something happened and changed that  it doesn't really matter what what was that thing  but it was very very hard  its like i've been forced to face my fears and leave my comfort zone    you can find that thing too  dont waste time  choose a target and everyday you live  live for that target  lose weight  go to see a doctor about that sweating  my brother had something similar and he got a skin cream that eventually he didn't need anymore   read articles to self improve and above all   thank your mother or any other person that helped you in these hard times  you have no idea how happy it will make them  and how you will appreciate yourself   if you hit rock bottom  the only way is up

I didn't know what I was doing  Just being reckless really but I found out dying is a lot harder than in the movies  Your body just has a natural instinct to survive 
It has gotten worse since I've been worrying so much about it  If I was confident that what the doctor told me was going to help then I don't think I would be worried so much

Well  I've recently had some changes in my depression  and have a clearer view on how it cycles  so I might have some perspective    I used to always think  back when it was mostly depression  that the happiness would come again  About two weeks during the summer every second year  and it's three times I've had that cycle now  For the same amount of time that cycle last before that  I was slipping into depression  and didn't realize  After I realized that  I tried  I tried to get better  I got to the point where I can have happiness every so often  and even break out of my depression for said amount of time  Kind of like all those happy moments finally adding together to actual happiness   More recently  I've realized that I have kind of neglectful parents  and really need to get moved out to be happy  I'll be working towards that for a good while  I've started making friends  I hate that I thought that way about suffering to reach some happiness  Like I mean  I hate it with a physical revulsion  and anger laden on my tongue  This is because I've had happy moments and happiness actually occur together some recently  circa making friends  I've realized just how sad  how damn depressed  how much I've been missing out on  How much even that happiness that I fought so hard far was part of the 'shit show'  I hate that I'm not happy now  when I think about  How do I think this applies to your situation   I cross streets easier now  not waiting to the point of irritating drivers  because  well  because  Those shit shows don't seem worth it anymore  and I'm a bit lost  Happiness kind of makes other stuff taste like ash  hey  Here  though  is what I think  I think it may be temporary  That the more happiness we get  the more we'll be able to realize that wanting to kill ourselves or wanting to die really aren't too different  They're both the same sorry state  the same lack of care for life  And the more equipped we'll become to deal with these states  I mean  you need to be being more happy for a reason  right  Just keep doing that  Mostly try to enjoy it while ignoring the suicidal impulses  That's what works for me  it might work for you  I don't know  I'm just saying it's something to try  But sometimes  whatever it takes  get mad  get sorry for yourself  feel vindictive that you didn't get to be happy  before   Start looking at those shit shows and wanting to say 'cut'  Not because of what they're doing to you at the moment  worsening the depression  but because of what they've taken away  being happy   Eh  maybe not quiet some perspective as   a   perspective  Take with salt  Wait  wait  take with sugar  Easier to swallow bitter things that way 
Dude  26F  Okanagan  Roman Catholic family of 6  depressed since 10  went to small town private school until 13  moved to city public school 9 12  always moving  not much friends  introvert  cannabis club since 16  Is your family from Eastern Europe too  lol  we are plenty  if you leave the house you may find some    Hope and worry never stopped an avalanche  You have to be more proactive and find a new steering pump   Reach out to your family  take your mom to Stanley Park and ride bikes or just walk around  Call up your nieces and nephews to vent a bit about your roommates and then ask them how they are and let them vent to you    It was really hard for me to find a relationship  My method was to work really hard on myself so that I was the perfect partner for someone  Then I went out with friends and got excited about being social because my goal was to find someone special  After pursuing a guy  who just wanted to be friends  he introduced me to my current bf  It can happen  
Yesterday i was buying paint from a really friendly guy at the paint department and i was absolutely wigging out   The day before our conversation went so smoothly and it was just a pleasant interaction  But this time I felt so incredibly awkward and thought he must realize i'm retarded and i ended up ending up wallking away with my head down   I mean all i was doing was buying paint  imagine trying to approach a girl or make friends   Not knowing how we'll feel one day to the next really throws a wrench into forming relationships because we set expectations that we don't feel we can meet the next time we see the person     No matter how many people there are online thete is no replacement for human interactions or intimacy   Finding situations groups where we can participate that don't absolutely demand we be social with people around us are great   Bowling is a good one   Just do everything you can to go out of your way to move your jaw around actual people   At the end of the day the good bad news is nobody really cares   
Hey man i feel you i do have a lot of regrets about the past and high school as well but i try not to think about them too much because the past is the past and you can't change it that's the most important thing that you have to remember You know what i do Instead of focusing on the regrets i chose to remember and think about the positive stuff that i did and it does give me a small amount of joy   I say that you still have time to do the things that you didn't get to do in HS like sleepovers and having drinks with your friends As a uni freshman you're still young and still have those opportunities  I don't have any wild crazy funny stories from HS mostly because i had a very small group of friends and i would only see one of them outside HS frequently but we never did anything "extreme" except sleep overs and sharing retarded stories I didn't even go to prom but i'm not worries about that i can still go to the uni prom when i graduate   The most majority of people won't be interested in pursuing you in anything if you don't "put yourself out there" even if they like you at first hand it's some kind of a "vibe" that you send to them subconsciously that you're a more private person or wanting a deeper connection I get you Have the same issue  But i do consider that as long as you still have some friends that you trust it's all good You can have fun with a small amount of people you can have drinks with your mates you don't need a huge ass party that you might not even be sure that you'd enjoy afterall   My advice to you is this try focusing on improving yourself and better times will come Also i would recommend you ASMR search on youtube  might help you with the sleeping problem YT is full of useful videos to keep the bad thoughts away hell watch a funny video that will make you smile it does help i have done it myself When you get to bed remember the good things that you did leave the regrets out because there's no point really       Take care man 
Yesterday I woke up feeling OK  I thought  the new year might be good  But since then  I've fallen into the same pit I had just emerged from  maybe even deeper this time  I don't know what's going on  and how long it's gonna last  but I hate it  Now I'm still to much a coward to actually do anything to myself  but then again  that means I'll have to endure this for longer  Fuck 
I truly believe everything will be fine  It used to sound like it was an automatic thing that everything will be fine but I have changed my perspective  I see everything will be fine as 'no matter what  you wake up and can make different choices today'   I think it's more about the present moment will be fine because the present moment is literally everything we have  We have no past  we have no future  we have the present  As long as you're not in clear and present danger then everything will be fine

It was absolutely not your fault  you can dress however you like  The problem lies with them  100   You didn't do anything wrong  remember that  Please  speak to someone you trust  get tested on drugs they might have given you  and never forget  IT IS NOT YOUR FAULT 
Yea these are beautiful  I love all of them but the last one I made my desktop  Does she have more 
Yep I have it every day though not always all day and some days are worse than others    my eyes don't ache though  so I guess we don't have the same problem   p
This is a horrible feeling  "being sensitive"  It immediately invokes that flight or fight response and instead I well up with tears immediately    My ex was angry and emotionally loud and violent  He would get mad and lash out at thing  breaking them and slamming stuff  He would yell and I had no other response but to cry and stammer out something  It made him more mad  He didn't understand why I couldn't deal with it even if it wasn't directed towards me    Just like some of us are more introverted and quiet  some can't deal with those crazy  negative emotions running around wreaking havoc on us  I refuse to be with someone like that again  It was a scary time for both of us  I hope it gets better for you soon xo
Well  lung cancer is extremely unlikely because you're young and not a smoker     also  anxiety can cause feelings of trouble breathing  It's probably best to trust your doctor  though you can always see another doctor for a second opinion if you're not satisfied with the first  That will hopefully give you more reassurance than Dr  Google   p  You could insist on fancy scans of your lungs  but it is probably best to trust your doctor's judgment about whether that's necessary    just ask him her directly if they think it would be a good idea 
Did you get that person's name  Call them when you have time and demand that you talk to someone higher up like a manager   They should be able to see who was talking to you at the time you were calling them if they have your number   That employee should not be allowed to do that to more than one person 
We are atheist good choice    no deity cares enough to help us
Never just you  Have you spoken to your roommate about that happened  I usually try to diffuse the situation by ignoring it and never wanting to talk about it again  but it's bad conflict management  You can do it 
I've had social and general anxiety for about 10 years now  I got into a relationship I really believe is amazing  I'm really just done with anxiety ruining things  controlling my life  or causing me to detach from people  I wanted to get better for myself  my SO  and the future    It's never too late to start or start over  It's been 6 months  and I'm improving everyday   therapist classes etc 
How do you travel without being rich    Not being snarky btw  just wondering if you have some frugal travel tips 
Thanks for the reply   also does the symptoms I listed sound like bronchitis 
I disagree with this completely  As one of those "pretty ones" you mention who's also fighting depression I think it's pretty rude to generalize like that  No one falls over for me and I don't expect everyone to be enamored at my body  Being "pretty" does not force people like you  Being manipulative and controlling force's people to like you  
Am i ugly and gross then 
Is there contact information for admistration   Most have some way to provide feedback about your experience 
I'm gonna think about how to approach it and come back to you if I think of anything  but I really think it's something important to do  Guilt is a shitty feeling 
Thank you  You're completely right     There are no limits to what our own minds can do  I am just starting to realize that everything I think  I attract and I can choose to change path I walk    Keep sharing the amazing things you do  When you inspire one it tends to have a trickle effect  Thank you again      
It worked out  There was a big misunderstanding and even though I never brought it up to him  when I got home he apologized for blaming me and then we went to see Rogue One together  So things smoothed over  I really do hate confrontation though and will do everything to avoid it  
I just spend my time in the shower wishing I could be different thinking how fucked up my life is
One thing  Fuck those guys  I'm honestly casting shame on them  You don't take a serious job like that and be an asshole  Like seriously how the fuck could they allow a person like that to work there   There is nothing wrong with you  Its with those people you talked to  Seriously I feel bad for them that they must be having a bad day or grew up to be like that  You on thw other hand  have depression  a painful illness  And you have better manners than them   Something is wrong with them here  not you 
Not your fault  You're not a slut  They absolutely forced you and raped you  Holy hell  please go to the hospital  tell them you were raped  call your parents  call the police    You did nothing wrong  You were drunk and underage  They actually raped you  Please  I can't imagine how you're feeling right not but you have to tell your parents  you have to see a doctor    What they did was straight out of a true crimes show  You did nothing wrong  They are horrible people  never hang out with them again    OP  please  this is very common because rapist blame the victim  you  for what they did  They were in full control and probably planned it  You are at no fault  You are underage and could not have given consent and you were intoxicated

The US needs a much more effective mental health system   It shouldn't be a fight to access affordable services 
Guided meditation  YouTube  SoundCloud  Spotify  Google Music  etc have playlists specifically suited for you and your partner  
This reminds me of the classic Jim Carrey stand up routine where he does a skit commenting on this    "How are you  man "  "I'm all dead inside "  Fucking hilarious 
I'm too Depressed for exercise I can't go 1 minute doing it
I have no one I want to confide in because most people in my life have not gone through as much shit as I have  How do I know this  I play the role of 'counselor' among my friends  Maybe they haven't told me everything they've gone through but it doesn't matter coz at least they have me to turn to  I have no one  I'm deep in debt and my situation is not getting better at all

FYI  skipping more than one dose of lamictal can be dangerous  If your blood levels drop significantly and then you go back to the dose you'd been taking before they dropped then you risk the SJS rash  But at least you started taking it  Why haven't you been good about taking your meds  Do you think you don't need them  Are you in denial about your diagnosis or do you think they'll hurt you somehow  I want you to feel well 
If you called a national number  you could try looking for a different number on your county website  assuming you're in the US   Also  http   www nami org Find Support has the option of selecting where you live in the US and finding resources on their website  You're not alone  I've heard of the suicide hotline hanging up on people before  it has more to do with the receiver probably not having enough training and or not being very good at their job  
Nice   I love this quote  "before I began running the idea I'd ever go a mile seemed impossible   And of course it was  until I ran a mile "  Keep on going   Small steps are huge steps     
That's so sweet of you to care for your younger brother  If you can't be there physically you can be there electronically  Send emails  e cards  maybe start the same game app and play together  skype  send small packages  Try snail mail because it's fun to get things in the mail and the physical material is something he can have at home to look at 
Im down
Omg I've been getting the same thing  The past fewdays I stopped taking Xanax  1mg a day self medicating for a couple months  and when I lay down at night I feel exactly the way you described  I feel  waves of panic rushing through my heart whenever I reach that point where u start to fall asleep  All I know is I will never take Xanax again  Yea when you're on it  it works but  it's only been a couple months and I'm tired of sliding the problem under the rug    The withdrawal is what's making me never want to take them again  I never knew quitting benzos would be so detrimental to my health  It's already been almost 96 hours since I've last taken it  and people I should feel much better in a couple days  I just want to say I was near giving up because I couldn't sleep  shaking  cold hands  sweaty feet  no appetite all week  It's horrible but worth it  I know quitting benzos cold turkey isn't very smart  but I was only on it for a couple months and didn't take it everyday  So the withdrawal didn't start till after 2 days or so  Stay up and keep pushing  We're all in this together  
Are you sure its not my fault  One of the boys keeps trying to contact me for sex but says he will never date me because I'm not attractive enough and a gross slut
Don't let this one experience with them taint your whole outlook on the place  The one person I got back in 2010 cared a lot and stayed on the phone with me even though I wasn't all that kind and was frantic   Still  sorry you happened to get someone like that 
It's more dangerous to feel safe at home than to feel terrified around people 
Not the OP  but there's a surprising amount of things you can do with little money  Most state parks are either free or less than  5 for a car full of people  There's also tons of museums out there that operate on a donation basis  Every city has small hole in the wall restaurants and diners where good food is usually a plenty    As far as actually getting to these locations  that might be where you have little options  Gas for a car  bus fare  or a plane ticket isn't exactly cheap  But if you plan far enough ahead and know how much you have to save up  you can put aside a little money here and there  Good trips don't have to be far away either  I'm sure there are interesting places and cities within an hour of you  you just have to keep a look out  
All of my doctors  OB  MFM  pdoc  and a reproductive psychology specialist  warned me to have a plan  and that postpartum is hands down the most difficult and potentially dangerous time for a woman with bipolar disorder  They advised against breastfeeding both because of meds and because I need sleep to stay healthy  I had a LOT of help from family and my husband  6 months PP I have had only one moment that scared me  I was feeling like my husband wasn't pulling his weight  but he totally is  because I was so overwhelmed in that moment  I screamed at him with the baby right there  the baby wailed  and I instantly just crumbled into tears and sobbed for a couple hours  Other than feeling guilty and like a shit mom for bringing hostility around my little baby  I have been fine since  I am compliant with meds  I talk to my therapist regularly  and have immense family support  I think that "episode" would have happened bipolar or not  It's all about being proactive to stay healthy  being super aware of any slipping  and having people to help  My husband and I had an agreement that I had to be stable on meds for at least one year before trying to get pregnant  Being a new parent is tough  and tougher when you worry that you are a time bomb  but my child has completely changed my world and I will do whatever it takes to stay healthy and be the very best parent that I can  just like anyone else  
I was having stomach problems from anxiety  I have IBS  but I didn't know it at the time  I also got nauseas a lot  The gut issues lead to me developing further anxiety about the food I eat  and at one point I had anxiety attacks whenever I ate food at restaurants or even at home  The anxiety just made my IBS worse and it became a terrible cycle  Eventually I couldn't do it anymore and realised I needed help  I'm a lot better off with the food nowadays  but I still get anxiety every day or so from general things  like going on dates and some other social events  Thankfully I'm usually able to reduce it before it gets too bad 
Hi there and welcome to EOOD  glad you like it here   It sounds like you have a good plan for getting into exercise to me  I have always preferred working out first thing in the morning  I say to myself that if I can get up at 6am and go out in the cold  rain and dark to work out then the rest of the day is going to be ok   You dont have to like the facebook page or anything else if you don't want to  Personally I don't even have a facebook account 
They said they couldn't of raped me because Im not attractive enough and fat and gross
so true  everyone has their own chemistry and responds differently  it sucks that so much gets put on our shoulders when we are at our worst  Its like asking a prisoner to choose between isolation or suicide watch 
Are you able to stay in contact with him via skype   facebook or anything  My little sister is in the UK but skype keeps us close  and i message her on facebook every now and then to make sure things are ok   you certainly should not feel guilty for pursuing your career  and don't be ashamed to admit he is your best friend   that's fucking awesome and heartwarming

Thanks for your response  I am not looking for a sliver bullet  just something that can takes the pressure off  or makes the thoughts a little more intermittent   Did you end up ever finding a some what helpful medication    
Maybe a try lightening the load for this semester    Drop one class and pick up a hobby with friends   or volunteer at an animal shelter    Try switching to a fun class  like art  music  films  something low key that can help relieve stress and be something to look forward to   Maybe switch your schedule so that one day a week is u baratineur day  You get to sleep in  go out for brunch with a family member friend  go to a movie  window shop  walk in the park  whatever you feel like  
I've had the suicidal depressions for the last 15 years  Here's my 'stack' that FINALLY got rid of it   Morning  sarcosine  l theanine   caffeine  Vit D and 'Mood plus' supplement by Thorne research Evening  melatonin supplement before bed as needed Daily  10 15 min mindfulness and breath work  20 30 min physical activity that makes you sweat  20 30 min stretching  with focus on breath   Eat a whole food  plant based diet  Weekly  microdosing lsd  10 mcg  every 4 days or on 'bad days' Monthly yearly  100 300 mcg lsd or psilocybin every 2 3 months  Taking the pills is the easiest way to start  The real results come from the mindset you develop through mindfulness and diaphragm breathing  It's like re learning how to human 
sorry if i repeated the other reply i was writing it while there were no comments
Did you have a good experience on Prozac  
Well  that's not good  For your sake I hope it wasn't something like Tylenol because dying of liver failure is one of the most painful ways to die  In all honesty even swallowing a massive amount of pills is one of the least successful ways of taking ones life unless the person is knowledgeable about the cocktail they're taking   With that said  go puke and then contact poison control 
Understanding that starting a business could be high risk and deciding not to do it seems like a reasonable decision  It'd probably be more manic if you realized it could be a bad decision and impulsively dumped your entire savings into it anyways  
My friend   Please call 911   I know how hopeless life feels   I've been down the road of wanting to die   It can be so hard to hold on   But if we don't  all we will ever know is the crushing depression   We owe it to ourselves to keep trying   Please don't give up   
I guess I am confused on why you think you are bipolar II  Is it because of the experience with the franchise  That doesn't really sound like "grandiose" behavior    Even hypomanic goal setting type behavior for me has been taking the LSAT and deciding to move 2000 miles away to a Law School in a town I had never really been to because I thought mountains were cool  That was a hypomanic "grandiose" goal setting thing   I ended up going fully manic in the almost three months I was there and spent  30k on my credit cards  Then I left Law School    I am also Bipolar I though   I agree with the other person that said Lithium is far less damaging than mania  Mania can destroy you physically  I spent three months doing cocaine and sleeping with some people you wouldn't want to take home to your mother   emotionally and financially  It can ruin your relationships and cause you to behave in ways that are completely unlike any way you would behave if you were not manic  You can lose your job  your home and your family while manic  Not a good time  Trust me when I say the lithium is a far less scary monster when you are facing all of that   That being said  there are multiple mood stabilizers  and a bunch more that are used as mood stabilizers that are not specifically rated as such    If you are true to life bipolar  most studies  and most but not all  doctors would suggest that an antidepressant alone is a bad idea  Citalopram  Celexa  is an antidepressant  The reason for the monotherapy being considered a bad idea for bipolar folks is that it has been noted that antidepressants seem to precipitate mania or hypomania in much of that population if some kind of mood stabilizer is not also on board  Some people with bipolar disorder cannot handle antidepressants at all  Everyone's makeup is different though so everyone's doctor has to treat them as an individual   I suggest you discuss your concerns with your doctor  That person is going to be the best person to answer the question for you  From the limited information you gave  I am suspicious that you are not in the right ballpark but I am not a professional and no one should make ANY kind of diagnosis after a paragraph of information   You also should not put a whole lot of stock into much of what I have said since it is based off of the very little you wrote and I am not a professional  I just felt compelled to give you SOME kind of answer since I didn't want you to think no one cared  It's scary to be confused about what is going on  I've been there  I really hope you and your doctor come to some good answers for you   
Really proud of you man  I grew up in a similar situation  9 years apart here   My brother is too young to require much financial emotional assistance but I try my best to be as good of a brother as you are     like the other commenter has said I recommend keeping in touch as much as possible  Buy him a souvenir or something to mail over maybe  I know I would love to have an older sibling to keep in touch with even if only over the internet  
Reach out to him and talk about how you've been feeling  I know I clam up and push my bf away when I feel low  I am learning that it's okay to tell him I've been having a bad day  It helps a bit for me  
Thank you  it means a lot  Great idea by the way  I'll definitely do a video on how I got to this point    happy 2017 to you 
Fuck that  I'll take any saving or advice I can get 
I am 100  sure  I am 90  sure they planned this  
Thanks for your response  I guess I am just tired of obsessions coming out of no where and becoming life consuming  and I was hoping to start this process with the proper medication  Do you have any advice to combat hopelessness

It's definitely more true in some situations than others  With the internet  it's easier to be able to talk to people  Also it depends on the environment you're in when you're trying to talk with someone 
They raped you  It doesn't matter how attractive they think you are  or fat you are  or if you're gross  they drugged you  Alcohol is a drug  and forced you to perform sexual acts for them  then held you down   You are only 15  You are a child in the world  What they did was horrible and manipulative   Have you told your parents 
Our collective understanding of these conditions is lacking  and misdiagnosis is a thing  At 18  I attempted suicide  I didn't have any of the other symptoms I've experienced in depressive phases  I just thoughtfully evaluated the challenges I was facing  concluded it wasn't worth it  and methodically planned and executed an attempt  There's a long tradition of people committing suicide to escape shame and dishonor  e g  when outed for scandal or crimes  It's a very recent modern take that suicide is a slam dunk indicator of Major Depression  Anyway  I was diagnosed with MD   At 20  I had a manic episode that resulted in total insomnia  I was again diagnosed with MD  because insomnia can be a symptom  At 27  another manic episode with insomnia  Again  MD diagnosis   At 35 I had a manic episode with psychosis  and was finally diagnosed with Bipolar I  which I believe to be the best available diagnosis for me  and which I believe came 15 years late  despite my being entangled with the MH system for much of that time   At 37  I had another manic episode with psychosis  This time I was misdiagnosed with schizophrenia and put on irrelevant meds  As a result  I stayed totally manic for 3 months  and my life was 90  destroyed  I'm told that's really bad for you  Finally  a different doctor intervened and put me back on Lithium  and the mania stopped in a few days   Lithium isn't necessarily terrible  I never had any noticeable side effects from it  As I understand it  it isn't without risks  though   Anyway  I don't really know how one goes about getting the best diagnosis in this kind of system  Unfortunately  "getting the help you need" does not necessarily get you the help you need  But it might be the best you can do  just the same 
Sleeping w my legs wrapped around a pillow  hugging a stuffed animal and possibly listening to music w wireless ear buds is what helps me w this  Give it a try  Also have you heard of "Rescue Remedy"  Its a homeopathic solution to anxiety  You can buy it on Amazon  and it's very affordable     I take their gummy version at night and it helps me go to sleep  Just make sire you don't fall asleep w it in your mouth undissolved  I try to take it early enough for that not to happen  My favorite is the black current flavor     Most important thjng to remember is these feelings are just that   feelings   and while they may feel scary  they wont kill you     Hope one of these solutions helps you  Rest easier and feel better     
In my experience  the state didn't matter as long as I had a valid prescription and or refills owed to me   Your Michigan doctor might not be willing to keep prescribing for you without seeing you regularly though  so you might want to look into finding a new doctor in the location that you moved to     Look for a walk in psychiatric clinic near you if one is available and you need a new prescription on short notice   Wellbutrin isn't really considered a dangerous substance so they shouldn't give you much trouble on getting the same dosage 
I use this subreddit as a support group  kinda like an AA AlAnon meeting  I do a similar thing on r anxiety   The ability to express my concerns  fears  and hopes to a group of people who understand has helped me so much  People saying 'wow  i know exactly what you're talking about' makes me feel less alone   Seeing people recover gives me hope  Just talking to people that have the ability to comprehend what I feel like is freeing    I agree that its really frustrating when people who have never experienced anything like a mental illness try and shove their two cents in  Not only do they not understand  they straight up can't understand    They say stupid shit like "Go for a walk  That will fix you right up " or "you just need to get out and enjoy the world " Kay  
What   Even when I was a kid in the 80s 90s they emptied the room  It gave the janitor time to get it cleaned up and avoided a chain reaction from sympathetic pukers  Not to mention getting the kids away from the virus that is now definitely lying on nearby surfaces  
Nah  they just need to go outside  Fresh air is real antidepressant 
First thing to do is pick someone in your life looks like a family member for you  and open up to him her  Explain how you're feeling  how you want to escape  Emphasize you dont expect that person to magically cure you and make everything seem like rainbows and unicorns  Trust me when I say it's always better to open up and speak to someone than try and fix something like depression by yourself    Also go out and exercise  It helps  Just the act of exercising releases dopamine  Hit the gym 4 5 times a week  Plug in to your music and just run  do free weights or whatever  That's your "me" time nobody's gonna distract you and it gives you time to process shit  For me  things that bugged me or depressed me throughout the day week seem trivial when i work out  Almost like "why the hell did that bother me so much  it was literally nothing to be upset about concerned about"  It's the new year  people are gonna flock to the gym so you may have to wait or something for the equipment but i'd recommend just planning out a time of your day to go to the gym consistently starting now   You got this  It's all about trying and not giving up  
  
I go the other way  Eat until I am full and keep going  And then panic about the inevitable nausea  
A psychiatrist's job is to find a pill  to "fix" your problem   A psychologist delves much deeper and identifies unhealthy thoughts and behaviors which you have built up over many years   Your "paranoia" that people are laughing at you is most likely linked to some trauma or humiliation you experienced in early life   This has probably become a theme for you and the reason behind the trigger remains a mystery    A psychologist tries to find the memories and help you come to terms with them  a psychiatrist treats the symptoms with a pill   Sometimes we need both 
Tell him exactly what you said here  You're the patient  but you're the one who owns the treatment  and you pay him  He has an obligation to answer your questions  and address your concerns  It's best to be on the same page   If not  you've probably got a bad one and should change 
Bones is one of my favorites  But there is one person that holds me together  and I can relate with almost all of his lyrics  That's Bladee  his album Eversince is the best of the kind  You should hear the songs  Rip  Romeo  Lovenote  So what  Winter  
If there was vomit blocking the door I might have gone out the window  honestly  I get not reacting aa badly as we do but not caring at all  Wanting to stay in the same room as    it  Oh god  No  That even sounds inhuman to me 
Awesome    Can I have the dosages you used as well   Also would you say that Mindfulness and Psilocybin are the two most powerful drivers of this stack 
Can't take them forever  It's better if you can deal with it on your own   Takes effort though  
No Im ashamed
The only reason they gave to leave the room was that some people are sympathetic pukers  No one seems to have any damn germ awareness and I don't get how anyone would not want to prevent something as horrible as Norovirus 
That has happened to me before  I felt powerless to make any connection with them  or to survive the anxiety and awkwardness that would ensue if I told them they reminded me of when I was younger and I was in a very bad state emotionally and pretty much friendless 
Okay  I understand  May I ask why 
I went to the gym today  There's still something inspiring about the cheesiness of new year resolutions  Any recommendations on how to be disciplined about consistently going to the gym  My pops said I should get a workout partner  but I am not sure how to approach someone and ask 
The thing with rape is there is almost always some sort of judgement or assumption attached  Even you said that it is your wife's tragedy  Perhaps for her it wasn't  Perhaps it isn't some dark  terrible secret that has been eating her up inside for nearly three decades  It could be  I obviously don't know your wife  but maybe it's not like that    What I'm saying is  I completely understand why someone would choose to keep being raped a secret even if the experience wasn't earth shattering for them  People tend to make a lot of judgments and assumptions about you if they know you're been raped  People you have known for years  Some people like to pin everything you say or do that is a little out of the ordinary back on being raped  Being a rape victim becomes your identity instead of something you experienced  or re experienced and re experienced and re experienced   It becomes all people see  Not saying you'd be that way towards your wife  but maybe others did treat her that way in the past so she chose not to mention it  Or maybe it didn't effect her in a big way so it wasn't even worth mentioning  Everyone's different   
 I do my best so everyone is happy my feelings or desires are irrelevant    That's very demotivating  It's no wonder you don't feel like doing the oral report    Is it our choice if we live and work to live   Yes  We make all the choices in our life  even the choice to give in to societal pressures    Your existential crisis is what everybody experiences  Life can be inherently meaningless    A thought   All the drink  eat  party  and play games are available to you because of literally millions of people working to live  You are actually relying on millions of people getting up and going to work so you have the chance to eat  drink  and be merry with friends  You have relied your entire life on your parents going to work to live so you could go to university    Even when you decide to drop the university course  which is up to you in the end  you are still going to rely on millions of people to do what people have done for thousands of years  work to live   If you want to break free I suggest the middle path  It's the Buddhist way of life  I've always wanted to become a nun but I choose to accept the secular life  I still read and follow the middle path the best I can    I recently heard a great talk by the Western Australian Buddhist Society  In it was a story about the way we are help down in life  We can walk the path in life and we carry things with us  the past  the future  worry  depression  obligations  If we just learn to put these things they won't weigh us down  Take for example the university course  pick up a textbook  is it heavy  Probably  Now put it down  It is heavy  Not anymore    I have felt trapped and shacked in my life by friends  family  work  obligations  I have found the key inside myself and I hope you can too  Always remember that we have choices    
I've had extremely similar experiences  I have found that I can "egg it on" and reach higher states of mania by indulging the thoughts and playing into it  I can also dial it down by being disciplined about being skeptical  This isn't fool proof  obviously  One can be sucked into delusion unawares 
I've spent everyday birthday either alone or working since I was 20 I'm 28 now 
seen his name on a few yung lean tracks   will check him out cheers
I'm with u unifutomaki  hugs
Try to relax and think about this for a minute   You are not worthless     Your thoughts are controlling you   You are in control of your thoughts   Whatever you think about most you become   Research things like the power of positive thinking   You have proved to yourself that if you keep telling yourself that you are worthless you will continue to feel worse   Guess what     It works the same way  same amount of effort to convince yourself that you kick ass   Meaning with positive thoughts you can become unstoppable   Trust me I have my struggles  but you have to focus on your thinking   It's ultimately putting you in the place you are at 
Yep been there  It was only after the fact  weeks after  that I realised what it was 
Im so sorry you feel this way  If you need someone to talk to feel free to pm me  I also have no friends  so I understand  Once I get into public housing Ill probably never see a human except when I go to the store and doctors visits    You say youre strapped on cash  Are you in income based housing  Do you get food stamps    Im sorry to hear you have a family that doesnt care  Do they visit you at all  Have you tried telling them how you feel  
  Thank you for you comment  I really appreciate it   You're welcome   Thanks for the feedback     I believe my mother has reported this to some close  but distant relatives who are trying to help my mother   It's probably legal to move in with them too   In fact  with any relatives   Or any friends   For all your legal questions  you may be able to contact your state's Children's Lawyer or your state's Public Guardian   They may be able to help you for free   Or there's  r legaladvice     I would really prefer to keep my friends out of this   You might be able to sleep over for one night a week without telling them why   Though they might try to pry more information out of you     my little sister does not sleep alone  she sleeps with my two older sisters   Good    Edit   For information on young people's safety in general  see the book  Protecting the Gift  Keeping Children and Teenagers Safe  by Gavin de Becker   Especially do read the parts about sexual abuse   Your local public library system probably has a copy of the book   Good book   Recommended   For in depth information on child molestation  see other books   I don't know which      If my father were to be imprisoned  or die  I know for a fact that my mother would not be able to support our family on her income  which makes me sick to my stomach and nervous for the future   A   Do you still believe this is true   B   Is there a welfare system in your state or country  which gives a small amount of monthly cash to those who need it   C  How much risk is there that your dad could  Heaven forbid  ever molest your sister again 
I didn't know it was defined exactly like that  However  "They are compulsions  nonetheless  which is why the term Pure O is somewhat imprecise" and "commonly referred to as Pure O by the OCD community" lead me to continue just calling it OCD  Pure O isn't a clinical term 
Ignoring emotions is a coping mechanism I use a lot  It's left me pretty dulled  It also left me unable to deal with emotions  But it is a good idea to not get close to anyone that fast  That's healthy  
 D The little puffin  This is wonderful 
I am so proud of you  Look at you go 
Why put more energy into something  hoping to have a different outcome 
Hi   I'm so sorry that you're hurting   Depression is exhausting and lonely   and I know how hard it is to break free of it   If you want a new low effort friend to vent to   please feel free to message me   Sometimes it's nice to just have someone to talk to   
Awesome  I'm feeling the worst I've felt in years  I can't think straight  Any info shared is very important to me  Thank you very much 
Also find yourself a hobby you'd be amazed at the wonders it can do  Especially when you see the progress you've done  
Whatever you have that is overdue can truly wait   Your health and wellbeing is the first and foremost that you should focus on and everything is secondary   If anyone says otherwise  they are selfish and do not genuinely care about your well being   Feel free to send me a pm if you ever need someone to talk to   I love you man  3 and hope 2017 is the start of something great for you 
I understand  but what if the outcome is different 
I know how shame feels  I have been ashamed of myself for a long time but I am learning to forgive myself    Please tell your parents  Write them out a note  You need their support right now    If it's too hard  go to a doctor first    Are there walk in clinic nearby    Do you have a family doctor    Is the hospital accessible    Do you feel comfortable just calling 911 and talking on the phone 
I think you're making a good start posting stuff on here    It really sucks that your insurance can't help you more  It sounds like you've had a hard time for a long time  Maybe try and find a support group near you  and I would suggest talking to your general practitioner about getting on an antidepressant    The support group would give you people to vent to that aren't your fiancé  As much as he loves you  he doesn't sound like he's very good at being a shoulder to lean on  Its a skill that takes a lot of time to learn  and some people just are too sensitive to do it  They make your pain their own  and it just doesn't work for either of you  Especially because you're so close    He wants you to be happy  and it sounds like hes doing his best but this isn't something that he can fix and I feel like hes struggling with that  If you can find other people to talk to  it wil help you both  
That's a feature  not a bug  If you want help  that's what r gettingoverit is for  r depression is not meant to be a recovery centric sub  
I've been on latuda for three months now   and it has changed my life   It's not a cure   but it evens me out and I feel like a normal human is supposed to   I think   No more intrusive suicidal thoughts   and normal  proportional emotional responses to everyday stuff   
YW  OC  
Oh yeah man I hear ya  I have no desire to talk to anyone anymore  The ones in which I do are friends I've had since high school amd before my depression  I'm lucky in that they're amazing people  but I do know that one day we may fade away  and if not I'm lucky   However  they say to be successful is more about networking than anything  Well I ain't doing that for shit and I definitely ain't finding romantic partners   So I only hope that despite how I do experience loneliness time to time  that I will get used to it or something  That or actually have a desire to meet people 
I'm in similar shoes to you  Most of my friends always come to me for advice and it's been this way for a pretty long time  so I really have nobody I can openly speak to about all my problems comfortably  If you wanna talk  you're welcome to pm me
Noted  Thanks
Why would they do something so horrible
For l theanine and sarcosine I follow the pack instructions and adjust for body weight  so usually a bit lower  the other stuff is pre dosed  Micro dosing lsd  mindfulness has given me the biggest benefit  It helps erase negative behavioural thinking patterns  while helping me train to be calm and develop 'grit'  The first 3 months are the hardest  after that your mind and body stop fighting you and fall into the new behaviour patterns you've set up  The microdosing makes it easier to set up those new behaviours  you feel child like joy and wonder at everything and life seems shinier and easier to deal with 
Okay  I understand  Do you know the approximate time that you'll be able to afford help  And okay  I think that making the log will be a good idea  to determine when you feel the most down 
What do you do when you travel alone   I just got divorced earlier last year   One thing I enjoyed was traveling with someone else   How can I really make the most of traveling by myself 
I am actually wanting to do this  I didn't realize I wanted to do this  but now I want to do it  Esp  with the teeth  They need work 
Great job man  I'm too lazy to exercise but working with my dad gets me doing it  You have my admiration for getting it done 
People who have been raped are not somehow broken or incapable of building maintaining successful romantic relationships with others  Granted  many people need time to heal and some develop PTSD  but a loving relationship can weather it all if both parties are willing to do the work    I've only ever been in a relationship after being raped since the first time I was raped I was 15  I once was raped while I was in a relationship and I did break up that relationship off  But my subsequent relationship has been successful  I would like to think that being raped hasn't made me faulty somehow when it comes to maintaining a relationship  
Most people here only care about their own problems 
You need to realize  you'll make more mistakes by worrying and fearing  Mistakes are normal and even you mentioned people before you have done it  Just keep doing your project without worrying and double check whatever you're doing  
I'm not worried about the surgery  it's the 23 day wait and the location that bothers me
Horrible thing happened to you but you did nothing wrong   Please  tell your parents   or if for some reasons you can't don't want to talk with your parents  talk to someone you trust   about what happened  You should also contact police and you absolutely have to see a doctor   Remember  it wasn't your fault  
We all felt deeply concerned about the way the person hotline handled the situation  To the op  you are not worthless and will never be  Do not let the emotions control you  If ever you need someone to talk to  pm me  I'll be there 
Thank you  It's getting a little easier  My mood has been improving and I have found that my "voice" is fading with it  Perhaps it's for the best     St  Valentine was a martyr  You were not alone in your suffering  His skull is displayed with a crown of roses in Rome  Beauty always adorns tragedy  
You can forgive them  but still enforce the fact that you never want to see or interact with them again   Forgiveness can be for you and not them  Holding anger inside has never helped me  I've always found it easier to let things go  and stop letting it hurt me    If you don't want to forgive them  then don't  You have that right  And  you can let it go without saying you forgive them  You shouldn't hold a grudge or let that hurt tear you up inside  but that doesn't mean you need to say you wish them happiness and a good life  
Thanks for sharing
I guess if all the strangers you meet are mean  
The more you worry the more you're going to stress yourself out  Mistakes will happen  You are not a robot  We are human beings  Simple  Just breathe  
Yes I've had this before on Wellbutrin butttttt that was after taking 2 grams of it 
Yes  certainly a mis labelling  Make sure he  and the rest of your professional support group  understands that what you're experiencing are vivid intrusive thoughts  Try to monitor how often they happen and if there's any triggers 
So true 
Two things may need to happen  I need some energy to try again  I may need to let things deteriorate more so I feel like I'm making progress
lmao i'm on 300mg  150mg twice a day  so like uh what does this mean for me
Okay  I understand  How do you feel about retrying therapy 
Even if you weren't scared of it  why would you want to risk getting sick or smell it  The whole thing just makes my skin crawl  
Okay  I understand  Do you foresee that happening 
Could be sensitive to it  I do know the hallucinations you are talking about tho  so you aren't crazy
They don't necessarily kick you out but a stigma is placed on you for the rest of your career  It's what I'm going through now  every three to four years I have to tell my "story" all over again and placed back into the "behavioral health" program    That alone deepens my depression  
Well the tooth directly below my concerned tooth is actually abscessed and is also being treated during this visit  I do occasionally get the bitter taste from that one  If the tooth I wrote about in the thread post is abscessed  I'm not getting the bitter taste from it but it is slightly inflamed  as I mentioned  it's only noticeable physically  and tender  resulting in pain if touched  So I don't know if it is abscessed or the way it is because of its condition   Waiting 23 days is bothering me  I chose a bad time of the year to deal with this 
You realise they're just trying to help  they don't understand and that's correct  but they want to help anyway  You could always try to correct them on why you feel the way you do and help them understand or just complain that normal people don't "get" you 
I have the Mirena  Like it much better than the non hormonal copper Paragard  I don't think my moods fluctuate with my periods  In general I have found hormonal birth control to make that better   but am not sure if that's usually associated with combination birth control  
Okay  I understand  the same things have happened to me  How do you feel about them not believing you 
Skip your next dose and call your doctor as soon as you're able
What even is friendship  How do you do it  Where is the line between being friends with someone and just talking on a forum    Besides that  I just can't understand people and they can't understand me 
That definitely sounds like a tough situation with balancing family and what happened  This might be semantics  but I just want to start off by saying that I don't think you have to rationalize what happened  Rationalizing means justifying what your cousin did  which I don't think you have to do  He touched you in ways that you did not want  not consensual  and performed sex acts in front of you that he should not have  either awake or asleep   Your healing is what is important  not anything to do with your cousin   I think that it's great that you opened up about what happened on a forum like this  That is definitely not an easy thing to do  especially with your feelings about not sharing what happened with people close to you   To answer your question  sorry about my digression   No one can tell you how bothered you should be about what happened but YOU  He did something wrong and if that bothers you a lot that is completely fine and if it doesn't at all that is also fine  Only you can decide how "wrong" it really was  If you are thinking more legally  then check out https   www rainn org articles legal role consent to see how to actually define what he did    Finally  I know you don't want to tell friends or family about what happened because you don't want to escalate the situation  but from my experience  as a certified sexual assault and domestic violence counselor   it helps a lot to open up to someone who you trust  Ultimately  friends and family care about you and your wellbeing and want to help you if you need it  It sounds like you're having a tough time thinking about what happened and talking to someone close to you may help you understand it a little better    Sorry that was a long response  Feel free to message me if you want to talk about this 
Gross  I don't care if they haven't hurt anyone yet  the fact that they have those thoughts is bad enough  I'll never "accept" them 
I can be petty  so if I were you I would message them saying something like "jk fuck you" and then block them  I'm not saying that its a good idea though    You can also take it back  even if you never speak to them again  Forgiveness is a feeling  You can forgive someone without telling an soul  and you can take it back in the same way  
  est so everyone is happy my feelings or desires are irrelevant   Well if people cared about how i felt i would have a choice to die or work where i want   I want to break free but im happy to contribute but im sick of being treated like a cog
Well there's only one thing for us to work on  get better at meeting with strangers 
Tfw I'm one of those loners types but no one ever talks nicely to me
Peer support groups  particularly DBSA  Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance   Also NAMI  
Is there a sub for people who want to help people with depression  I've tried a lot to help some of the people who are here  even if it's just being there to listen  but I've only had one person really want to talk to me    Helping others makes my depression ease off a bit and I'm always open for making new friends  people with depression tend to be extremely kind as well 
I have these thoughts as well  I am damaged and I was born bruised 
I met some girl online too which I'm over but sometimes still think of her she was my first but I hope maybe 2017 changes my view of staying single to maybe putting myself out there just make things better letting my heart heal
When I was younger I used to deal with anxiety by either being the quietest person in the room  or going in the exact opposite direction and acting incredibly hyper  I gained a bit of a reputation for being "random" but people seemed to appreciate it and would often join me in my hyperness  In my case I was faking it like 80  of the time but I think my fake hyperness legitimately made other people hyper  lol  In their case I think me acting that way gave them "permission" to act weird in a judgement free zone  This was in my early teens and pre teens when I actually socialized a substantial amount 
That's a very difficult question to answer  There can be many factors and it's complicated   The best I can come up with is that they're selfish  inconsiderate  have twisted views on women  are too immature to date women  and they saw someone weak and decided to have fun an exploit them    Sometimes men do horrible things just because they think they can get away with it   If you don't do anything they will do this again    You shouldn't feel ashamed  They are the ones who should be ashamed    I understand that you didn't make good choices but that doesn't mean you deserved what happened to you  They did this because they're immature and horny and couldn't get a women their age to have consensual sex with so they preyed on a girl who is just learning about sex and relationships     Please call 911 and tell them you were raped on  the day it happened  by  the mens' names  and you're ashamed and don't know that to do    You are innocent in this tragedy  You're 15 and were sexually assaulted by men while intoxicated 
I totally understand where you are coming from  A little under a year ago I was a server at a diner  I ended up having to quit because the angry people and the understaffed restaurant made my depression anxiety so bad I thought about killing myself  Now I'm a teller still struggling with these issues  We just had to fill out our annual review and I basically was completely honest and talked about how upset members crank on my anxiety and depression  Anger frightens me to the core  even if the person is not directing it at me  That's when you get when your mom has a line of boyfriends that are abusive try to kill her basically  
Once  I called a nurse at the mental health place because that's where they wanted me to call if I had an issue with meds  and she said she was busy and I said something like "well  then I guess you don't give a fuck  huh " and she CALLED THE COPS on me  and they took me to the hospital because the nurse said I was trying to kill myself   I just needed to figure out something about my medication and they blew me off or whatever and to avoid any problems they just made me out to be a crazy person or some shit  A lot of mental health people are dicks and they get away with it because people think we're just delusional or whatever   Anyways  just let it go and maybe try again later if you can or call another number since there are a lot out there  Or I'm sure you can chat with someone here if you have to but you don't have to put up with being treated like shit 
Sure

Cheated on tests in 2016 which 2017 will not include because if I fail I fail my morality doesn't need to take so many blows as it has already
Hello  I'm a teacher  and I'm dealing with an issue that's cropped up for me before  I get very anxious and panicky when I have to go back to school after a long break  I had a panic attack at work  not in front of students  right after Thanksgiving  and my nerves are feeling a little fiery now that I have to go back tomorrow   My goal is to call my doctor tomorrow for a meds renewal appt  and to call a counseling center and do that again  Any advice for making sure I actually achieve those goals tomorrow 
The fact is is that normalization of this socially is reprehensible 
Honestly  exercise makes me feel worse
I want to try and get better at driving so someday I might drive for real I'll practice that on GTA  and someday get a good looking car I'll enjoy
Okay  I understand  Is there anything else you'd like to talk about 
What about Psilocybin  I thought that was the new miracle depression drug that they're hyping up nowadays
And I tried to kill myself by stabbing myself but my friend stopped me and now I'll be getting therapy pills   
Yeah  I can relate  Most of the time I'm torn between 'Don't be so quiet  you idiot' and 'Shut up  you're just being awkward    Ends up being a weird combination of silence and nonsensical outbursts most of the time  
I'm not here to explain my mental health to someone who is just 'trying to help'  I'm here to share my experiences with people who understand    People who have never had cancer  or even a close family member friend with it  shouldn't butt in at a cancer support group discussion  
I don't think you're dead because not sure the dead could post something online   but I think writing out how you're feeling might help  like in a journal or possibly make it into a novel some day  Maybe see if there is a cheaper option of some form of different therapy  I'd also suggest picking up some form of exercise and push yourself a bit harder than you know you are capable and it will release serotonin  the happy hormone  Also orgasms can help release serotonin  Message me if you need to talk  I've dealt with depression for most of my life
I shower everyday for a whole hour it's relaxing from my stress and anxiety lets me think and cry it's a safe place for me
I hope you are ok  Have you reported this  You should because my biggest regret is not telling anyone about what happened to me   I now realise I'm lucky as I watch my rapist die in front me  but death is to easy for them 
Yeah I tried once felt worse about myself
What does being treated like a cog entail  Do you feel underappreciated 
I'm here  if you need someone
Welcome to the club  minus meds  therapy  and forgetfulness  What to do once you lose feeling  Try whatever it is you haven't yet  if you still care to  otherwise the only thing to do is just float and wait 
I've only openly called myself depressed to my ex girlfriend  who I still have an intense amount of feelings for unfortunately  I tried telling one of my other friends but she didn't seem like she was really gonna be able to help  so I dropped the conversation   Do you have anyone to talk to at all 
Paranoia is different to social anxiety for me  let me try to explain  Paranoia makes me feel like constantly looking over my shoulder  like there is a lingering thought that something someone is behind me and I cannot rest until I turn around to confirm my suspicions  some OCD tendencies present in this  there doesn't have to be any physical reason for me turn around  just a thought that manifests itself uncontrollably  also warps my mind by turning completely innocent spoken words by others into some kind of attack upon me or that they are out to get me or cause me upset or annoyance    with anxiety  I am not afraid to turn around  I am afraid I will turn around and other people will judge me negatively for it  hence while solitary I find no such judgement and anxiety is greatly diminished   so much so I have convinced myself of this that when I go out I automatically feel judged before anyone has even cast a glimpse in my direction  paranoia is easily defined in my mind  where social anxiety is multifaceted  it doesn't just come from one cause it comes from a plethora  negative thought patterns  self consciousness  low self esteem  negative reinforcement  ect   which all feed into each other    OCD  anxiety  paranoia  depression  to me seems like they are all interconnected in some way  having experienced them  and gain momentum from one another  a part of the invisible tribulations of the human condition 
It sounds like you've got an exposed nerve or thin enamel resulting in sensitivity  As I suggested  keep it rinsed and clean  take your zpack  and monitor for infection  You'll likely be fine until your appointment  You're certainly not going to drop dead or anything 
Therapist accusing me that I have too high expectations     For me friendship isn't a one way street  If I constantly have to bug someone and put effort into it or it would fall apart on the spot then it isn't a friendship   If I'd disappear now and no one would notice  for months  it isn't a friendship  If nothing ever comes back from the other side it isn't a friendship   I think finding friends online is possible  Yet it's difficult and both have to maintain it  I had discussions with people online that were more meaningful than anything I had irl in years  Talked to people I could relate more to than anyone I met face to face    Yet real life friendships of course have a large number of other advantages 
 I am glad you didn't go through with your plan  I undertsand that it may not seem like it now but life can be worth living if only for small moments and little things that we encounter randomly during the course of living    I don't know what your situations are or what you are going through but when I was at your place I would often feel frustrated and had internalised a lot of anger  guilt and fear    I remember waking and feeling a vast emptiness within me as if an endless pit has opened up and it would suck all my feelings away  I remember feeling like my head was being torn apart by various thoughts that went in every direction  I would often feel frustrated and make mistakes than blame myself for making those mistakes and the cycle would go on and every issue will weigh like a mountain upon me    Therefore may I ask you why were you planning to kill yourself  I may not be able to do much but i can listen to you  And expressing your anxiety helps  It is better for you to speak write them than act them out    I hope you find your way and have a happier year   
Nice  I can only muster a few modified push ups  Good job 
I wish I could just drop out too 
Sexual abuse can absolutely lead to relationship issues and sexual dysfunction  This can be a somewhat complex issue  so I suggest you go to malesurvivor org or at least a consultation with a therapist or psychologist    I could give advice all day  but it looks like you are mainly looking for answers and support  Yes  while I don't know the details or your specific relationship  it is completely natural to have the issues you talk about years after experiencing sexual abuse  especially with men   I work on a sexual assault hotline  and I have talked to men who have had issues arise long after their abuse has ended  It is completely normal  and I'm really glad you had the courage to share this    If you want to talk more about this  don't hesitate to message me    EDIT  I realize that I forgot to answer whether what happened to you was sexual assault or not  The best answer I can give is that in some states it is and some it may be classified differently  Here is RAINN's database for the sexual violence laws for every state  Good luck with your healing  and thanks for sharing  https   apps rainn org policy 
It's okay  i understand  take a deep breath  try to write what you going to say  you can do it  is hard  but i believe in you 
Focus on the love passion art aspect of your artistic field  otherwise it really won't go anywhere if you're trying to approach it like a normal job with success in mind rather than artistic expression  
To your edit   I always get energised when I write stuff down  It helps because it's no longer all in your head 
There's also the quote  which I'll paraphrase for now "people say light is the fastest thing in the world  But wherever light travels  it finds the darkness was there first"  Just remember  even if the darkness comes first  there's always the chance the light will find its way

That person sounds like a douche  That's not your fault 
It's OK  it's not really your fault  those first days suck  What's your job if u don't mind me asking 
You are definitely correct that spending time on the internet causes this problem   The dilemma in admitting I have an addiction has many parts   First and foremost  I believe I have a moral obligation to be informed   I think a lot of people who have this problem feel the same way   In the process of dealing with my anxiety I have come to realize that some or possibly even most of the information I consume is useless  in the form of editorial flair designed to generate fear   This whole thing about Trump being literally Hitler is  exactly that    I get what it is trying to prevent  but it is entirely unfalsifiable and vague   It's undeniable that there are people who will be impacted negatively by his administration's policies  but these impacts aren't really being looked at in a rational way   Editorialness goes beyond politics   it is also seen in science reporting   and much of the information consumed over the internet is drowned in it   But the nut in that shell is still useful  and often the nut doesn't come without the shell   The second problem  what to do with my time if I get this out of my life   I automatically go to my phone when I'm waiting for time to pass and I have heard the arguments for leaving it in my pocket and using the time to just think   That's fine  I can do that   But I have too much free time besides that  and often I don't want to spend money so an afternoon on Reddit is to go to activity   I already use my free time to do constructive things that cost no money  but I can't do that all the time   My break from that is Reddit   When I do feel like spending money I go out with friends but the idea of sitting around and just talking   that's one of the things I least enjoy   Any time I am in that situation I feel a strong unease  that my time would be better spent doing the creative things I like to do   That's just me I guess   I need to feel like I am being productive  and consuming information is one of those things when it's not doing something creative   The third problem is that my habits appear to be working   I am doing well in school and I have a great internship coming up   I am not in debt   I have money saved up   Success is what I want  and it looks like I'm going to get it   Could I be more successful if I change   Maybe   Anyway  I've learned to keep the anxiety under control despite not changing  and while I can improve I am looking to help anyone who is stuck in the same loop as I am while it's still happening 
We are fault seeking society  
pretty much i feel like i'm used and overlooked most of the time 
Not that great  That's why we rarely talk anymore  They think I'm a liar  So I don't really have anyone I can talk to about things  I have 1 friend but she stays busy so I try not to bug her with my problems 
I can relate to this showers are the only moments whihc somehow feel my own 
I don't  just a few months ago I noticed I was depressed  everything going wrong in my life  I don't know why I couldn't focus with class and why I lost the strive to do anything  I've only kept this to myself 
 r getting over it  or  r GetMotivated are great resources   I personally follow the Middle Path  A Buddhist way of life  
there's an endless supply of other people     they're just not really interested in getting to know you
Honestly I wish my friends and family would ask me this question more often because it shows interest in my wellbeing   I think if you tell them the truth each time they may actually stop asking  I get what you mean though  I was like that before but lying hurts me and I hate it  Thus  now I've decided to be honest to myself and others  and if they don't like me for who I am then they don't have to talk to me 
Will do  thank you  I take it that zpacks will help with oral infections  I was prescribed it for what was thought to be bronchitis coming on  but since the morning after I've been fine in that regard   If this was anywhere on the bottom row and not specifically where it could actually be fatal  I would be able to handle this better  Same with the inflammation having the tender area feel "heavier"  If that could just stop   
It sounds like a pretty good work environment overall  especially with your boss being understanding  No one can really expect someone new to be perfect at their job while they're still learning  If you stick with it you will eventually get more used to it and find it easier to talk normally  even if your anxiety is still high  It's okay to not be perfect  Like I said  you're still learning  I also have problems with talking normally when I'm anxious and have a tendency to mix up words  forget what I just said  and generally babble and make zero sense  It definitely does make you feel like a freak since you'd think talking should be easy and people do it all the time  But I think it's great that you're trying at this and if you give a big "fuck you" to your anxiety by sticking with it  I bet you'll get a lot better at your job 
Generally when I ask someone how they are i really mean it  I ask this because when I used to be extremely depressed I would wish that someone would ask this to me while expecting a genuine reply  So I figured I could do the same for some too  However I usually get responses like "I am fine" and "Nice" 
I've tried  it doesn't do anything really   
I feel you on that 100   I want to have a girlfriend so badly  I think about it 90  of my day and then when the time comes  I shoot myself in the foot 
It has to do with the way we define exercise  Exercise can be walking around your house for 5 minutes or doing some simple stretches  Have you tried that  
Yeah exactly
I'd say live it to the fullest as long as it can last  Maybe you'll stay in touch and love each other from far away  maybe you'll meet again  What is sure is that you'll have made the best out of it and not given up on something beautiful just because of some idea of getting hurt in a while 
I know the feeling of being overlooked  I am the youngest of four and the third daughter  A life of hand me downs and last choice  
setting realistic expectations and realistic goals can really help with that  It's worth just setting 5 10minute goals for walking outside weather permitting  or stretching on a yoga mat 
Maybe another time  Thank you for helping me work through this  I woke in a better way this morning and went outside and walked for about 15 20 min 
You should see someone  it's a win win  Either you get the help you need to you're proven to be fine and your parents no longer need to be worried
I would definitely be freaking out too  even if you don't have a reason too  I hope it doesn't catch you but the last time noro ran through our family  it just gave me stomach cramps  Nothing more  So if you do catch it  you aren't automatically on the train to puke town  
I called a depression hotline recently  and I was on the phone sobbing  When the operator answered the phone  all she did was say "Hello " in a condescending voice  I was scared and horribly upset over some violence that happened  and I ended up hanging up the phone because she wasn't saying anything  I'm sad that they never called me back or notified authorities that I was in a dangerous situation  Pretty shitty experience 
I opened up to my eldest sibling   sometimes I think she forgot   and my current best friend   they both and I guess they both try to help   some days they do a great job and other days I feel like they forget 
I walk around sometimes but I just end up back in bed
Good for you for setting realistic goals and looking to improve your activity levels  
I was diagnosed at 11  now I'm 33   My mother has been there for me for most of that time  especially the last 3 years       I opened up with my D D group a few years back and every one of us had their own struggles   We grew closer when we learned that we can trust each other       I just told one of my bosses last week about how my depression led to addiction problems   He was shocked but supportive in my goal to quit smoking and stop drinking every day   I used diabetes as an analogy  my body does not produce and process chemicals correctly       I hope you find someone to listen IRL and that you can find the power to share       Don't stress about college   It can wait until you are ready   It took me 13 years to get my BA   those student loans though   they will fuck all of our futures 
I have also been struggling with this lately    mostly this last month  Most days it has been really bad  I haven't been that much into coloring anymore  but hopefully I can find something else to help  I constantly search the web for help  I hope we all figure it out

Thank you for your reaction and good perspective  I also put massive pressure on the relationship I had with her  but do you know or anyone on this forum how to get over it  
With machines replacing more and more work being social  outgoing and charismatic will be even more important if you are looking for work 
I had to work both jobs on NYE  And then had to be back at the second only five hours later  Needless to say  my legs were achy  still are a bit  and I got  3 hours of sleep   woke up once every hour  I guess I made up for it last night because I just slept for 12 hours  I would have slept more  but then I would feel bad for not doing anything productive  I get SUPER anxious when I'm sleep deprived  And at work we weren't supposed to park in the garage but I did anyway  so the entire 8 hours I was worried about that  Nothing happened  Taking my meds every day might actually help  but I don't do that  I just am so bad at remembering  Gettin health care was a joke  it's so expensive  but I just finished college so I need something so my medicine isn't so expensive  I hope I figure this out  I hope my anxiety subsides  I just want to go a day without the pit of my stomach anxious feelings  I just want to breathe    edit  added details
This is not your fault  they are rapists 
It really does take some time to find the right therapist but please keep trying because when you do find the right one you will really see a change  If you find one who pushes medication and that makes you uncomfortable  keep searching  Don't give up 
Call me the devils advocate  but I say don't  I only say this as being someone who has had those same thoughts before  The man I hurt is probably still hurting  but I wouldn't know because we have not kept in touch  I felt like reaching out to apologise would only bring him more heartache and pain  It may also give them the impression that you want to start over again  If that is your intention  then I say apologising would be great  But if you are not looking to be in a relationship with them again  I say that sometimes it's easier for them to process us as being the crazy ones then knowing that we are on an even keel now and don't want to be with them  
Can you elaborate please on your answer  That people tend to always find the bad things in you before good things

Hello  Lad  I don't know if this helps  but I've dealt with OCD for as long as I can remember and picking at my skin as a method of stress relief  Very much like you I keep picking at my acne  trying to pop it all out one by one without even realizing what I'm doing  I also pick at my lips so I'm constantly with bloody cracked lips  What helped me in this case was putting on lipgloss constantly   once they don't feel as dry the skin isn't as 'pickable' I tend to do it less and less  Maybe some kind of sunscreen might help  At least until you go see a professional and all

In a few months you'll be able to do 20 30 in one set 
To life  no   To society  yes   But furthermore you can take risks and carve out your own path
Can vouch for this  As a woman bald guys are fine  Height is not an issue  A sense of humor  kindness  consideration  those things matter  
Quite often the problem with motivation is that you have no reason to be motivated because you haven't succeeded in the past   because you weren't motivated    It's a vicious circle   I really do think that you need to start simple  considering your exams are so close  As I said  focus on working in very small increments and you'll find that you'll be able to get through a fair amount of work without being too influenced by the way that you feel  I really know it's so easy for me to say this but I've been through the same thing and this technique helped me 
Well  I can't get over a breakup from 1 5 months ago  and this makes me feel pretty worthless  Love is nice while it lasts but afterwards  damn  Can't help crying even though I'm pretty intoxicated  yay 
You will get through this and you need to remind yourself that you will  I am a big fan of using a mantra  i e  "You are okay " "This too shall pass " "I am new and learning takes time " It is wonderful that your boss is supportive  Maybe ask your boss to role play a call with you for practice  
Well    I don't think that a designated time or space is needed to "heal" the depressed  It takes a lot of time to come out of depression and start viewing life with a more positive outlook but the realization that will spark the beginning can happen anywhere  Even here    
The problem is that sometimes people in this group get upset when they see posts that are essentially "look how hard it is to love someone with your diagnosis " And this needs to be a place where they feel safe and accepted 
Probably doesn't wanna change it because the diagnosis fucks your life up  Makes it impossible to get life insurance  might make it impossible to get health insurance in the future since we don't know what's going on with preexisting conditions anymore  I wouldn't worry about the diagnosis  especially right now with health care changes  
I'm married  Dated for one year  been married for almost a year and a half    The first time I had a panic attack in front of my husband I was embarrassed and afraid  but his reaction was part of how I knew he would be the one  He wanted to know what he could do to help  He held me  brought me water  helped me focus on something else and slow down my breathing  Since then  we've talked about my anxiety a lot  We've talked about the how and the why and the what and we've talked about what he can do to help and what I can do to help myself  I feel comfortable being myself around him  and that includes being anxious and even having full blown panic attacks    He's been my biggest supporter in getting mentally healthy and happy  I don't hesitate to credit him with a lot  as far as my road to mental health has gone  He's my rock   
Hey  His mother sounds like a jerk  Do you talk with a therapist at all  What are you feeling  I think it sucks that you can't talk to your boyfriend about it  Why do you think he doesn't want to hear  A therapist or supportive friend or anyone like that are good to talk to since they will listen and you don't have to worry about what they'll do   In any case  hang in there  The stressful times will pass and stability in your life is coming 
Don't worry about them OP  You did nothing wrong  Some people just don't like they're job and are just genuine douche canoes  If you wanna talk I'm here and so are so many other people

It's really hard to open up  a lot of people with mental health issues tend to hide it but finding someone you can talk to will really help  You don't need to be upfront with everyone  just find one person whether its a friend or a therapist  Here is a really great article on why it's important  http   blog tranqool com 2016 10 14 emotional vulnerability can be a good thing  utm medium Reddit utm campaign Reddit utm source depressionsr utm term emotional vulnerability
I'm so sorry for your loss  and it's totally normal to have overwhelming feelings and to need a place to express them   r SuicideBereavement is a small but caring community you can visit  and there are also some bereavement resources linked in their sidebar   As devastating as losing someone to suicide can be  these kinds of "think of your loved ones" messages can actually backfire for people at risk  so I've had to take this post down   getting involved in suicide intervention can be meaningful after we've lost someone  but it's also common to need to take time to grieve and heal first before we can do that safely 
Yes  about 10 years for OCD 
I'm glad to hear you've been improving  that's awesome  I remember st  valentine  yeah  Reminds me of a bob dylan lyric  "behind every beautiful thing there's been some kind of pain "
I always get confused when I see those posts complaining about how negative this sub is   We are literally in  r depression  What    what were you honestly expecting 
And end up in debt  But yeah  you are right  I don't gain anything from slaving from day to day 
Do you really     As for help   a year   Two years   Thanks to an injury I'm just getting over financial stability is shaky   I may be able to regain some   I don't even have a college degree   Lately the thing that gives me the most relief is imagining simply not existing   The thought that  "If it gets to much  I can always die " is rather relaxing   Maybe reincarnate in another life  though I'm not hopeful of that   maybe one with better circumstances   Simply floating in the void  oblivion feels like it would be peaceful   It won't be anything  I suspect   it just  will not be  
Thanks for the reply   Did you have a problem with change  I try to change some of my behaviors  but my brain just decides to be lazy sometimes and repeats the said behaviors  even when I'm aware that this is a bad behavior  Did therapy help you with finding strategies to trick your brain into not being this lazy when trying to change

Hi i just opened a post looking for the same thing  PM' me if you want 
First person I was ever truly in love with   told her to get together with her old boyfriend because I was too much of a wreck  Person I was deeply in love with and could even consider marrying  I was against marriage until meeting her    relationship fell apart because I pushed her away because I thought I had feelings for someone else and that made me feel like an awful bag of shit  Someone who I love dearly  one of the only people who experiences the world in the  same way as I do   no longer talks to me   Aside from that  I'm pretty much a sociopath capable of moments of extreme empathy  leading to much pain and confusion  I can pretend to be social but those situations exhaust me and I have extremely few real friends  So  I get some of what you're saying     I hope things go your way
I think what concerns me is when I was young  around eleven or twelve maybe  I'd watch things on youtube that were semi pornographic and most of them if not all of them were girl on girl or just involving girls  And they'd turn me on  Today if I see pornographic things involving two girls together it actually does turn me on  But I don't want to be with a girl  So I don't understand why girls in porn would turn me on  Some people have said that pretty much anything pornographic can turn you on or that it could always be like empathy arousal  where I become aroused because I can relate with how the girls would be feeling in that situation  But that concerns me and it's something I've never really been able to let go of as a concern  
I hate the feeling of crippling anxiety  All anxiety feels awful  but that one is the worst  I don't even have answers for myself  but I do understand how you feel  
Best of luck to you  I suffer from severe generalized anxiety panic disorder and depression  I had three really bad panic attacks in a four day period a couple of months ago  two that lead me to going to Emergency  Last night felt like I was going to have another panic attack  Not a good feeling  Best of luck to you 
It's the fact that it's in combination of being short and bald having one is bad enough but 2's the nail in the coffin  It's not like I have high standards but I wouldn't find an average looking girl before anyone says personality matters  there has to be attraction 
Hmm  Not much else i can help with    I'd try speaking with a therapist or sleep therapist  I know what you feel when you go through it  Everything's size is out of scale compared to everything else and it induces your anxiety  Maybe you're dehydrated and need to drink more water during the day  Or breathing too shallowly    And if all else fails  meditation should help  
Not sure if this is relevant  but a lot of times when I think about things it's not perfectly linear  and I can make points without explaining how I got there  so people will often be dismissive of everything I'm saying  I try to think about what I'm really trying to get across from the start  and how I can explain my thoughts in a normal  logical sequence  whether or not my thoughts actually came to me in that way    If people are calling you stupid  it doesn't mean you're stupid  If you're having trouble communicating  it sometimes helps just to take a few seconds to really process your jumbled thoughts and plan out what you're trying to say  Of course  people can still mistake this pause for stupidity  but fuck them
Hey man  what kind of work do you do

I do the same with my lips aswell  I'll start using Vaseline maybe that will help with that  as for the rest of my skin on my face I'll have to find other tricks to prevent picking  Thanks   
I find that just doing mundane tasks keep depressive thoughts away  Exercise is a great way to just tune out the world for a while  Taking a walk around the neighborhood with music trying to hit the beat of the music with your steps is very effective way for me at least to just forget all stressful stuff in my life  It also kind of makes a good excuse why I sat and played video games for 8 hours afterwards  instead of hating myself for it     
I totally agree  and it's something I say to my students when they're worried about their friends  They want to fix things and make it better but its just not possible  Often a simple  'I don't know what's going on with you right now but I want you to know I'm here for you' is a really nice start  That was they know they're not alone 
This is exactly how it started with me too  If you can push yourself to  you should really try seeing a therapist or social worker  If you're in college  they may offer those services for free   Or if you feel comfortable enough with someone  try explaining everything to them  If you have someone who can just be there to talk to  maybe hang out with even if you don't really do anything together  it can make the days seem a lot less bleak

People tend to focus on the bad stuff  the stuff that went wrong    We gloss over good things  like when you ask someone how their day was  They're respond "It was good" and then vent about something that went wrong    Rarely do people go on and on about how good their cup of coffee was this morning  They don't talk about the aroma or how it made them feel  More than likely they'll talk about how they can't get through the day without it  how they NEED it    People complain about flying  The wait  the baggage check  the rude flight attendant  'I had to pay for my food'  going through customs  No one has ever expressed cheer wonder and amazement at flying 30 000 feet in the air while sitting on cushioned seat in a steel tube with 100 other people   A lot of people at work think how they like to do things is the right way to do things  They think they are the best at their job  They become managers and get to flex their dominance over others  Do they praise and encourage new ideas  Rarely  They most often start 'shaping things up'  'cleaning up the clutter'  or 'tightening the purse strings'    We are a society of nit pickers and complainers  We even complain about Christmas and having to buy gifts  Like  woe is me  I have all this money  and friends  and family  and I have to show them love and appreciation for one day  Some people hate the holidays  They complain about Christmas music  I understand repetition can become annoying but you're listening to music about good cheer towards others  love  spending time with family    Think about the last conversation you had  Did the other person complain about things  Or did they gush and guffaw about how wonderful life is  
I think it's a common misconception and I only really learnt it in the past year  I didn't understand mental compulsions for ages  Always good to learn new stuff

I never really got the "competition" feeling you desrcibed on here  When things were at their worst for me coming here was a way to feel less alone and to better understand what I was feeling  Sometimes I felt numb and couldn't even describe what was going on inside but then I would read someone elses post and they would be describing what I couldn't  It helped me and still does sometime  Now that things are somewhat better  reading here also reminds me of what I felt like before  It reminds me of how real those feelins were  It helps put things into perspective sometimes

Man  you gotta get out   I started meditating recently and it has made me realize when I day dream so much  You got to step out of your head and stop fantasizing  You owe it yourself to experience life   Start Small   You have your life to live  I'm 22 years old and I still don't know what I want to do  but I'm still searching    Fibromyalgia must suck  I would tell you to go to the gym  but I don't know how serious your pain must be  Have you tried going back to school   Do you read books     I guess what I'm saying is    it sucks that your family doesn't seem like they want to help you out  but that doesn't mean you have to just sit there and accept things for how they are  Talk to them about it  or talk to your other family members  Go back to school  that would be my first step  Socializing is a big step to greater things  still learning how to do this myself     In the words of J  Cole  " I know you're desperate for change let the pen glide  but the only real change comes from inside  "

Apparently people's first impression of me "this is the most awkward guy I've ever met"  I've asked multiple people and that's what they all said  And no one wants to be friends with an awkward person  The only people who I talk to are my roommates or people in classes who were forced to stay around me

I and most of my friends in DC feel this way  I don't think it's going to be a nation wide phenomenon though 
A lot of sufferers experience a point where they feel like they aren't themselves anymore  I have it as well after a massive attack in February last year  
Thanks for answering my post   I used to be the type of person to be scared of opening up and showing my feelings and my thoughts  I still am uncomfortable when bother people and still am scared to make them lose their time  I thought I had finally found someone who understood how I felt and to whom I could open up  a genuine relationship built on trust  but my negativity and my problems just drove that friend away  I sort of hate myself for it right now   How do you find your therapist  Where do I start  I tried looking at the Psychologist Order's website in my area  to search for a therapist  today  but I'm just overwhelmed by the amount of therapist and by all the strategies they offer and all the stuff they list    Its just    how am I supposed to choose  I'm kind of overwhelmed

Same thing happened to me   'Duty of care' can be an awful thing  Basically they don't give a fuck about you or your needs or feelings but because the government forces them to have a 'duty of care' they over react like this so they don't get sued   It's a poor solution to a very complex and great problem and the treatment of those diagnosed with mental health issues is appalling   For what other illness would someone send a cop car instead of an ambulance 
Did you try many medications before Prozac 
I am proud of you  In the future I can see myself spending the holidays away from my family  and that is fine  That is what I look forward too also  no matter how bad families are  you can learn from their mistakes and raise your own beautiful family the way you wish yours was 
Just my opinion  both as a cutter but also from your message  but I don't think you're in denial  Cutting is seldom about suicide  regardless of the level of depression  But I agree with  u firefades  go see someone  I think it can only help 
If you feel it's the right decision then good  I wish you luck 
im so glad that the videos could be of help      and im also glad it worked out for you two   
I call it "the second worst Tuesday of my life" for a reason  The only worse Tuesday was 9 11 itself   After school shootings  I avoid the news like the plague  You can choose not to follow political news if it makes your anxiety worse  If you have Facebook  you might want to use it less often or delete it entirely 
Hi  I mainly do web design and webdev work  I also worked in 2 mobile games with Unity3D  but they are not very great as we were a 2 men team and with less than 100 bucks    This year i really would like to publish something more  but i am not sure if i will be capable 
That's a nice way to look at it  thank you   
No  I've never mentioned it to my parents  I want them to be happy and not worrying about me  Should I tell them and get meds     
I don't think talking to someone will help  Most of my depression is due to me thinking about my student loan debt everyday and still failing classes and further making it harder to graduate  
I honestly don't know  Physical pain  No I don't really feel that anymore  as in paper cuts were the worst pain but now running a blade down anywhere doesn't hurt  But  maybe that's one of those 'I hate spinach to death' and then the next day you dont mind it anymore  Emotional pain  I don't think so  ive kinda had an apathetic approach to things  I don't know  
Personality is everything  As long as your happy and confident  you are attractive  Wear nice clothes and wash that head and smile   D
I am nearsighted and didn't know I needed glasses for years so I have a headache all the time TIRED and sore eyes     It sucks  But I'm getting glasses 
I though the same thing for a while  but after my condition improved i looked back on my 'inspired by depression' work and it was mostly crap  I think with more intense feelings we have a more intense connection to our work  and therefore more reverence for it  even when that work is comparatively sub par
 People on reddit who wanted to talk to me have ghosted me    Isn't it fun to write to two different people offering help on r kindvoice and neither of them ever replies  And one of them even deletes both the thread and her account   Thanks  I guess

I've seen it a lot on Facebook as well but it seems mostly to be going around to people who have kids or are around kids a lot  
You know  our society works with the idea that woman sex  The whole thing about 'adding sex appeal' to media involves a woman  Women body is so shamelessly oversexualized that it turning you on is completely normal I'd say  Specially heterosexual sex  It's all about women being the pleasing one and man being the pleased one  Heck  I have this friend of mine that her whole sexuality was built under an abusive relationship and now  because her ex made her watch all kinds of porn with him  she says naked woman arouses her even though she thinks being with a woman doesn't really interests her   
I just took little steps to get there  I told myseld 'okay just get there and if you don't like it you can leave' then once I got there I was like 'okay just walk briskly  and if you don't like it you can leave' and slowly but surely just small steps lead to me actually working out today for the first time in 4 months 
The reason I ask is that a lot of my depression is connected to huge amounts of pain  So what do you think it is that your depression makes you feel  Not the root of it  not why you feel that way  just what you are thinking or feeling at the time

Was it my fault 
I agree    I also want to work out and eat better  but it's really hard when i've got a family who litterally eats chips and drinks soda every  single  day  Good luck with your plan   
Yeah you are right  spot on with the last sentence  Usually people don't tend to talk about the positive things in life   I think that is my problem  i have read around the reddit and it seems that people who want to help others usually are being used and in so you just have to take a "Chill pill" and stop caring so much about others   I actually have got some clarification right now  I like things to be perfect and thats why i think i am failing myself  For an example  someone needs help i have the urgent need to help ASAP  but actually do i need to do it  Has someone helped me ASAP like that person has  Maybe i just need to take things a little bit slower and a little bit chiller and not CARE so much about random people requesting favors   Yes for friends and family you should always help ASAP  But thank you for discussing and finding inner peace 
Okay  I understand  Are you feeling concretely suicidal currently 
That genuinely really helps  Thank you 
FYI  you can only catch norovirus if someone vomits in a room and you literally touch it and then touch your mouth face and ingest the particles   You cannot get norovirus from airborne particles unless you are literally right next to someone actively vomiting or you get vomited on or something  The particles have to go into your mouth digestive system   So that teacher probably evacuated the room because of the smell sight of the vomit  The kids would only have gotten a virus if they'd all touched it  it's nothing to do with being "aware of germs"   I understand the sentiment but it's not great to spread misinformation about this stuff 
Just keep trying     Most of my best and oldest friends were super awkward and that's what made me like them     Edit  I'm the opposite of you and I'm telling you it's not any better  I've always been able to pass easily through social situations but I've never been more than a week away from killing myself because I still think other people's opinions of me are much more important than my own  It's the attitude we need to change and accept that we should say fuck the rest of them  I'm not there yet but it's true  You're just as important as everyone that makes you feel bad  We're possibly the only intelligent life in the universe and we're only here for an insanely insignificant amount of time  I just wish some of us weren't cursed with stupid brains that make everything seem impossible

The identified patient  
Same here  It spoke to me on a level no one had ever reached with me  Music is amazing that way  
Okay  I understand  Have they said why they think that you're lying 
I've been on it for three years  I originally went on it for sleep  It does the trick  I don't have severe insomnia anymore  As for depression anxiety  it numbs the pain for me  but there are probably better things you could take  You could always try it and quit  if you don't like it  
It might be as simple as that she doesn't want to cause you unnecessary pain 
You should have hope  There are a lot of people out there like us  or are at least happy to love us  Each person is broken in their own way and the people who are great partners for us are the ones that don't get hurt by our jagged edges and understand that all we really want is connection even though we are terribly afraid of it as well    I'm not particularly pretty or thin but my husband and I see the best in each other and that's when you know you found someone great because they see the magic in you 
You're welcome
Maybe he just needs time to adjust to a new environment  If he has used the litter box that's a good sign  I would get him checked out at the vet    It's hard to lose a furry friend  I had to have my toy poodle put to sleep in 2012  It was heartbreaking but she was very old and had a lot of health issues  Sometimes you have to the hard thing to spare them suffering    I know it's not easy but try to not panic too much until you've talked to a vet 
I stop drinking caffeine at like 5 or 6pm  unless I'm working that late  then I don't   But I take ambien for sleep  which seems to help that problem

I often like to think about things in the big picture  kind of on the lines of this which is really well put  I think we boil our feelings down too much  Our emotions are so much more complex and beautiful than just "happy" and "sad"  There are some feelings and thoughts that we can barely even describe  I  personally  want to experience all of them  I know it makes me who I am   There is no such thing as normal  There's just you 
That's awesome dude  I learned to programme in Delphi  a long time ago now  working in Unity would freak me out  Never did any webdev stuff  But I can probably take my gaming rig apart with my eyes closed  Dude  you have the perfect vehicle to help you socially and professionally  If you want to publish more stuff then find like minded people  The forums and areas for such a thing are endless  You're guaranteed to find someone that you click with and you'll be pursuing your professional aspirations too  If you ever need a writer or voice actor then consider my services at your disposal   As for the more emotional stuff  you're not alone my friend  I spent half an hour staring at a picture of someone I care about as I cried and listened to The Smiths  So I empathise  
It's really just a matter of getting it all out  Same reason we're all on this sub isn't it 
Just one  Zoloft didn't work for me 
I have seen a lot of posts on social media about people being sick too  It's making me really anxious as well  I am worried about there being a bad outbreak of a SV   It's probably best to avoid Facebook and Twitter for a little while and attempt to distract yourself  That always helps me 
I'm just so tired all the time from depression  It really affects my life  I can't work as well or follow conversation or retain much in memory  This in turn makes me more depressed   This is all mental tiredness  Of course I've been to the doctor a  who have cleared me of any detectable Illness that could be causing it  Physically I am fine   I can run or cycle or do labourous tasks  like landscaping  for hours on end  It's just this mental slowness   Ugh  Don't know what to do 
Keep in mind that some of those people could have food poisoning or something else  Not everyone is as well read up on viruses and stuff as we emets are  lots of people assume if they feel pukey they have a virus even when they don't   Also  idk if this helps  but there's not really such thing as one norovirus season  Norovirus is actually just as common during spring and summer when everyone is getting together for camps holidays etc  but there's less media coverage people talking about it because they don't think it's the "season"    Just remember all the years you've gone  without  having noro  even when lots of people around you seemed to have it  You survived then  right     As long as you wash your hands like normal and don't literally clean up someone's vomit all day  you'll be absolutely fine 
I feel like I want relief   Lately  I think about it constantly   Sometimes I'll be standing at my job at almost cry at the register in front of customers for no apparent reason   I pull it back together in time  though   I might come out of this and be okay for another two months   During those times it feels weird that I even wrote things like this   But I am becoming increasingly aware that it's coming back like a revolving door   Last episode lasted a month  with about two or three in between   Good news  though   It appears my state will cover suicide if it's after a certain amount of time   I can wait that long   If I'm going out  I'm going out on my terms  Puerile  I know  but at least I'll have accomplished something in my death   It would take me at least a day ish  probably  to get the materials I need to do it   I haven't looked up the specific methods so as not to make an impulsive go of it 
This is a terrible thing to say and  OP  you are 100  not at fault  It doesn't matter if you were drunk  they took advantage of you and you are NOT to blame in the slightest  
No  it's not misinformation  If someone actively vomits on the tables and someone 'cleans it up' with a tissue they spread the vomit around  get it all over their hands  carry it everywhere  others touch it  the whole room potentially ends up being a risk for infection depending on how old the kids are  The teacher acted right  Bodily fluids of a sick person are a biohazard  I don't need to be told about how this stuff spreads  I spend way too much of my time researching it and with only 10 100 virus particles needed to infect a person and people threading it around under their shoes  spreading it during the clean up process etc  it's very reasonable to evacuate that room until a janitor cleaned the vomit room with bleach 
I know right   Like I don't get it   I feel better today about it  It's as if a burden has been lifted off my chest  
Memantine doesn't have demonstrated antidepressant effects in humans afaik  It would likely be synergistic for other uses of memantine   Alzheimer's  Parkinson's  drug use  neuroprotection     and help reduce side effects  though

Yeah it's tough to manage different aspects of your life   Try to take it one step at a time   It's okay if you can't do everything at once   Good luck 
I like the idea of pretending I'm in a movie 
Despite my positive experiences  I hear this all too common  Someone I know said only a few days ago she had a similar experience   The people behind the Suicide Hotline ought to be told that their workers aren't doing what they're there to do  and are risking lives as a result 
Yeah  we have a vet appointment in two hours  I'm hoping my version of very sick is the vets version of easily cured     Sorry to hear about your poodle  I'm sure they were a good pup 
That fucking sucks
I know how you feel  I started my first job this summer at a fast food restaurant and after I finished my first day of training  I couldn't stop crying and was filled with so much anxiety that I called the next day and quit  I worry that I'll never be able to have a job like a normal person  
Does eye contact give you anxiety   since its only the ladies that are doing it 
You are not the least bit broken  A little cracked  maybe    But  as Leonard Cohen said  'Thats' how the light gets in ' It seems like you're getting yourself stuck in a self perpetuating cycle  You believe you're not good enough  so your mood drops  Those mood drops change his behaviour  you doubt yourself and your mood drops  He responds    As hard as it may be  sometimes you need to trust that you partner has good reasons for wanting to be with you and that your insecurities are your own  The misconception is that we are meant to exist with insecurities  but that's just absurd  And just remember that you don't get to dictate his feelings  You say you are unlovable even though he love you   that's not your decision to make and you need to accept that  You're clearly very smart and articulate  and I think you're probably quite perceptive  but you can't turn that perceptive eye on yourself   I've made this suggestion before and it has helped  Have a conversation  it can either be to yourself or with your boyfriend  Admit that you feel a certain way about yourself but you know that you can't change his feelings  Make a promise to try and reconcile those feelings between the two of you  It's not easy  it's long  but it could help 
I'm the same way man  Definitely make sure it's not your sleep though  Make sure you are getting enough sleep and that your quality of sleep is good  Even get a sleep study done if necessary 
Apathetic or extreme frustration  I just switch between the two  I don't feel pain 
Some animals are also picky about what food they will eat  My rat terrier is like that  She makes me worry sometimes    Bella was a sweet puppy  Also very quirky  If she saw a cow on TV she would bark at it and didn't stop for a while after the cow went away 
I am the exact same way  It's so hard to explain  Each day I live in the fantasy world of characters from my favorite shows and games  or  like you said  make my own  I'm always daydreaming  I wish I was in those worlds and not here  I'm in fantasy everyday  always tuning out real life  I'm glad I'm not the only one  I don't know if there is a name for this  but that's how it is for me too  It's still hard to explain to people  Basically  my mind is rarely here  it is always connecting things to the fantasy places I know of 
You're so cute  great vid    I see in a post you traveled with only a backpack  I'd love to see how you packed  Packing give me huge anxiety  I'd love to learn to pack light 
You are not lost  you are found  We are all in this together  I understand you completely  i know exactly what you are going through because it is the same as everyone with SA  We feel isolated  alone  upset  unmotivated and more  I've been there  I have walked down a busy street and noticed how people seem to seamlessly interact with one another all the while wondering to myself  why can't I be like that  why can't I communicate like they do  why is it so hard for me  why can't I be like them  is there something wrong with me  who am I  Why me  Will I ever be "normal"     I dont know everything  all I know is what has happened to me up to this point in my life  What I do know though is jumping in at the deep end with no supports  unable to swim and you will surely drown  I never believed in exposure therapy  but the more I think about it  the more it has helped me  I was told that challenging yourself and putting yourself in difficult situations will help with your anxiety and to a point this is true  if your anxiety is based on a specific situation  you can repeat this situation over and over and evetually you will train your brain so that it does not recognise this as a threat  but  on the other hand  if you are constantly meeting new people  you can never truly adapt which leads to constant anxiety in every social situation in which a new face appears  So If your problems are largely related to one task  such as going to a certain shop or something in which the scenario is likely the remain the same  you build up a confidence which dwarfs your anxiety at least enough to function semi "normally"  I guess what I am trying to tell you is that pick something that you need to get done in your life that requires interaction that makes you anxious and pick the least of those and do it over and over and over until you have it down to a fine art  then work upwards  will this be a cure all  No  I haven't discovered a cure all  Will this at least give you a foothold and a place to start from  Yes  After each time you push yourself that bit further  when you are home in your safe space  free from the constraints of anxious thoughts  just take some time and think  let what happened process  stop being so hard on yourself  you are trying and that is all anyone can ask of you  There are so many things I wish I could tell you that I don't know how to put into words yet  Do NOT sit an over analyze every social interaction  you know exactly what I am talking about  when you come home and you start ripping yourself apart because  you think you might have acted awkwardly or "weird"  I have started recently looking into bias modification  basically your anxious mind is attributing negativity before anything has happened  this is a negative bias and part of the negative thought cycle  you only identify the negative  only see the negative  everything seems grey and dull  Some people believe  just like you trained your brain to focus on the negatives you can train your brain to focus on the positives     Never give up whatever you do  The more you learn about yourself and your condition the more that will enable you to help yourself and help others in the same situation  always pass what you have learnt forward  no one deserves to live the life with the mental anguish we do 
What is the disorder called  Is there actually a name for this  
I'm in a similar position as you  Also young and out of school  but completely without motivation for ANYTHING  
I have the opposite    I have to sleep for 7 12 hours a day or I get anxiety attacks from sleep deprivation  Like yesterday  I had to work both jobs and then go back to the second one only a few hours later  I barely slept  I take sleep medication  but I couldn't because I wouldn't have woke up on time  and so all day yesterday was awful  I was anxious af  Sleep does the opposite for me    until I start thinking how I'm "sleeping my life away" as my grandma used to say  You gotta find something that calms relaxes you and do it before bed  
They didn't say the exact words that I was lying  they said he wouldn't do that
Good to hear and good luck   Note  some psychiatrists focus nearly exclusively on medications and you might also benefit from a psychotherapist or similar who you can talk with
You'll get the hang of it and once you do  your whole life will be better and your social anxiety will diminish a lot  Its about learning to rely on people and trust people  and yourself  
We will have to see if it's the food or just his sickness  I don't know  Worried 
I prefer being alone  I'm socially awkward to the maximum too  
can say this out of the blue  She doesn't know that I know her diagnosis  I don't want her to think I'm being artificial  
I'm 45 and you are my inspiration  This year I'm going to at least take a road trip somewhere instead of just going to work and home  Thank you  
You experience these things to such a degree that they make you suffer  Dude  what has someone else's suffering got to do with that  I know you voiced a lot of issues but I'm focusing on the one that's closest to me  You shouldn't feel like your struggles mean anything less than someone else's  they are just as valid  Once you're able to accept that you'll be able to start focusing on some of the root causes of your issues 
yes it has  thank you
I just want to travel the world  eat good food  sleep well  I don't even really know to be honest  All I know is working makes me want to kill myself  I thought it was because it wasn't the work for me but now that I've tried quite a variety of different jobs I'm starting to think it's always going to be the same  and I just can't imagine myself continuing to live my life like this   wanting to kill myself every day I'm going to work
Ok 
It matters zero how you did dress  If someone is naked it's still not okay to rape that person    They are trying to shift the blame on you  They are trying turn around the positions of "culprit" and "victim"  It was  their  responsibility to do these things  it was  their  acts    You are going through a very difficult time  Please try to find support about this  Talk to people you can trust  Try to protect yourself from any harmful feelings of others  Don't take any guilt or blame on you

I feel like I could do many things  but there's literally nothing I want to do that I could make a living out of  I feel so lost and frustrated  what even is the point of being healthy  having a family  living in a nice country and all that if I just want to kill myself 5 days a week  Maybe I'm just a lazy guy  I don't know  It's not like I don't want to do anything  I do want to learn languages for example but that won't make me money to feed myself and have a place to sleep

You'll know her best so you will be better able to answer your question  but you can go about a few ways  Just be direct  'I know you're suffering etc ' Or be more cagey about it  'You've seemed  emotion  lately  you sure it's going ok ' Even if you get told it's all okay still make sure they know you're there to listen  that's always the best start and often enough
Yeah well I'm going to graduate with over 150k in debt with a starting salary about maybe 50k  I hate everything
There is no difference between real life and imagination  they're both abstractions  This is exactly why people can get addicted to video games  In theory  this shouldn't even be possible because video games aren't real  In actuality  both life and games are the same thing   abstractions   So don't feel too bad  Some of my most positive experiences in life have been in dreams 
move to LA
I can second that one can travel on a low budget with planning  Some places are more affordable during off peak seasons especially if you don t have kids in school  You need to watch exchange rates and keep track of where you money will get more and meet people  Traveling and meeting people  supporting local economies is doable  It takes sacrifice though  traveling with friends  sharing experiences  etc   Go to the library and study the travel books  you will see

Its actually not all that uncommon for people to enjoy something that society thinks they should abhor based on their pasts  My counsellor reasoned that it's our way of enjoying something that was forcibly taken from us in a "safe" way   For me  I was extensively abused from 8 15  not only sexually  but he was also physically violent and emotionally and mentally traumatizing to me  too  I also am extremely submissive in bed  and enjoy being restrained  called names and even hit  I call it "acceptable violence"  and the thing that makes all the difference from my childhood experiences is that I'm actually the one in total control  I say no  and it's a no  Nothing happens that I am not 100  okay with  I'm 31 and have been voluntarily sexually active since I was 14  Its definitely not me just working through something  as others have suggested  Ive pretty much always been this way  
Thanks for the reply     I agree that it's come pretty close to full mania  something my psych and I need to keep an eye on  
Thank you for the reply  I know  I really need to get out of this house  I'm starting to get claustrophobic stuck in here all the time  it's like a prison except I am totally allowed to leave   I hear going to the gym helps people and I've really considered it but then there's the problem of being broke and unable to afford it  I don't know what you mean by school  whether you mean high school or college  but if you mean college then I'm unable to because I have no way to get there  plus the courses are out of my budget at the moment  I'd like to though  I really would  Hopefully soon I can figure something out    I don't read books but I've never been much of a reader  Thanks for the support and advice  I do appreciate it  
There isn't really an advice for this  i'm a nice guy and i've been fucked over every damn time  I can't tell you "just stop being nice" but that's the only thing you can do if you want no more of this  The thing is  this world isn't really a place for nice people  everybody is just so self loving  selfish and stupid these days  fuck society   Best thing you can do is to expect absolutely nothing from people  because as soon you think you can count on em  they fuckin leave you

You have done absolutely nothing wrong  The person you were talking to is the one with the problem and should not be working with people let alone people who are suffering  Everything you feel  no matter what size is valid  You matter  NEVER let anyone make you feel like you don't  I have no doubt you'll come through this a stronger person  
thank you for your input  I sent you a pm  Wish you a happy year  too 
Thanks for the reply   I'm glad I'm not alone  I agree  it's so easy to get sucked in

This was me last year  I just kept waiting for an "a ha" moment that would snap me out of my funk  but it never came and I failed all of my courses  It took weeks of spending some time outside in the sunlight to start gaining my energy back  Any little change that you can manage that will break your cycle will help  Keep on pushing through

I don't know    I mean I HATED college  It took me 7 years to finish because I lost motivation after the 4th year  But I did finish  And I do feel like it wasn't a waste of my life because I was actually doing something  I really want to tell you  "no  don't do it" but it all depends on you  I know what it's like to go to school with those feelings of anxiety  panic  depression  It's awful  I think you should get some help  counselor or something  and try again 
Well done  that's a really big step  It took me my entire adult life before I went for help 
I have never smoked weed  Thanks for the well wishes  I don't know why mental health is so stigmatized

And trying to cheerlead yourself into not believing those dark thoughts once they do start seeping into your consciousness 
People always say why can't there be more kindness in the world and when it staring them in the face they abuse it and knock it down  So be who you are still be nice and kind  If they fucked you over and disrespect you cut them out if you let them treat you badly they will carry on  
I don't even need to know you to know you are not a slut and that you are an amazing person  Please don't be ashamed  you survived an attack  that already shows infinitely more courage than these disgusting excuses for boys will ever have 
Thank you  I owe it to my friend who helped me find the courage to actually realize that I need help and that its not something to be ashamed of 
And then when you do finally find a piece of reality to grasp onto  you beat yourself up  and feel like an empty void for feeling like this in the first place and it's the never ending cycle  
I never though I was lovable myself  but because you have a boyfriend who loves you  in my opinion  I believe you are capable of being loved  As for your depression  I've been going through this a lot myself lately  I'm afraid  I haven't had a girlfriend in three years  and it'll be four on the 13th of January  my last breakup    As for whether or not this gets better  all I gotta say is  for me  it ocassionally gets better  but without a girlfriend  I recede right back into the darkness 
and I'm sorry  I wasn't trying to make you feel down or like its not a safe place to  voice out frustrations  but I also didn't want to reassure you  I'm sorry it was stressful  but you did great
You've phrased it nicely  in a way that is somewhat consoling  for people like me who are always in some kind of negative mood and barely function   The problem is that our failure to meet societal standards isn't the source of our suffering  It's just an added burden  The problem with my existence isn't social shame  it's the fact that the experience of being me is viscerally painful day to day  Ridding myself of any and all pressure to be "normal" wouldn't change this fact    As it happens I do see it from an evolutionary perspective  and I notice that the puzzle pieces tend to fit together from this view whereas the religious view is a mess   For instance  why are so many people so unhappy  Because survival and reproduction are all that natural selection cares about  and both can be achieved by beings that suffer immensely  There are evolutionary advantages in traits that make you miserable as a byproduct   If you are afraid most of the time  you will avoid many dangers because you are always in a state of anxious defensiveness  If you are sad most of the time  you will be engaged in a desperate search for happiness   you will try novel things  be more creative  mate with more members of the opposite sex because nothing will ever satisfy you   Of course  there are random mutations and other factors and some of us will get an overdose of sadness anxiety traits   to the point that chances for survival and reproduction are drastically reduced   That explains me  Needless to say  I will not be selected  It's perfectly clear  and it's no consolation at all because I will have to endure myself until the end   
I'm so  so sorry  this was not your fault  You are not a slut  Please be gentle with yourself  and if you can  consider seeing a doctor or a therapist  RAINN org has good support available via phone or instant messaging 
Hopefully everything goes well with the vet  Please update on your Kitty's condition 
Yeah  that's the Risperidone  I think a lot of those meds are cumulative  so they build up in your system  but you should be able to wean yourself off them  Are you actually schizophrenic or are you using them for the other side effects  I'm not doctor  I've just been through a lot of this shit myself   I don't think you'd be going behind your doctors back to get a second opinion about the meds  especially if they are causing side effects   My meds make my hands shake sometimes  and this is such a lame complaint  but it means I can't gently push the thumbstick on my ps4 controller  so sometimes I'll run instead of creep  And run to my death   
your comment actually helped me  I always get a little anxiety right before going back to work after a long weekend and saw two or three stomach virus posts so I'm freaking out a little bit that it'll be unavoidable this season  But you're right the last time the SV hit my house was 6 years ago and that was when my mom was babysitting kids in our house  Now  none of us really have contact with children  who seem to be the main cause of the spread   Just praying and hoping I don't catch it this year  Do you ever get the feeling like  is it my time  Or it's been so and so long it's definitely my time  I guess I'm just having an off day after the holidays and going back to reality 
No  I know I need them  Sometimes I just want to let everything go  though  I have bipolar 1 with mixed episodes and psychosis  so it gets pretty serious pretty fast  There's a part of me that just wants to let it   I used to skip days at a time before I stopped all together  and I know it messed with me  But I also know it works  
go help at a soup kitchen or go buy groceries for some homeless people  anything that involves helping others  it'll jump start things
No therapist will tell you that you were wrong for going to therapy  It takes a lot of strength to go  It is important to take care of yourself now instead of letting problems escalate  You are clearly not lazy if you are taking the first step by getting help  This article may help you understand the different types of therapists and what may work for you  http   blog tranqool com 2016 04 11 what are the different types of mental health service providers  utm medium Reddit utm source socialanxietysr utm term providers
I'm totally crying over here cuz this is amazing  Your happiness comes across in the video and I can't help but be so happy for you 
That's a shame  How good is your insurance 
Yeah  I've got some stories in the bag     including "that time I got uber scammed by some drunk russians"  
Yer I think that's the anxiety  When I'm bad I can't even talk properly and become stupid and clumsy

I think it's good practice for small talk  I think I might try it one night  but put on a different persona    the charismatic version of me  just for practice 
Permanent solution to a temporary problem  I was line you 3 4 years ago  I had a few tough years nothing was changing and I just wanted to go away forever   I was eventually talked out of it and I'm glad that I was    It's one day at a time that's all you can do
100  feel you on the texting thing  It's like the rational part of your brain knows that there is most likely a perfectly good excuse as to why they haven't responded but your imagination can't help but create negative scenarios where she is doing it on purpose  I've ruined at least 2 possible relationships by letting my imagination get the best of me in these situations man    best advice I can give is use patience 
Yeah  it doesn't feel good  It makes me wish I was young again and carefree like them  It's amazing how shallow these conversations among young people are  But I'm sure they're having fun  I definitely think it's worth a try for you  If anything  just to get some exposure to people  though the dynamic is definitely a lot different than real socialization    
I actually went to a 2nd run last night  Mostly normal pay  so a very meager payout  I was trying the 30 trips for  100 bonus  Then I realized it's like a video game trying to make you stay on it longer  And the surge pricing is like pokemon go  gathering people trying to find that rare pokemon  I think those elements make it a little more interesting addicting  What do you think 
Shit  I come from a very broke household so liability  The bare miminum to not have no insurance

I've cut my ties with them long ago  But still  Im miserable and sad probably because of my loneliness   Does therapy really work  Maybe I should go to one 
Internet is a far different beast than meeting people in person though  Also internet friends are nice and all  but it doesn't fill the void for real life interactions  Because I always end up thinking "I wish I could meet you in person but you live 3 time zones away "
It's exactly that  And I actually do believe in God  I believe he is the only one who can help me at this point  I just hope it won't take too long before I get help
I made this mistake of trying to help everyone and asking moderators to make a stickied post about why people shouldn't hate themselves   However  after reading the rules and the moderators reply I realized this is the wrong sub for that  This sub is just to vent  relate  and express concerns  Its a great sub too 
first of all i am sorry this happened to you  You should report this to the police and tell your parents  I know it might be hard to talk to the police but those guys might try to hurt other people and that would be awful  A lot of times ppl do things like that because they think they can get away with it  dont let them ok 
Thanks a lot  We'll give them a shout   I'm still trying to figure out what I would prefer the outcome to be   I'm a little concerned that being on disability could affect her motivation to try to do things 
Hi there  I can really empathise with this   I had bad cystic acne and am a compulsive skin picker  mostly around my fingernails  but also lips and face   I use tweezers and clippers as well as picking with my nails in the vain attempt to make my skin feel 'smooth' and I often pick until I bleed  and am never satisfied that it feels 'right'  I do have some tips to help though   I put plasters over my fingers at night  and exfoliate and moisturise my face lips which makes my skin feel slightly smoother   Also  I tend to pick when I'm nervous agitated worried  so stress or fiddle toys can help to distract  Solving a Rubix cube is a good way to keep your hands busy too  plus it gives your brain something else to focus on  If none of these work for you personally though  remember that there are plenty of people out there with the same compulsion if you want to talk or vent 
Not sure how to respond friendo 
I'm in same boat I've cut people out too for same reason and pretty much friendless now  I just couldn't let them drag me down anymore  If you think therapy may help do it definitely an option  I haven't seeked help about anything yet so can't advise what's good to do  
I was super depressed last month and I came across the song called "Ok" by I C P off their most recent album The Marvelous Missing Link  Found  I love that whole album  I listened to it for a month straight  but back to my point  that sad actually made me feel so much better 
I have Mirena and I love it  I now get normal PMS instead of outrageous suicidal mood swings and not having to worry about my birth control is a huge plus  One less pill to take every day was a big pro for me  too  The initial bleeding sucked and lasted like a month after I had it put in  but everything else has been a breeze  8 5 10 would recommend  
Yes  I hate change  I feel much calmer when I can stay in my predictable routine    I can't say I've had much luck with tricking my brain  It has been more like "screw you  brain  I'm doing this anyway" to consciously change the behavior  otherwise I would continue the same way  Therapy helped me give as much weight to the logic as to my feelings anxious thoughts  It's hard to explain  expressing myself is one of my issues  but it helped my to kind of accept what I'm feeling for the moment without letting it totally control me  I can sort of transition the behavior until it becomes more natural     As an example  one of my ways of coping with anxiety is to over exercise  so I make the decision to stop at a certain time before starting even though it makes me very uncomfortable  to say the least  When that time comes I feel quite anxious about stopping at an "incorrect" time according to how long my anxiety says I need to go  but I do it anyway  I sometimes feel terrible about it for a while  but I am able to think back later or the next day and see that was the right choice  It's a lot of work  but I am starting to do it more automatically and with less angst 
I will  Only an hour before we go   
I love it when I write something like "not so great  you " and they just write something like "good  good   "  You don't have to ask me why I'm not feeling good but don't rub your happiness in my face

For me  I had strong associations with the few episodes where I v  For instance  eating a certain food and then v soon after  For years I would avoid that food and eating it would make me feel n  I finally realized that by exposing myself to this food  aka forcing myself to eat it sometimes and realize that I will be okay and not v  I can slowly subdue the memories that come from the v episode after  In your case  perhaps you can remind yourself when you feel that way you did before that it's all in your head and that you are going to be fine  The more you repeat that mantra  the less and less the anxiety will be around to bother you 
Ok I'll look into it  do you recommend certain types of school like cyber school 
Good  that's a great song  positive  and I hope you feel better tonight 
You're not contagious until you v or have d  And even then  the virus can only be spread through feces or v particles 
I have intrusive thoughts as well  don't google stuff   1 rule is do not google stuff  Also remember you are not your thoughts  as horrifying and disturbing as they might be  it is only thoughts  
I wish I had your courage  You're awesome 
On Facebook  every time a friend shared a news story  I clicked "unfollow all from  news source  " I was merciless  Legit sources  fake sources  clickbait  all of it  It took a few weeks  but now 98  of what I see on my feed is just my friends' lives  It's really made Facebook less stressful  
As someone who has known more or less the same situation  I get you and if you need a random talk with a random stranger anytime   Maybe she didn't know what she wanted  and I'm not going to lie if you really like her it will take a while  But no matter the cause  you're better by yourself than being with someone not fair to you  You should talk to your friends  you might think you will bother them but don't worry they will understand how hard a break up can be  and going out with them should make you feel better  Do stuff you like to do with them  and eventually you'll get through it  Good luck bro
Thank you for your post  I thought I was alone in feeling like this    I feel like there's nobody to talk to because it seems like they just want to "fix" me  My husband gets mad and asks what I have to be sad about   I would talk to my mom but she has enough to worry about   she's listened for years and I don't want to burden her with this anymore   I try to hide it from my 14 yr old son but he knows   I worry that he suffers a bit too because he asked one time why he was sad all the time  I don't want him to feel like that  I know how hard it is    My son and my mom are the main reason I'm still here  some days it's just too hard  But I can't leave either one of them  my mom has me and my brothers but she and I are definitely the closest  I couldn't bear to leave my son alone with my husband  he's a good man but he just doesn't understand a lot  he's in his own world that centers on his mom    Whether anyone reads this or not isn't the main focus  I just needed to get the feelings out   
nice dude  pythong is a great place to start and c  is just good all round 
yes totally  You should start psychotherapy if you have not already  Dont lose hope  there are ways out of this  
Well  yeah  It is extremely unlikely I would be manic hypomanic every time I saw her   my  non genetic  adoptive family has not one but two BiPolar I sufferers  and well  I have the internet  Every single source I've combed from MayoClinic to Wikipedia to  gov pages describe hypomania and mania in a way that is inconsistent with my behavior  I wouldn't even mind if I was being manic  to be honest  but being autistic really muddies the waters for interpretation and it's terrifyingly common to be misinterpreted in my day to day life  especially by the    for the lack of a better word    provincial    and she's been enough of an asshole about it that I really have no qualms saying she's full of shit    Really  I have a huge tolerance for shoddy practitioners due to my condition  I've stayed with toxic psychiatrists and therapists for literally years longer than I should have in hindsight  and this woman is by a wide margin is the worst I've seen  It bothers me to sound haughty given my life and my real respect for all levels of medicine  but she's a nurse practitioner and she has all the earmarks of someone overstating her expertise  The only reason I'm still there is that I haven't gotten off the waiting list for a psychiatrist well covered by my insurance and I need medication in the mean time   
I have OCD as well and have a 12 year old dog  I get anxious about leaving her too  mostly because I just miss her or am worried that she misses me  Then I get anxious about her being anxious about missing me   gotta love the vicious cycle  All in all I just remember how happy we make each other and how great it will be to see her when I come home     Maybe you could take a picture of him with you or have him be the picture on your phone wallpaper  I know seeing pictures of her always makes me feel better    
If I called you a table  would you believe me  Of course not    Hard though it may seem  try applying that same concept to being called a slut    Based on what you said in your post  you were raped  plain and simple  And it sounds like it was planned on their part  If your relationship with your parents is a good one  tell them about this  And as others have said  consider going to the police  
I live in Canada  Im just curious of options out there 
I had the Mirena for many years and am getting the Skyla soon  hopefully  the pharmacy is being super slow    I love IUDs so much   It doesn't mess with my mood  but you may find your period naturally upsets your mood 
I know what you mean   I have to say I notice a big difference when Im not constantly smoking weed   I guess it could be any drug really  but it changes my brain chemistry to the point to where if I smoke everyday I have to have it to feel normal   Now that its been a couple days I feel like Im leveling out and much more 'myself'   As far as feeling like there is no future to hope for  I know how overwhelming that can be   But even though I have those times   hopefully less as time goes on and I continue to work on myself   its good to remember that we dont know everything  we dont know what the future holds   Because of that fact there is always the potential for better things  and thus hope   Thank you for your reply   Heres hoping you feel better and we both just get wiser and happier   
I have a copper IUD and would recommend it for everyone  It's non hormonal which is better for you  in my opinion   plus it's good for 10 years  
Paranoia is a potential symptom of social anxiety   I have had the same problem thinking people are laughing at me from behind or wherever  and have also thought people have said things like you mentioned  fag  about me too   SA makes you over sensitive to your environment and can max out self consciousness  thus making you paranoid    Edit  I don't think I articulated that correctly  Paranoia and social anxiety are different things  But sometimes I think they can go hand in hand  Ex  being paranoid that people are laughing at me  and being terrified and feeling bad about myself for it   
Hey  I first want to say you are not alone  I've been diagnosed for almost a year now and although I have learnt to deal with a lot of my triggers etc    I can go through "waves" of having very bad nightmares and also I do get sleep paralysis  It's so scary so I completely understand where you are coming from  I've found that listening to something calming before sleep helps a little  
It was the best day of my life  and I did say that  Thanks for the advice   
Hey  follow up  I went to the doctor  they made a bunch of tests to me and it turned out im healthy  It was anxiety  purely psychological  I knew it  Im afraid ill live my life like this  Having fear

CBT is cognitive behavioral therapy  where you see a therapist and help rework some bad habits or bad emotional coping skills  CBT for me is seeing a therapist once a week or so and we go over what I did and what I could have done differently  My therapist teaches me to be a better wife through skills and homework  like reading books or doing activities    DBT is dialectical behavior therapy and is more regulated  I went in a group setting  not sure if you can go individually  I did it in conjunction with my usual therapist but he doesn't do DBT  I loved it  it lasted one semester of school  I went at my university  We learned how to cope with emotional needs  and how to meditate  DBT is helpful if you have problems regulating every day emotions  like anger or fear  I still use many of the skills I learned in DBT today    I suggest finding a good therapist first and getting settled and then finding a group DBT group to see to supplement that    Keep in mind I did these things before my first manic break and did it just to cope with depression and feelings  I'm not sure how it would work on mania  but DBT gave me the ability to properly analyze how I was feeling when I went manic so I knew within two days something was wrong and within a week I was on an antipsychotic and diagnosed bipolar type one  I contribute both my years of therapy and DBT to keep me out of real trouble when I went manic    So  tl dr do both  but find a good therapist first because good things happen when you have a good therapist  
I'm the same  I fear making phone calls  I'd rather text  But when I can't avoid it I panic

Well  you aren't going to know   And one big problem we often have is thinking that there is some "perfect path" that we need to find out enough facts to pick   Understand that you have virtually no information that you can get as to whether these people are good or not  and really whether they are good for your issues that you don't even understand yet  so there's no facts to be found as to which to pick   Hopefully that can take away some of the drama over picking one   When I started I just opened Google Maps  typed in "psychologist" and picked the one closest to me  Guess what  terrible way to pick a therapist  and I got virtually nothing out of it   Next time I did the same  wrote down the  12 names in my town  and started googling all of their names until I found one that had papers published and was a member of a psychological association  meaning I thought he took his profession seriously   When I moved to this place  I searched the local subreddit and found a post by someone asking for one  and people had replied with a couple suggestions   I emailed the highest rated one  but he had retired and pointed me at another therapist he works with   It's hard to understand the differences   In general a psychologist who does therapy has more training than a basic therapist   You might look for someone who specializes in anxiety  but I think our issues are pretty basic in comparison to psychological issues  so you can likely get progress from anyone   I don't mean to take them lightly  I just mean there are more specific deeper issues like years long family abuse that you might want someone specialized in that for 
Wellbutrin does have slightly speedy effects  it could absolutely be causing your side effects  I would not suggest changing your dose until you can get a hold of your doctor  who should lower your dose or take you completely off it 
Mirena checking in  I've launched into severe depressions on the pill  so when i needed bc I went straight to Mirena  Hurts like a bitch when they put it in  but no period at all makes it so worth it  I have the odd rogue cramp that can be painful  but the longer I have it  the fewer I get them    However  this is made possible by latuda  The miracle iud gives me ovarian cysts which are at the least uncomfortable and at most very painful  But latuda tends to fuck with lady hormones  and when I started it  the cysts stopped  Without the latuda  I'd probably have to have the iud yanked and go back to feminine products like a neanderthal  Haha  And then only because I'm lucky enough to now have a husband willing to have a vascectomy if needed     Edit  I should also add that I never really struggled with pms  so nothing really changed for me when I started the iud  
This guy is right
Thank you very much  Your answer gave me some confidence  and I'll try once again when I see him this weekend  and if I can't do it  I'll do as you said 
This is great  I can relate how depression can stop you from doing things  so I'm proud of you  
Why is a little awkwardness and shyness seen as the worst thing ever  Like come on  I'll try and be be polite and nice  But nope  I guess being quiet is worse than murder 
The Reddit community has some over the top ultra liberals  It also is full of trolls that move around subs to see what type of havoc they can wreak  Don't let it get to you  It isn't worth it  
I suffer from this too  Check out r CompulsiveSkinPicking   whole subreddit dedicated to this   
I'm so sorry you're going through this  The only thing I can say is that people make mistakes   you were only 13 at the time  I think you need to try and focus on the future and be kind to yourself  it sounds like you are just going round in circles in your head  you should still allow yourself to have these thoughts   but try and not let them consume the life you have ahead of you  
Oh my goodness     This is physical and emotional abuse  Please tell someone and don't believe anything these sick guys are telling you    I am so so so sorry this happened and believe me  it's not your fault 
The antibiotic will certainly help fight off potential infection  And I understand  it's hard not to worry when you're in discomfort  I've certainly been there  An anti inflammatory like Tylenol may help as well  no need to heavy dose here    Good luck 
the tough years are stacking
I don't know where to write it  but I accidentally created the same topic few times  aome net reaction problem 
all I can handle lately is tycho hahaha 
Like others have said  go ahead  just don't abuse it  Try not to smoke until you have finished everything you have to do for the day and then  you can relax and smoke 
Also how do I tell her  that I like her  I wanna do it in person of course  but I am scared  that if she doesn't like me as well  she will feel awkward

Holy shit bro you just blew my mind  like I knew they were similar but wtf you just made them the SAME
thank you for this  I've felt the exact same way about my poetry   song writing  I feel as though the stories need to be told in order for me to let go   but really it's just me refusing to let go of those hurtful memories  I don't know what else to write but I'll try

Yep  that's just the thing that made me hold up  a friend introducing me to unity and releasing those games  I look forward to make something new  and i read the unity subreddit a lot  I really neved asked anyone for help in commercial games because i never wanted to have someone working unpaid or underpaid  suffered of that one a lot myself and never wanted to be one of those people   I figure this year 'll have to force myself to interact more on those subs   Thank you for your replies  i really appreciate that you took the time to answer      same with the people who pm'd  you guys are great  
I would warn you to be very careful here  Any intervention on your part may end up causing her to be abused worse  You cant control her  and she may not be ready to leave  I know that sounds kinda sad  but in all honesty  be very very careful  Shes not asking for you to be a white knight here and rescue her  Your actions may backfire spectacularly  Please check out thehotline org and see the information for family and friends  Things you may expect to be helpful can be deeply damaging  Abusive relationships are very complex  People dont stay in them because they like being hit  Its much much more then that going on  This is why it takes an average of 7 attempts to really leave  And why its the most dangerous time  Please dont just try to make yourself feel better or like a rescuer  
I'm trying to use the rational part of my brain and IL just wait I guess I don't want to ruin this  it's very hard not to message her she's online and sharing stuff  but I don't know what's going on etc so il wait and hope for the best 
Public speaking is a big hurdle for people who don't have anxiety issues    win for sure 
My wife is leaving me
I'm just gonna wait it out  she seemed happy so I hope for the best
thank you 
You'll find something  I'm sure of it
Oh I see  thanks for elaborating  I don't really see myself making music for a living although I do enjoy playing at home  really it's more that I don't see how I could make money with music considering my average skill   Still  thanks for the message
It's nice to know I'am not the only one
Thanks   And to you as well   Just try not to beat yourself up too much  I'm constantly setting goals for myself and I'm also constantly fucking up  Today I slept in until 9am when I   meant   to get up at 5am    But it's not a problem because more often than not  I   am   getting up when I need to    All my life I've been terrified of failure  but I'm starting to learn that it's really not that bad because at least I tried   This internet stranger wishes you the best  and if you ever need someone to talk to  don't be afraid to message me  
I have Skyla  smaller  3 year IUD  and I like it for the most part except I do have pretty bad cramps and minor mood swings  It didn't effect my flow hardly at all except maybe made it more regular   I would recommend taking advil or some type of pain killer about 30 minutes to an hour before your appointment  idk about everyone else but it was painful for me for the first couple days 
You can tell us Here
Well it took me untill I could live with it and it faded away but i still have rare moments when i'm triggerd
What do you mean by "going to be"  I feel like it already is  and he isn't even president yet  I mean  I live on the exact opposite coast of DC  and it feels like the air itself has gotten 10  thicker since the election   I can't imagine living in DC come inauguration day  Jesus Christ  Buy all the guns  take the day off work  lock your doors  and get liquored up

That is awesome that you are pushing yourself  Freeways are tough because you are "trapped" between exits    I know that fear well  And   It gets easier from there 
this video confuses me so much 
I hate not being able to use depression as a legitimate reason for my behavior  My family doesn't understand it  My best friend does  he's coming over tonight    I've been smoking a lot of weed lately because it's kind of immediate meditation and the only way I can do anything or even enjoy my time  I've been a recluse in my apartment alone all winter break because I don't want to go home  My parents just stress me out and have me on edge 100  of the time    I cried this morning because I don't have the motivation or energy to go get groceries or food or get my hair cut  They all seem like ridiculously large tasks  It's all really fucking tough    I dropped 9 15 hours last semester because I didn't go to those classes and now I have to take 18 hours a semester to graduate  Which is way too fucking much for me but I don't have any other option  I quit my job two days ago to focus on myself and school and my parents were disappointed  Everything is just a huge fucking disappointment 
You missed out on some things in high school sucks but you can't do anything about it  In college or university you can do the same kind of stuff I was basically the same exact way in high school knew a lot of people but didn't hang out much  Now I'm a freshman in college and took a chance and went to a school 16 hours away to play a sport in college and it was best decision of my life  I remeber the night of the of the first party and everyone on the team was bout to go out and I was scared shitless but just went and had a great time  Just try and go out and go to more parties or school events and stuff like that if its bad you can always leave  Good luck homie 
When your body's system is unacquainted with an unknown med  it will exhibit side effects   Give it a few more days so your body can get used to the drug  that is IF you can bare it   If the nausea and anxiety continues after the aforementioned few more days  contact your prescriber or doctor   They'd more than likely move you onto a different form of anti depressant  as some depressants are not for everyone    Hope this helps  friend 
My Facebook isn't actually that bad  I accidentally curated myself one of those bubbles you hear about  About 5 years ago  I went through a vicious culling  and now the people I interact with regularly are all  if not aligned  deeply friendly    EDIT      I call it "the second worst Tuesday of my life" for a reason  The only worse Tuesday was 9 11 itself   I know a lot of people feel that way  but I feel a little relief to see someone else type it  How did you  if you did  vote in 2000 and 2004  And what was the sense 
Yes it is  the first two weeks of any type of anti depressant are hell  be patient   good luck  
This is so jarring it borders on a trollpost  Listen OP  you dont understand now but when you are older you will understand what happened to you  Please tell tour parents and call the police as soon as possible so that those boys dont do what they did to you to someone else  This is very serious

I will ask a mod there if I can post our conversation about how I did no such thing  If you find the death penalty for pedophiles abhorrent and deserving or the death penalty  it is not the same as advocating to go out and kill all of them personally   I never did as such  and in the context of all my comments on the subject  including "as a survivor of sexual abuse as a child"   I found it petty  I posted here to vent due to the environment of Reddit that I believe fosters pedophilia and pedophile apologists  Here  of all places  is where you tell lies about me  barely scan what i said  and harass me  And you're a mod    Fuck off  Eat shit and die   And no  that's not a death threat 
woooah    what the hell  That therapist shouldn't be practising anymore   The thing that stuck out the most for me is speaking about no girl liking you because of your interests  never letting anyone know and moving your interests to an actual girl    what the hell   I feel like anyone with common sense  knowing that they're actually supposed to be helping you  would suggest that if you're uncomfortable with your interests you should explore them etc etc or whatever  not give you their opinion on it    jesus christ   Sorry you had to go through that  i don't have a history of abuse and I know that kind of behaviour would mess me up even if he was making fun of something not as private as your sexuality and sexual interests  but wow    that sucks   Hope you're feeling better 
I hear ya  I struggle a little bit because some people who  otherwise  might be very intelligent and compassionate end up believing some very stupid shit  and I feel like I should be stepping in just a touch and saying  "guys  no  This is obviously wrong " But then is that just an overinflated sense of self 
Additionally  I see you're a mod of r documentaries that is apparently now stalking through my profile and attempting to harass me in a sub for survivors of sexual abuse 
When I went on the first date with my bf  first time meeting  we met online  I completely fucked up our date  I ate so slow that we almost missed the movie  it started raining and pulled out my unbrella  only to stab him in the eye with it  I talked through the whole movie  i was nervous and I don't do well with silence  we went to the book store and got super excited about baby stuff and kept pointing it out to him  failed to mention that my best friend was pregnant and I was thinking of the stuff for her  we went to the fireworks and I wasn't paying attention and didn't sit next to him  I felt awkward getting up and moving  so I stayed there  but  we are now engaged and getting married in october     the right person will see past all the awkward and 'bad' things  I promise 
There are things I've gone through in life that were the cause of some of my anxiety and their anniversaries can cause anxiety even when I don't seem to consciously think about them  My victory I am celebrating is  the realization that anniversaries had passed without me noticing either consciously or unconsciously

There are no excuses for rape  The only people at fault are those people who did this to you   I hope that you have gotten medical attention  It's important to look after your physical health   You may want to find support through the RAINN website  Or visit pandys org  Take good care of yourself 
Thank you

They are both the singer  and show her fighting with herself  The little girl acts tough because she's learned to and tries to scare the rational adult away  He is fascinated with her and tries to take care of her  but she is untrusting  When she leaves she makes fun of him because he can't  Then she realizes they need to work together in order to be whole  But only she can leave the cage  he can't    Basically to me its about how innocence becomes fucked up with trauma and our rational side is trying to reach out and calm us  It's an internal struggle between getting well and trusting again  or protecting yourself at all costs  And then at the end once you've learned to rebalance yourself the cage of trauma is still there  You can't escape that entirely  
 look down  Don't make eye contact  Act like you're busy on your phone or using the register  Pretend you're busy  Line up the clothing signs with their heads so they can't make direct eye contact  Oh shit they saw you anyway     Smile    ah shit they think you're faking it now because of that twitch you always have in your left cheek when you smile at strangers  Their eyes have clouded over they definitely hate you now  Shit they're coming over here  Shit shit shit  "Hi  can I help you ma'am "

You didn't give consent and or were incapable of giving consent  which legally constitutes rape  I hope you will call the police immediately to report this  
I find it beyond difficult to meet people  I've been told I seem cold and disinterested but it's more I don't know what to say and I stay very in control of my emotions so i don't really show much 
I felt kind of down the last few days because the mere few friends i have were out partying on New Years Eve  while I stayed in and drank wine with my folks and dog     Kind of wish i was out there with people my age   Oh well  there's always this year     
I have always  always wanted to go to Europe  Maybe one day    
I remember hearing about someone working for the hotline telling someone to just go through with it  Can't remember if the person actually did  but it just shows that not just anyone should be working those lines     Stay strong  Remember  it is just a feeling  It's not you  You will get past this  whatever it is you are going through  The fact that you are still here and able to reach out to this community is proof that you still have at least a little hope and that you CAN persevere 
That's some good sauce  
Thanks  that helps a good bit  I just try and distract myself as long as possible from them
It has been back and fourth  I guess i have been the first to text more often than not    I fell asleep during our last texting spell cause i was really tired  But responded when I woke up the next morning  Heard nothing back  Then I sent a voice message wishing him a happy new year and that the next one will be better still  And a picture  This was on the 30th    Facebook Messenger gives me the added benefit of more information  read receipts and Last Active notice  he hasn't  read  any of them and he hasn't been on for more than a day    I don't think messaging him will provide any benefit  I mean i could text directly to his phone  but Then i worry i'm coming off as pushy or somesuch  It's a fucking struggle when every avenue in front of me involves a degree of mental emotional anguish
They manipulate you  You're not the bad guy  you didn't give them permission  and they abused you  No matter what anyone else says you are a victim of a grotesque crime  and something needs to be done about this  or else they might do this to someone else
I'm a weight lifting fanatic but I do find it far to draining some days  I find it best to have a minimum I can do each time and then other exercises that I do if I feel up to it  It does suck when I have a bad run which ends up being a handful of sets in a week 
Being around my family for the holidays is triggering  I slept with my highschool sweetheart  it's been ten years  and it was magical except that now he's distant  I feel all kinds of fucked up and lonely

I've only rung and got through to one once  She seems very disinterested and for some reason kept asking who else was with me  Which was no one as I was sat in a park alone at night 
The first election I could vote in was 2008  but I remember the elections back to 2000  Gore won in a landslide in our mock election in fifth grade  This year seems like a more depressing repeat of 2000  where Hillary played Gore  Trump played Bush  Jr    and Gary Johnson what's his face played Ralph Nader  I've been told Hillary actually won the popular vote too  a la Gore   My mother said this year reminded her of Nixon winning in 1972 after she spent the summer campaigning for McGovern  but was still too young to vote for him  I'm just glad Trump is less popular than Bush Jr  and Reagan were  though I wasn't around during the Reagan era myself   I voted for Bernie Sanders in the primary this year  and Obama in every past presidential election back to the 2008 primary  I remember a slogan I saw online during the Bush Jr  era  It said "We are sorry our president is an idiot   we did not vote for him" in a bunch of different languages 
Exactly    you're not going to die  OP  It's not like in the movies  You're just going to be miserably ill  Might as well go to the ER and get charcoal to sop it all up so your pointless suffering is reduced to hours and not days 
That sucks man  I'm 23 and left school extremely early like you did so I'm in a similar boat  No education  no possibility of real work  no way to get anywhere or get anything accomplished without help  Shit sucks  I think I would disintegrate if I didn't have my computer to keep me occupied  I'm sorry your family isn't helping you at all 
You are waaaayyy too young to have lung cancer unless you've been sucking up asbestos  It would also be getting progressively worst  Trust me  your doctors wouldn't be able to disregard how sick you were    My former boyfriend died of lung cancer at 27 and he was made into a case study because he's case was so rare  He also had what seemed like a never ending flu and was diagnosed through a x ray   Now anxiety can cause shortness of breath and a small red drop of blood was probably just your throat being irritated    Go back to your doctor and ask for an allergy test and an x ray  That way you'll know what allergies you have  if any  and the x ray will see if you have cancer or pneumonia or whatever 
This is literally me  My boyfriend wants me to go out with him and his male friends and it is so exhausting  Especially in the holidays when he asks everyone out and they could fill a small bus  It makes me feel very uneasy because I dont care about these peopla and they dont care about me and we have nothing in common  I end up being silent while the bf is having a blast and I keep pretending to laugh and smile  I even pretend not to be bothered by their "manly" dirty jokes that sometimes are borderline offensive to women  It is all so fake  Not to mention the horrible feeling I get because I remember I have zero friends  Staying home reading a book would be less traumatic  really    I probably can' t be of much help but I have talked about this with the bf  After yesterday's charade he finally gets it  All I can say is  do your best to talk to your gf about it  Eventually she will realize that it does more harm than good

If you had an abscessed  you'd wish for death  It is so incredibly painful  Like mind blowingly so  Trust me  My husband who is a tough military man was curled up in a ball  crying in the ER    You are probably good to wait until your appointment  Now if the pain is so horrifying you can't deal  go to the ER  But otherwise  you are most likely good 
i kill you then you kill me k   deal
So inspiring and you're happiness is so adorable  I loved this  Might have to take a leaf from your book some day  Well done and congrats x
Wow they are so unprofessional  how can they act like that towards someone who is feeling suicidal  I really cannot understand how a fellow human can do that to another person  It isn't your fault though  nothing is wrong with you and you aren't worthless  Don't let those people bring you even more down  They don't deserve your pain  They literally have no humanity left in them 
Yeah  I could  But He's said that he often isn't online for extended periods of time  And i guess this would be one of those times     Thanks for talking this out with me   I've just been freaking out     
I understand how frustrating not being able to do anything about distance can be  but don't get too mad for something you can't change  at least yet  it will just get worse for nothing  I'll send you a message tomorrow for sure  
Hmm  I see  It is a bit less stressful to know that there is no wrong or right way to pick one  I should almost pick some at random near my workplace and choose from those   Thanks for your help  It is very appreciated 
Thank you man  I can even begin to explain how much I appreciate it  As far as talking  I am probably going to try and calm myself down right now  but I'd love to talk sometime later today or tomorrow  I am pretty much at a loss for words right now 
I sometimes get the feeling I'm screaming so loud in my mind but on outside I'm calm  That feeling is horrible  Talk to someone  I get the feeling when I feel bad I feel frustrated and angry and can't cry so screaming feels like a good release 
I'm sorry that this happened to your friend  Has she been tested for STI's  It's important that she take care of her physical health as well as mental and emotional   There's great information for how to support a survivor of sexual trauma on the RAINN website  You might direct her there for information and a forum that they host  Pandys org is also a great online resource   http   www capefearpsych org documents Rape mensguide pdf The above guide has great information for anyone supporting a survivor though it is directed towards men   Your friend may turn to you for support if she needs to vent  is confused  frustrated  angry or depressed  It's important to validate her feelings and let her know that she is doing the best she can  You may want to have an idea of what resources are available to her in her community if she becomes suicidal  As well  she will need more than a few supportive people to turn to so it would help if you can encourage her to reach out here and to close friends   Allow her to decide what steps to take in regards to reporting and healing  Rape and sexual assault are about taking power and control away from a person  Allowing that person to choose who to tell and when gives them control over their own healing   Take care of yourself while supporting your friend

It's true   if someone meets you for the first time and they have a bad opinion of you for some reason the changes of that person wanting to get to know the qualities you have are slim  But still   we have to have hope here  Not everyone acts like that   some people realize that not only what's in the surface is the real person  So they try to get to know as you are 
I don't know if you can do DBT fully by yourself but I have a DBT workbook for anxiety   I haven't tried DBT in a "real life" setting but that workbook is great    It is very emotionally taxing though   I can only make it through one chapter at a time before I need a break to feel less overwhelmed   It's been immensely helpful though 
Well I had and it was not really effective  at some point they were slightly less awful but since I have uni and a work besides it went back to the same  Thanks  I'll look at it 
They might be shy  and INTERESTED IN YOU  Also  it's normal to glance at others occasionally  Of course  I don't know your situation  so I can't say if this is true or if they're being weird  They don't seem to be avoiding you  just averting their gaze    
That's reassuring  thank you  I had an abscessed tooth extracted before rather recently and it never pained me  I imagine your husband either had bad luck or had his with or without knowing for longer than he should have  maybe   A buddy of mine had one on his upper right canine and got awakened in the middle of the night in extreme pain and major swelling  Out of the blue and didn't know he had it  Knowing this is making it difficult because "what if"  you know 
I'm so sorry man
I think about suicide these days  It comforts me  
OH HELL TO THE YES APPETITE FOR DESTRUCTION IS THE BEST ALBUM EVER HANDS DOWN and it's   really   awesome to see another aspiring astrophysicist who likes the same music as me like dude we're practically best friends now 
Great  I hope to be able to do this some day  Yay for accomplishments 
Call the police 
I wish I could relate to it 
hans zimmer is fucking fantastic  the music he wrote for interstellar is just incredible and i understand why it motivates you  i listen to his stuff all the time while i'm drawing or writing  it just gives my inspiration a boost ykno what i mean  and lamb of god are incredible too  walk with me in hell is my favorite song by them so far  i'll check explosions in the sky out sometime cause i'm always on the hunt for more music
A normal doctor or even a nurse practitioner should be able to help you set up a "get off the meds" plan  You should probably go to your family doctor or the person who prescribed it to you for continuity's sake  but any medical professional should be able to help    If it goes like my own meeting to get off citalopram  you'll sit down and confirm that you are no longer depressed anxious  Then you'll be recommended to taper down the dosage over a certain amount of time  two months for me  until you are free of the pills  You'll also be given a list of symptoms or effects you may have  how to deal with them and when to get a medical professional  
Chalk it up to last year  That's fu   sorry to hear 
I talked to my relatives when they were over last night  instead of just reading while in the room with everyone like I would normally do  
drums look so hard to master and i'm really happy to hear that they helped you  i'm sure they'll help again you just gotta hang in there as overused as that sounds  also if you've not seen the movie whiplash you really should  it's about an aspiring jazz drummer struggling with mental illness and an asshole teacher  
The problem is last time I double triple quadruple checked and there was still an error  I have some OCD like tendencies and situations like this will make me check over and over but in the case of this particular project it's easy to mess up  let's just say the project has a million moving pieces   I know that's why others have before me  but it just makes me so stressed  
  
Me too  Makes me feel like I'm a failure at real life  As in I'm too weak to get along with the real world so I look for an escape  And all the thing I dream of are practically impossible  
Yeah  it's totally understandable and normal  for people with this phobia anyway    What helps me is remembering just  how unlikely  it is that I'll catch anything if I just pay a normal amount of attention to hygiene and what's going on around me  If I'm ever around noro I  will  know about it and I will take steps to avoid it 
Sorry you're going through this too  I've just been a huge ball of anxiety about going into work tomorrow and it's been really stressful  
everyone in this thread seems to feel better after a good dose of rock and metal and it makes me live honestly  it's good to see a bunch of people with the same music taste as me around you know 
Maybe  I don't typically look into his mouth   P   But yes  I know exactly what you mean about the what ifs  However  I'm sure that you will be fine until your appointment  
That's for other inmates  Like if someone in the prison says they're going to kill themselves  the prison will assign a trusted inmate to sit in their room and keep an eye on them so they can call for help if the person makes an attempt  They're not talking to suicidal people on the outside   The people who do the hotlines are volunteers  As the saying goes "you get what you pay for " Some of these people are caring  dedicated people who are intelligent enough to help you  Some of them    aren't  You get community service hours for volunteering so some people are just doing it to get through court sanctioned community service  or to look good on a college app or whatever and don't actually care about the service they're providing or even understand it 
i don't listen to ambient but this just made me want to give this genre a try  who knows it might be just what i need  i'll check out all these artists and maybe give a little update if i get into them
Nothing to say other than I am the exact same  It sucks
everyone could use some classical music sometime  good choice imo
Literally impossible if you haven't been exposed to the virus  And believe me  you'll know if you're exposed to it 
This is only true if you're beside someone while they are vomiting  as the particles disperse into the air briefly before landing  as the particles may land on your lips face hands  But it's an incredibly tiny chance  Viruses of the digestive system need to enter your digestive system to work   they can't do that if inhaled 
Thank you so much ladyorchid  I hope that your work week proves to be less stressful and anxiety provoking as you anticipate  
you sound a lot like me honestly  and i'm really happy to hear that guitar's making you feel better  it really does help you know like it's a distraction but also something really incredible to do and i'd love to hear what you think of the songs i mentioned when you listen to them 
Thanks a lot for the support  I appreciate your help   A  I do believe that if my father were to be imprisoned that foster homes could become a possibility   B  There are welfare systems that would be helpful in the event of my father being imprisoned  or dying   C  I honestly believe that my father wouldn't do it again  but you can never be sure 
it says not available  can you try another link 
I suggest that you put yourself on a wait list to meet with a trauma therapist  It may be months before you meet with a professional but like any other wait list others will drop out because they've found services elsewhere  chosen to try a different type of therapy or have other issues come up in their life   While you wait to begin therapy you can learn a bit more about childhood sexual trauma  There are many books written on the subject  Peter Levine's "Healing from Trauma" for example   Some websites  pandys org  include reading lists  You could also begin to write down what you recall about your abuse and or your emotions around it  You might try using art or poetry to express yourself  No one needs to see your final results  You can tear up everything you create  which may be cathartic   You could visit websites like RAINN  pandys org  etc to see what they offer online  Some websites offer forums that you can join to gain advice perspective  Reading about what other survivors are doing or coping with may help you  You can also continue to post read here and or on the rape counselling sub   Take good care of yourself

Makes sense that it's the case on the west coast too  It probably won't be in super conservative southern states though 
I expect there to be some significant buyers remorse coming down the pipeline quickly due to working in public health  The on going opioid epidemic and Trump's current appointees do not bode well for places like West Virginia  Ohio  Pennsylvania etc  when it comes to adequate federal planning and funding to the problems that come with this  Least we forget that Mike Pence dragged his feet for 3 months to allow a county with an HIV outbreak set up a needle exchange program because of his uninformed beliefs  Unfortunately many people do not think about public health issues until they happen to them and with those states it's not a question of if  it's when 
It is terrible to say because it places blame on the victim by implying they put themselves into that situation  The problem isn't that a teenager was drinking with older kids but that those older kids violated boundaries they shouldn't have violated  I don't think you should be commenting in this forum if you can't comprehend this  
i just checked it out  it's definitely going in my playlist now 
Kinda like hugging the pillow at night  mimicking her presence and then later crushing it towards your body  sobbing and crying because it's not real  Yeah

I just turned 19  my "friends" are also fed up with me and my mental illness  I don't know what to do anymore  all I could do is cry myself to sleep  smoke some good weed  and repeat 
I also found that Sertraline really was not for me  and made me a lot more unstable  Citalopram worked a lot better for me   Don't want to sound like a nagging mother but any drugs tend to be bad for people with anxiety   some in the short term  all in the long term  With unstable brain chemistry  the last thing you want to be doing is    screwing with your brain chemistry  Lay off the drugs  and try journalling to see what you're thinking about and when 
This is such a perfect description

Happy Birthday 
No one knows    The sad thing is that depressed me is so close to normal me that nobody notices    Nobody notices that I can't sleep  Nobody really cares if I don't leave the house in weeks  Nobody notices that on good days I manage to put two hours into my work  currently from home     Beside my therapist there are only two people who know it  I've asked each of them for help  One of them is very experienced and probably could help me a bit  But she doesn't have any time and currently doesn't has the strength to bear listening to this misery  The other one was well meaning but started talking about the autumn weather when I brought depression up  It was pointless 
Okay sweet  Thanks so much
Have a wonderful womb exodus reminiscence day 
I see it as it takes more effort to get to know someone shy or awkward  There's so many other people who are able to connect with others right away so it's not always worth the time to try to force someone open 
You can tell a therapist absolutely anything and not worry about them being able to take it  
Woo keep it up  try to aim for an extra 2 each week    always slowly but surely 
"Intrusive thoughts are a result of your creative imagination mixed with anxiety and exhaustion"  I know intrusive thoughts are shocking or disturbing but they are not you  You have to try to not react to them with fear  Fear   Anxiety   Anxiety   Fear  Instead dismiss them taunt the thoughts  The way I do this is by telling myself  "Whatever  is that the best you got   Give me worse thoughts  c'mon I dare you" What I do by doing this is eliminate the fear from those thoughts  I know it seems crazy to ask your anxiety to give you more  but we need to stop fearing it so it does not take control over us  I keep doing that step if a new thought pops up and then I engage myself in an activity   Staying idle is bad for us folks with anxiety  Find yourself something to do  something that makes you think hard about what you're doing  Like a puzzle or crossword to name a few  If you stay put you'll just end up thinking about your thoughts or anxiety    I learned this from a book I read that has helped me greatly   PM me if you ever need to talk to someone

If you don't want to wait for the blood test results you can go to a walk in clinic and have it done immediately  When I feared it  they literally took 2 seconds and checked and boom I didn't have it at all     Hope that helps   I was TERRIFIED  It was so quick and easy

If you're bad at "chatting up girls" and only of average hotness  you will likely never get someone who is interested
that's actually a really beautiful description ty   i see it now for sure 
I sure hope so  Do you know where his abscess was located 
i try to keep telling myself that   but  ya know  emeto brain 
Hi  It's hard to tell does someone has depression or not  There is so many symptoms  not sure about this word   and they are really personal  Some people are sad and can't get up from bed but sometimes it's really hard to see what's going on    It's important to listen what he wants to tell you because you may be the only persons he's trusting in his sitiation  He can also be scared of telling his family for some reason  For example I haven't told my parents or my brother cause I don't want them to be worried  It's nice he can talk to you cause it only makes thins worse when you can talk with no one  Try to inspire him to go see some specialist  They can tell if he really is depressed and can give him the help he needs    The situation is also really hard for you guys as his friends but I'm really glad you are trying to help him  Be patient with your friend  depression is really a shit and no one can beat it alone  Be strong with him  I'm sure you are a good friend  Beware you don't sink in the same boat as many of us are sinking    Ps  sorry my english  and sorry I'm not a good writer really
I'm the same    was meant to take my two years ago     after many lessons but choked    I am afraid of causing crashes literally anything on the road  Driving at night  freeways   
I am not familiar with that  but that would be extremely helpful  Thanks so much 
It's settled  what grade are you in right now  and do you play any instruments yourself  
If you are noticing them looking at you  aren't you looking at them  too  If someone looks at me  I do look at him  That's perfectly normal     or   Are you noticing it from the corner of your eyes  Because if so  and I am sorry for saying that  that can kind of fool you sometimes    Anyway  I kind of believe it's the first option  You are paranoid and have anxiety  You are looking  maybe even gazing   at other people  They look at you  You get more paranoid and feel more anxiety  And so on and so on 
Indeed  Two and a half years here  and still counting    
I hate touching small objects  especially those made with metal  like coins or jewelry  I also hate their smell

Oh  I'm glad I'm not alone in this fear  as weird as that sounds  
I'm having a similar issue with my neighbors right now as well  I called the local DV center a little over a week ago  and they advised not to call the police but to leave center's cards and flyers in a visible spot near the entrance to the building  It's very hard to hear the violence and do nothing  but calling the cops can make it worse  
I can relate  I take sick days to sleep occasionally  Honestly  I'd disclose your illness  maybe to your boss or someone higher  Someone who you think will be sympathetic  As long as your sick days aren't impacting your work performance  which it doesn't sound like they are   I'd say it'll be fine
It sounds a bit mean almost but it's nice to see I'm not the only one in this kind of position  I never hear about people dropping out of school as young as 13  stuff like that  I'm sorry you're in the same position as I am  it's not a nice place to be 
Most of them have boyfriends though  and I heard some of them talking about how they don't like me behind my back
eye contact from strangers yes o O
i'm in tenth grade and majoring in programming  its not as fancy as it sounds i'm not a genius lmao  and i play guitar i guess but i'm no jimmy page 
I'm sorry you're feeling this way  I just turned 19  been through 8 Electroconvulsive Therapy Procedures  been prescribed meds and nothing worked  I never had a girl attracted to me  ever  
I can't even begin to imagine how you're feeling   I'm so terribly sorry  Stay strong  and be strong for your father and sister  they will need it  
I have been hinting the idea of having a dog puppy in the house  but my boyfriend isn't that thrilled  I think it'd help with my ongoing depression   ptsd as in the past  dogs made me happy  We're in the process of remodeling  so having a pet is probably not a great idea  
I've been through 8 Electroconvulsive Therapy Procedures and nothing has helped me 
c a l l   t h e   p o l i c e   Don't let those rapists and bullies get away with it and make you feel as if it was your fault  
But i feel like its pointless if i see a therapist for only 1hour a week because then it would take several weeks until he knows all the things that i told my friend in just a couple of days    And as im not an adult yet im afraid that they would just say "oh yeah thats a typical teenager thing" or some shit like that  
No  you're not a slut or any of the other negative things they called you  Report them to the police because not only did they rape you  but they obviously assaulted a minor  I'm sorry    
it's very late here    but I've been seeing one in four for over a year now in Ireland and couldn't recommend them more highly  they've been very supportive and offer more services than just one to one therapy     I waited almost a year to start seeing someone  but the quicker you contact them the quicker they'll see you      pm me if you'd like more info     people know I was sexually abused  but my abuser is also dead and was my biological father  and others  as I was used in the production of cp  so i have never disclosed who abused me to anyone in my family as they all think very highly of him  pillar of the community sort of situation      the laws with Tulsa have changed  and again  feel free to pm and I can go into detail of that if you like  but naming someone whether dead or not involves reporting and investigation  
As much as you feel down  you need to call the police as soon as you can 
Feelin' like crap  I don't have any friends in real life and this constant silence and loneliness is killing me from inside out 
I've been where you are now  I've had health care professionals fail me when I was at my most desperate for help  I wish there was easy advice for me to give you  but it really always comes back to not giving up  Break up your problems and deal with them in pieces  one thing at a time  Learn to talk to yourself in a positive way  You are not "subhuman trash" or "the girl who can't even get a suicide hotline to listen " You are someone's reason for smiling  You have something incredible and unique to contribute to the world  Even if you don't know it  It takes time and agonizing efforts to get through a bad round of depression but please  DON'T GIVE UP  Just focus on the next thing    
Fu k   is as if I was reading my own words   Would love to give you a hug  man   
A simple 'I don't feel too good these days' sounds like it might get the job done  Or maybe 'I'm feeling down and pretty bad about myself right now'  Simple   but gets the job done 
Listen to this person as well  If you feel like you need to talk to someone  there's nothing wrong with seeking help from a therapist despite the seemingly negative stigma  It's perfectly normal to talk to a therapist  and they're there to help you 
Understanding ourselves is one of the hardest challenges we face in life  We do things we never would have expected  and things we want to know are kept in the dark to us  The reason I'm saying this is that I felt the same as you for a long time    but I see now  that not having felt passion does not mean you can't    And it's hard to find these things  to understand yourself    but it is possible     Don't give up  try some new things  Think  This world is vast  there is something 
maybe extend your experiment for a little longer  i'd say 3 months  you need time to get through the bad part  have your mind calm down and get bored  then pick itself up again and start getting engaged in stuff   it really only began happening to me around the 8th week  then i became more curious about the world and my own involvement in it and started picking things back up   once you start doing things again  you can start rewarding yourself with a bit at night for a day well spent

No need to apologize for sharing your thoughts  I'm sorry that this happened to you   I'm glad that you have reached out here and have been getting professional help  It often happens in therapy that a person will come to a wall  There seems no way through it  I found with my therapy that I progressed as far as I could with the therapist I was seeing and for where I was in life  I thought I was done but other issues came up a few years later  I chose to meet with a different therapist   Since I work in an agency where survivors get therapy   I'm not a counsellor or therapist  I often hear of clients returning after a break or returning after confronted with other issues  Some will try a different form of therapy and find success  So there are other ways to get through that pane of glass that appears to be blocking your progress  As well  different therapists have different approaches and skills  A different professional may be what you need   It may be worth it to take a break  meet with a different therapist and or try a different therapy approach  I suggest that you talk to your therapist about this Healing from trauma is a journey unique to each of us   Best wishes on your healing journey 
I've been married for 2 years  My anxiety didn't develop until Oct  2016  lots of things going on at my very stressful job and with my parents  My husband was actually the first one to tell me that I may be experiencing panic attacks   Before I knew what a panic attack was  I didn't know what was wrong with me  I kept freaking out thinking I was having a heart attack and kept going to the hospital  My sweet husband would accompany me every time even though he was dead tired from work  Of course the drs would never find anything wrong with me  He was actually the one who pointed out that every time we'd arrive to the urgent care facility  I'd calm down He told me  "i think it's all in your head"  Then I started analyzing it and I was like  you're right  they never find anything wrong with me and I feel so much calmer when I get to the hospital because it's like my "safe zone"  After some therapy sessions and reading an awesome book I more or so recovered  He's been by my side and is always snapping me out of it when he notices I'm zoning out 'cause I'm probably wrapped up in anxious thoughts  He lets me talk to him about all my thoughts  no matter how irrational they may be or if he's heard them a million times before  He never makes me feel dumb about it  he reassures me  and by venting to him  I feel better    At first before I could get a grasp on my anxiety it was a little difficult for us because he didn't understand as much and felt helpless every time I'd be panicking and crying  He stuck with me  and I'm grateful  
Continuing to live is not a weakness  Staying alive takes effort  Every day   
Yes  Keep going  You've started  and that's the hardest part  
My resolution was to be confident going out in public alone  My friends aren't interested in going to bars dinner or seeing the movies I want to  so I used to just not go  But today I'm typing this from a sports bar where I'm grabbing wings and a drink  Alone  Granted I'm on Reddit mobile to not have to talk to people but  hey  it's a big step    
You obviously feel the need to tell someone  a therapist is a choice  find another friend  pm me I feel dead inside already and have listened to other people before  Just don't hold it in  it doesn't seem like it does  but that stuff builds up over time  I know from personal experience  
Yes tell them  If you think they won't understand  start doing some research to provide them  It took a while for my family to really really understand  And although my mom is sad that I have to live like this  she also has been very supportive  And you need that  Medicinally and emotionally  
I always say "I'm still breathing "     Don't have to lie and say you're fine  which seems to pile up  over time  and it's pretty clear what you're feeling  particularly with a little sardonic inflection   It also says that you're not particularly pleased by the fact of the statement   But it doesn't also necessitate further information if none is needed thus avoiding the "what's the matter "   Especially if it's not something specific   People don't respond to "nothing   " like you might expect     edit    I should have said "would ordinarily use" as I've actually been feeling better to a degree recently   After years    wooo    lately I've been saying "not bad"

Happy birthday   
Not your fault  It doesn't matter what they say  They took advantage of you and if they can trick you into not calling the police on them  they'll try it  You can't listen to them after what they did  I'm so sorry this happened  Please contact authorities  OP  Don't let them walk away from this 
Depends on the meds  Talk to your doc
So brave  Great job 
Even IF you chose to drink as much as you did  it's not your fault for them raping you   A   You're under 18  and they're legally adults   B   You were drunk  and that means that  by law  you were incapable of consenting to what happened   C   These guys sound emotionally and physically manipulative and abusive  Combine that with their age with respect to yours  and they're banking on making you believe that they're right for their own benefits  No matter who the other person is  you're never going to be these horrid things that you're being called   You're not to blame for anything that happened  They are responsible for every single aspect    
Yes    I mean  I think so  I just feel so    lost    One day when i was a young child  like 7 or 8  I realized my parents were going to die  And since that moment this continuous existencial crisis mixed with a big hatred towards myself and the world has been growing  I don't know what to do    I had never told anyone how I felt until a few nights ago when i was in a really bad place and i decided it was time to take a step forwards and seak help  So i told my 3 best friends  And now I feel even more awful cause I think they just think i'm crying for attention  because they never thought someone like me could be so dark     So i dont know if this qualifies as depression  I don't even know if this is just a normal thing that everybody feels and i'm just being a drama queen  But i do not feel ok  and I don't know what it's like to feel truly ok in a long while    I wish I did  I wish I knew
So proud of you  You inspire me   
Inspiteration 
Don't let the world ruin that special day of yours   I know too well how lonely it can feel  Remember my answering a question on a group therapy session to say what is good about my birthday   so I said that 'luckily it occurs only once a year'   Accept happy birthday from a stranger   Treat yourself with something nice   Go out  let it by walk down the park or coffee and cake   anything that you don't do for yourself on every day  Anything 
Call the authorities immediately  You where raped  your not a slut  your not disgusting  you are a person who was taken advantage of  The sooner you get tests run on you the better    Chin up  you can get past this  they are the broken ones you are a victim  don't blame yourself they are criminals and will pay for it but only if you act fast    Its not fair  but you can save others the sooner you alert the authorities  good luck 
I rejected to hang out 10 times with 5 different groups of friends over the past 10 days  I feel so tired just thinking about going out  but then I sit alone feeling drained and lonely  What a paradox  Pretty sure they just think that I'm an asshole  they don't think I'm depressed one bit  I hide it well  
Got it  thanks a ton  Feeling a bit better now  being a night owl and having anxiety isn't always the best for me  I  definetly  agree idleness is a recipe for anxiety  I figured that out a little less than 3 years ago  when my anxiety really started getting to me  But I have been suffering a lot from idleness and it's resulting anxiety as I've been having trouble with making friends in school  but my social situation does seem to be getting slightly better  had like an existential crisis on Thanksgiving and have been trying to convince myself to take more risks in life  anxiety has always forced me to play it safe  never living it up like I should be  Anyway  enough talking about my problems  don't wanna seem self centered  Really appreciate your comment  
God damn  this is dramatic af

No one should have to be alone without anyone  But some of us end up alone somehow  It's happened to me too  I have two dogs who help a lot  They force me to go outside and walk a lot in nature and I struggle onward somehow  I'm no inspiration  Lost alone confused and so on  I don't know why I persist but I do  I'm getting pretty old too  I guess it's inertia and low standards  Your desire not to endure too much pain is understandable to me  Sometimes suffering leads to creativity and wonderful art or insights but it's a high price to pay 
The definition of rape is black and white  sex without consent  and consent cannot be given while inebriated  edit  too drunk to consent  which means when you don't feel like you're in complete control  essentially    There's no gray area at all  The names they're calling you and their denial are to emotionally manipulate you  None of the bad things they're saying are true   EDIT  Plus  you're under age  and they're 18 or older  That's a crime in itself so they're already to blame  They're the adults in this situation and they took advantage of you  They have double the blame in this case   http   everydayfeminism com 2016 05 alcohol and consent questions 
I totally understand you   For me  I day dream  ruminate  and have mental conversations with an old ex  It's consumed me and heaped on depression  and I think it's a huge problem that has kept me in depression  So I started looking into Cognitive Behavioral Therapy  Check it out  if you haven't already  The gist is by changing your thoughts you can change the way you feel and behave  but it takes a lot of practice and being present  That's the key for me  being present  In this way I can control myself and not get stuck in the future or the past   Good luck 
I'm not a professional but I am a fellow OCD sufferer and from what I can tell you do sound like you are suffering too  Again  I'm no professional obviously so this isn't me diagnosing you and standing on some pedestal  I suffer with a lot of compulsions too and rituals just like you've mentioned  I suspected for about 6 years that I had it and self diagnosed myself in my head  It wasn't until last year  a few months ago that I finally broke down and saw a mental health professional and was officially diagnosed  Seeing a doctor will help you  Even if it's just to get that official diagnosis so you can stop torturing yourself  There are plenty of resources online to help you too  I wish you well  
I'm sorry  Message me if you'd like to talk 
This is not only rape but rape of a minor  In some states there are no Romeo and Juliette laws and the people would be persecuted like adults raping a child  which is who you are  Not ok    Report and file a police report  Go to an emergency room  Save the clothes that you wore  I hope they weren't washed or thrown away  so that a rape kit of some kind can be done   You need mental and physical help  And there are places for that    Tell your parents   Tell your school   Tell the police 
I used to be super shy and socially awkward  And since lots of girls were attracted to me  there were countless very awkward situations where there were expectation on me to make a step  my inside shouting at myself to do the bloody step   but I never did  I'm much older now  shyness somewhat lessen  but I've mastered the art of awkwardness  But I  don't give a damn about it anymore  And I like it about myself  And true is that this days outspoken people are popular ones and quiet ones are looked down on   
I have exactly the same thing except it is not on my face  it is on my scalp and once I picked it that much it started bleeding and I got infection and had to take antibiotics the downside of it was I have a compulsion for hairbrushing and boy did that really hurt    I have it now and am even worried about getting a hair cut and i look like cousin IT from the Adams family at the moment lol  Anyway I still have to find a way to stop myself and seems like the most hardest habbit ever to break and would like some suggestions too  Hope things get better for you  And thank you for sharing 
I had a feeling that your job would be a call center   My advice would be to get out of there and put in as much notice as your new employer will allow  Most places will respect the fact that you want to leave on good terms  Best of luck with everything  
In situations like this the Internet is golden  Learn to not hold back when chatting online   I met my girlfriend at a friend's party where I didn't say a word  Found her the next day through people tagging pictures    She says I was the worst first date she has ever had because I didn't talk at all  As soon as it ended I was able to tell her I had a good time  and that I had severe social anxiety   We have now been dating for 8 years   
I chew the inside of my lips too and the inside of my cheeks  Never realised how common it is 
Speaking from my personal experience i think it depends on the psychiatrist and your country   some doctors will avoid as much as possible to prescribe SSRI's to everyone and may tell you that you're just shy and maybe give you some propranolol   others will try some SSRI's and see which one will work for you check this also http   psychcentral com news 2016 12 17 study finds cbt alone best treatment for social anxiety disorder 113996 html

this makes a ton of sense  thanks for getting back to me  I'll try to reach out to him more when I can  Hopefully I can get him to see a specialist rather than a psychologist  that way he can get diagnosed

It's good you know you feel "on the spot " To know what's can give you the info you need to decide the best coping strategy in the moment  Self knowledge   emotional awareness For The Win   Do you practice taking a deep breath when this occurs    How about  is there a difference in how free and easy you are soon after some sweat inducing cardio like 45 min of biking   I get wound up and quiet  but deep slow regular breathing takes it down by like 25  and exercise within 24 hours gives me all the relief I need to be able to talk freely 
Going to the gym will   most definitely   change the way you think  It teaches you discipline  gives you confidence  make routine like moves in life  self esteem  it even decreases depression  Not to mention you'll look much better  and we could all use this  If   money is an issue  start in the house   do some body weight workouts like 25 50 push ups every morning  After that  run half a mile  more if you can    Point is  you can do all of this  you just have to change how your living your life  Switch it    MEDITATE   Seriously  your brain will thank you  you are not your negative thoughts     Wake up at 6am   Do said workout   Sign up to get a Diploma  you can't take high school  so go the other route and get your GED     From there  start taking gen ed classes in college  Start in community colleges    Once you start doing stuff like this  you'll be able to add more little by little  and you'll gain control of your life  You're young  be great  Start  Start  start    Like I said previously     YOU OWE THIS TO YOURSELF    Here's the quote that got me off my ass 5 years ago  and I always remind myself when I'm starting to fall off    "Life has no smooth road for any of us  As we go down it  we need to remember that    Happiness   is a talent we   develop     Not an object we seek  It's the ability to bounce back From life's inevitable setbacks    Some people are crushed by misfortune    others grow because of it    "   some lady that passed away and this quote was shared by a family member    I would be more than happy to help you out with anything  just PM me  The only thing I can't help you on  is your will to change  That's 100  you  Harness your will  
I'm so so sorry  You didn't do anything wrong  and I'm sure your mother would not want you feeling that way  She would want you to continue to work on getting better and being healthy  because I'm sure she loved you and your sister more than anything in the world

 to earn well with this you have to be at the top and I fear I will never achieve it   Very  very few people make it to the top  Don't forget that  A lot of people never even make it to a semipro level  Those that do are the ones that dedicate their life to the game from a young age  You have to put in a lot of extra hours crafting your body and skill and it's not something a lot of people have the discipline for  If it was easy  there'd be a lot more players making a lot less money     There are no studies and no jobs that would please me  that I would like  but I have to work or study now  If you can't become a pro player in your sport can you get involved with the sport another way  Work at a recreation center or a stadium so you can be at the games  even if you're working you can be around what you love  Then spend your time playing in an amateur league with friends or coworkers  What about sports reporting  Go to watch games  analyze stats  players  and plays  There's other ways to be around sports without playing    I wish I was never born or I died quickly and painlessly What the hell to do   Refocus your life  If you want to get involved with sports  try and contact some potential places for work  Find out what you can do to get involved  Maybe you have to start off with a random job that doesn't seem like what you want  but you can get promoted or meet people with new opportunities for you  Set small goals for yourself and accomplish a goal every day  Occasionally reward yourself  Try and make yourself happy first and things will come together  Good luck with everything  
Im gonna think about it tomorrow and try to make up my mind  Thank you
I get you  Growing up with issues  one of the number one things that made me feel like shit was the idea that I was different       it almost makes me wonder if you might be better off seeking treatment outside of the army  Would they let you could you get away with it  Take it out of their hands  I dunno  crazy idea 
Yes  I'll look into that  Thanks a lot  I have never dared to seek help  really  I was always too ashamed and scared after a psychologist laughed at me when I began to cry bc she had asked me whether I was sure about my father touching me  It really scarred me and prevented me from ever seeking help again  This sounds awful but it's relieving to know that I'm not the only one 
I get stuck  in a rut  gaming for pleasure escape  and I'm helped by doing something nice for my Body  Afterwards my mind is not so self defeating  I'm guessing I'm unable to think through some feeling thing my Body is telling me    An hour of exercise helps me  or meditation  Particular to me  but I find grooming  trim nails  helps me clear my head too 
PM me if you need to talk to someone 
I suppose something that's more like a day to day thing  Something that could make me feel like I'm leading a satisfying life  
https   www reddit com r Anxiety comments 5lg3o6 i cant function due to work anxiety my mind feels   Thought I'd link this rather than type it  I just spent 2 whole days of my break in bed worrying deeply about all the work I am behind on and how much I don't know on my job  I started contemplating my whole life and how pathetic I am  Now work starts again tomorrow and my mind is exhausted from worry   So you are not alone  and it could be much worse  
They basically can't tell us anything  of course  They gave him a shot for upper respiratory problems  and told us he was indeed drooling more than usual   But we haven't had him long so we're just saying he's an extra nervous cat  I don't know  My mom is being ultra negative about the whole thing and I can't mentally handle the situation so yeah
Sounds wierd  but if you are getting "brain zaps"  take a benadryl   It helps a little  Just thought I would throw that out there as I think there is nothing worse then brain zaps   Also  try the app medisafe for your phone or tablet  it really helps with remembering tour meds 
Thank you for sharing this with me  Sorry you had to go through all of that and I am really happy about therapy working for you  I'm really afraid of putting myself out there  so to speak  I'va had a therapist laugh at me and have never really seeked further help

This is why we need basic income 
This is rape  Is there a rape hotline you can call  Many offer free counseling services    This was not your fault  Rape is not about sex it is about control  How you look or act has nothing to do with it  I'm really sorry this happened to you  as fellow survivor I know some of the emotions you're feeling right now    Do you feel comfortable telling your parents  Or at least asking to see a therapist  
I've always been introverted  Maybe had a very small case of social anxiety  But I've never been an "anxious" person  I've never had any panic attacks  never been scared or nervous of a situation where that wouldn't be considered normal     And then on June 11  2015 I had a genuine anxiety attack  Fear of heart attack  sense of impending doom  irrational fears of random things  was afraid of ANYTHING yellow for example   Wife rushes me to the ER  they pump me full of sedatives to calm me down and tell her I had a SEVERE anxiety attack  so severe that it did actually register on their readout monitors which I'm told is incredibly rare for someone who's merely having a panic attack   Two weeks later I had another one  Completely stopped being a functioning adult of 25 years  Couldn't answer simple questions  couldn't walk  lost all motor control and it was like the sane part of me was locked inside my head  helpless as it watched the crazy part of me take over and say and do things I didn't want to happen  Wife rushes me to the ER again   One week later I had another panic attack  but this time my wife and I worked through it at home   Each time I had an attack  I was dying  I was sure of it and it didn't matter how wrong I was or how crazy I was acting  To me everyone else was crazy  Everyone else didn't know or couldn't know the truth that only I knew  That I was dying   The fear is   unimaginable  And it hurts knowing that only those who go through it themselves can ever truly understand how when you're in the middle of an anxiety episode  that facts don't matter anymore  To me  I'm DYING  And no amount of readouts or explanations can change that   Reality shifts on itself and suddenly the rules change  But you're the only one playing by them now   As I write this now  my last severe anxiety attack was in July of 2015 and my last minor anxiety attack  a standard panic attack  was in September of 2015  I'm over a year now without any issues whatsoever and yet     I'm different  I'm not depressed or suicidal or anything like that  But I'm   scared  A lot more than I ever used to be  It's not real fear   it's not even anxiety   it's just   I don't even know how to describe it   I guess it's like a scar  Or maybe it's like when someone breaks their wrist  The pain is gone and I've healed  but I cant move my wrist as far as I once could     Maybe something similar has happened to my mind  Maybe having those random  unprovoked and severe episodes scarred my mind and even though I'm better now  maybe it's not as whole as it once was   I'm right there with you  I am not the same person that I once was and I don't think I'll ever truly get back to being him  Something in me is broken  It's not major  I function just fine  but something isn't right  nonetheless  and hasn't been since 
I may be able to find another  read  closer  family doctor  although it may take some time to find one here    I've considered going to a walk in clinic to explain what's been going on and see if they can refer me elsewhere  but I don't know if that's allowed  
Your username just hurt my brain  I kept hearing "Sonic The Hodgeheg" and kept thinking it was supposed to maybe be Heghodge and finally heard hedgehog in my head haha    Anyway  I would keep yourself preoccupied before the date  Work on a hobby  For example  if you play piano  learn a new song  Read a book  read the news  If you live in a big city that has their own subreddit  read the news in there  Keep your day filled  Run errands like grocery shopping  Anything can happen during the day  random stuff  and you can comment on that  Watch a movie the night before    "Have you seen      " and perhaps they love whatever actor is in it  yada yada  Good luck   
I can't promise any time during the night on occasion  but I'm a pretty active texter and always make the effort to get back as soon as possible  I'm 31 f so if you feel comfortable  feel free to PM me  
You seem to be looking for answers externally  Only you can quiet your mind  Only you can be happy with your own company    If you never learn to depend on yourself  you're gonna have a bad time  The only thing you have is yourself  It's true for all of us    Once you start being happy with your own company and start to like yourself as a person not only will you be happy but you'll attract people who like to be around you    Look inwards  not outwards 
No  as long as you've washed your hands and all you should be fine  You probably don't even need to do that  but I know it helps me in those types of situations 
Do not contact him  He is harrassing  bullying and abusing you  They are responsible for their actions  and their actions are appalling  Can you call a rape hotline  I can find you a number  hold on 
I'm sorry you've been treated like that  Yes  it's the feeling that I get  I feel as though people were only able to see me as an object to use for their own pleasure and feel sick to my stomach  dirty and unworthy of love   If it were of help  I'm here if you need someone to talk  
Rape is not about sexual attraction it is about control  They are insulting you in order to silence you  They think that if they can trick you into thinking it was not rape they can 1  do it again and 2  not get in trouble    Block them  Do not read their messages  You are going through enough right now  you do not need to be reading their nasty  abusive messages as well  They are trying to get inside your head  
https   www reddit com r Anxiety comments 5lg3o6 i cant function due to work anxiety my mind feels   Thought I'd link this rather than type it  I just spent 2 3 whole days of my break in bed worrying deeply about all the work I am behind on and how much I don't know on my job  I started contemplating my whole life and how pathetic I am  Now work starts again tomorrow and my mind is exhausted from worry   So you are not alone  I am dredding work tomorrow and just want time to stop so I can stay in bed  
Thank you     There was so much more to post   But it started get scattered     With a few breakdowns while typing     The kids will be gone soon    I don't want to make that anymore painful on them    At this point    I don't know    Maybe    I just don't know  
Thanks for the feedback  I'll try it out
Thanks for the love  That's really good advice about the gym  I know it was always just about getting started  then there's this point where you kind of hit a certain percentage of your maximum heart rate and something in your brain clicks  and you want to go faster and work harder  I know what you're talking about   And omg  same  I hate taking stuff too personally  It's like with me and people teasing or being annoying  Like  I know they're just trying to have fun and that's their style of being a friend  but all I can think is like  why are you laughing at me  how do you think that makes me feel  do you think that's appropriate or wanted  I actually tried making myself laugh along once  and the person I did it to still remembers   it came out like something from a Hitchcock movie  really messed up and scary sounding    I might be guilty of being a little too harsh with some of my friends  I'm mates with a lot of people who are struggling with stuff  and sometimes you can see all too clearly what it is they're struggling with  and every time you tell them they have to quit that brutal job  that recruiters are trying to scoop them out of daily  and move to the city where their friends live  that they can easily afford   you're less and less inclined to spend the time running around them and coaxing them into moving their ass      eeeeh  I maybe suck a bit 
Every survivor wants an answer to this question  But there really are no answers  You'll drive yourself crazy trying to find out 'why'  Maybe there is no reason  they might not even know why they did it  
Thank you so much for the reply     Honestly  I really want to  see someone  but I'm scared of telling my mom that I need help  I have told her before that I have wanted help  but she hasn't done much  She keeps on asking me if I still want to seek therapy  and I say yes   I may sound like I hate my mom  but I don't  I love her  and she has done so much for me   Maybe she just thinks this is a passing thing  I think the hardest thing for me is to bring myself to ask for help  I hate asking for help  even when I most need it  I am sure my family will get involved  and my dad has told me to be confident and stop worrying and control myself  but I can't do any of that  I don't want this to be a pity party for me though  you know  People feeling bad for me is weird 
  Well   I guess I have    But  as you can tell  it only means letting someone close so they can hurt you more    
It's possible but sounds way better than it actually is  Unless the amount of work isn't too much  it is very stressful to be travelling and working remotely at the same time  you end up not having much time to see the places you go to because of the deadlines you have to meet and it's hard to focus because you're in a foreign place   you spend more time just figuring out how to do basic things like where and how to use the laundry  where to buy groceries  find a place to live  etc  Still something that's on my mind for sure  but I don't think life is as good as it sounds when working remotely
It's definitely not your fault and those boys are horrible people who broke the law   Please talk to people about this  your situation will get better if you do  This includes reporting it to the police  You did nothing wrong so don't be afraid of any consequences   Also I strongly advise you to go to an ER to let yourself check up  for example  on any possible STDs 
OP here is a link to resources please call them   They have free couseling services and support groups as well as a hotline    https   centers rainn org

Freshman in high school or college  If HS  you can get a work permit at 15 I think  You're supposed to have one as long as you're working and under 18  As for finding one at that age most people I know went into food or retail  Coffee shops  fast food  some with cars did pizza delivery  Theaters usually higher younger people  They're simple jobs that don't require a lot of training and younger employees help keep younger crowds coming in  There should be someone at your school like a counselor with info on work permits   Edit  its also great that you want to work  Having the money can give you more breathing room with bills and you can start building some retirement money  Plus having the experience will help get better jobs  Just remember you don't have to save everything  If all you do is work and your money goes right back out to food bills rent etc  work will become a burden  Put aside a little bit each paycheck as a whatever fund  It wont be much at first but after a few months you'll have a good bit of change set aside  Wanna go for a weekend getaway  Do it  Looking for a new TV  Buy it  I usually set aside  100 month and typically buy something I'd wanted after a few months but couldn't normally justify  Worked out well  I still had some other money to go out to eat or do things  but I got a "big reward" every few months 
I'm in such a state that meeting with friends is hard  Forget about strangers 
I experienced a variation of this during my massive anxiety attack where I was CONVINCED that I was dying   The ER docs had a mental health gal come in and try to calm me down long enough for the doc to draw blood from me  I refused to stop walking   She asked me why I couldn't sit down and I told her that I would die if I stopped walking  She asked me why I thought that and I told her "It feels like Death is tethered to me right now  As long as I'm walking  he can't keep up  If I stop  he'll catch me  But I cant outrun him because we're tied together  so I have to keep moving "  So it wasn't depersonalization of my own self  but I certainly felt as if another entity  attached yet disconnected  was a part of my situation 
oh hey that's cool as hell  D 
This is super cool  Congrats 
Congratulations 
I think it was his back molar  
I have felt for a long time that I can neither be loved nor love another person   I've never had a girlfriend  so I can't pretend to have any relationship problems  but I also don't feel that I love any of my friends or family   I am just hollow and broken 
My mother and my family are somewhat the same in that respect  I guess if you don't suffer from it  no matter how hard you try   you won't understand  I mainly keep quiet about my issues because my father doesn't think OCD is real and my mother thinks one day I'll just stop    I'm also with you on asking for help  I find it hard  It makes me feel weak and like I can't cope    but it is needed  Don't think of it as getting help if that makes you feel uncomfortable     Think of it as ripping off a band aid  The band aid being the diagnosis  Just knowing will make you feel so much better  Although I highly suspected for a while  I never let myself properly believe it although I KNEW     But once a doctor officially sat me down and said "You are suffering with OCD"    It felt like someone had poured cold water on me on a hot summer day  
This had some great points  
He'll fuck up eventually  They always do 
Hi  I mean this respectfully and do not mean to dismiss you at all  but would it be possible to update your doctor with exactly what you wrote in your original post when you get the chance  You expressed yourself very well and provided important information that can help him help you    Antidepressants are also commonly prescribed for anxiety  Although I also have suffered from severe clinical depression  my antidepressant  and anti psychotic  has made my Generalized Anxiety Disorder so much more manageable and has wiped out so many crippling symptoms that made it impossible to function at a basic level 
Well that's no fun  Hope all is well now 
You are not a slut  They unfairly took advantage with you and should be prosecuted as adults for rape  Feel better 
I get this feeling all of the time and I only work part time right now  I hope I can find a job that is tolerable and doesn't make me just want to stay at home and do nothing all of the time 
Please call the police and give them every name and address of these guys  they raped you and deserve to go to jail

This was not your fault they are bad people  
Even though I sincerely think that what you are describing is nothing more than an anxiety spiral  I have pain which makes me anxious  I am anxious which gives me pain   go to the doctor    Even if they find that it's only Anxiety  you will be AMAZED at how effective peace of mind is when it comes to calming Anxiety  Don't go to the doctor to find out if there's anything wrong  Go to the Doctor to prove that everything is fine   That's what helped me  I was having panic attacks because I was CONVINCED that something was physically wrong with me and that I was going to die because of it  Went to the Doc and they proved I was as healthy as a 25 year old could be  Put my mind to rest and with it  my anxiety 
even if the responsibilities and the terror builds back up  at least you're still here to deal with them when you're able to  it doesn't have to be right away  tell your worries to fuck off for a minute   thanks for choosing not to go through with it  the lighter times Will come  eventually
Hey there    I know this feeling very well  I have gone to a few therapists who felt the same about me  But for some reason none of the antidepressants worked for me    Eventually  the only thing I was left with was a benzo for 14 years   I would get a second opinion  After I started mindful meditation therapy and EDMR things got a lot easier  I was actually able to do a taper off my medication and I've been free from benzo's for a good 5 months    It's not easy to control your anxiety at first and I know it might sound super cliche but the gym helped a lot  keeping a journal with things you've accomplished big and small  eating healthy and doing the things you enjoy  Remember the mind if powerful and you are in charge  You tell it what to do   First  I would talk with the doctor about a second opinion  Meds do have their place if you can find one that matches up with you perfect and for that you're going to need a doctor willing to spend time with you  Then  I would give it time and incorporate some mindful mediation and maybe some EDMR  It could be super helpful    Don't stop meds of course without having a provider help you with that and if they start to work even better  I'm still dealing with anxiety but not nearly as bad as it was before  I do a lot of writing and force my brain to focus on the present  That way it can't linger to tomorrow or the past    I hope some of this has helped  
It's so scary to think how short our lives are  and how much time we waste on work  and other things we hate  Seriously makes me envy hobos lol
First impression is very important  If you reveal trust issues right off the bat  then that's all people are going to know you for  the guy they can't trust or rely on  It then becomes a battle to convince them otherwise  But then you have people who are really good at clicking with people quickly  only to be an unreliable person in the long run  They are unreliable because they are popular  Socially awkward people are reliable in the long run because they are unpopular  Yet unreliable at first  again because they are unpopular  You are caring  helpful  sincere and hard working because you are bad at meeting people  You have to be a good guy to the people in your life because without them you'd have nobody
Thank you so much for your post   I am so relieved to see that I am not alone  I have extreme anxiety about death and it takes hold of me via irrational thoughts   I was recently on a cruise and could not enjoy myself at several points because my anxiety kept causing thoughts of a crash or explosion to keep me spun up  The flights to from were torture bc I was convinced the plane would crash and I would die  I am now paranoid and have obsessive thoughts that I have contracted a virus from one of the ports of call  Anxiety SUCKS   The worst part is  I KNOW the thoughts are irrational and there are always logical explanations for everything  My anxiety will not allow me to stop reacting even when I know I'm fine   Like right now I know I don't have some strange virus    I'm dizzy bc my equilibrium is still off from the cruise    It just sucks bc all my anxiety stems from the fear of death  It seems as if the older I get  the worse it gets   It's so comforting to know I'm not alone  Xoxo
Yeah that's definetly true  I just wish I was enough of a presence to demand respect
Very much so  Yay for dental insurance  
Please don't do it  I just read a comment from you helping others and teaching them that life is worth living don't do it  3 we got you 
Absolutely not  Paxil is one of the WORST offenders when it comes to overdose underdose    If you're truly not feeling an improvement with Paxil  my suggestion is to start weening yourself off now and NOT increase dosage  Paxil is one hell of a drug that REALLY fucks you up  I know from experience  and the side effects of withdrawal are   Jesus Christ I never want to experience them ever again  The brain zaps alone      Find a different drug  If Paxil isn't working for you now  a higher dose is not going to do the trick  And I would stay away from Buspar if you can  That one almost gave me a REAL heart attack  like actual cardiac arrest and not the "anxiety makes me feel like I'm having a heart attack" 
I'm shooting myself before my next birthday  Happy Birthday  
Hi  Sorry to hear about your struggles  but give yourself a lot of credit for making the decision to reach out for professional help again  You're taking great care of yourself  and that's awesome   Maybe it can help when you call your doctor's office and counseling center to read exactly what you wrote out loud  I know you must be busy with your job  but if you have the chance  maybe you can also write down a list of any symptoms you've experienced  You can show your list to your doctor and therapist  It can be hard to go back for help and can even feel like a big loss  but it's not at all  This is a huge success because you're taking care of yourself   
Same here    I have to make an important call too right now    You say you feel stupid  I know this thought  It seems so unbelievable that something 'small' like a phone call can be such a huge thing    But you don't have to feel bad  For people with anxiety problems something as a phone call is not easy    The important thing is don't get too stressed about it    If you aren't able to make the call right now it's okay  Do something different  take a walk or do the dishes and get back later  but not too late   Take a pen and a paper and write down what you have to say  When you are in the conversation you can use this to remind yourself what to say when you are getting stuck   And the most important part  Don't take it too seriously  If you are getting stuck  if you stutter  if you have problems to find the right word  that's totally fine and normal  The other person on the telephone probably has the same problems sometimes too   Anxiety often seems to make minor problems huge in our head  But if you keep that in mind it could help you see the reality    Hope that helps you  And don't worry you are not alone

From Dallas    You are an inspiration  Hope I can achieve inner happiness 
One thing that got me through one of my deepest depressions was sending a mass email out to all of my family members  I attached my resume and explained that I needed a change  I ended up with a new low level brainless job where I had not one but two family members to be around   I would suggest something along these lines since you have stated that you need a job and your family is genuine  
Well first off  I'm sure you aren't ugly  and yeah I'm a teen too  well 19   And if they do that while the mum is right there  that's definitely her problem and she should do something  I don't think I could yell at them  even if the mother wasn't there  I just can't raise my voice to anyone
Does exercise help    We were a species which really had to do a ton of ass kicking sweat inducing hard labor just to survive  before civilization came along with its conveniences  taking away our active lifestyles  Helps me to get the heart going  one hour of cardio stuff for 24  hours of peace  Bicycling  yard work  etc also as long as I sweat for like 45 minutes  
This is EXACTLY how I am feeling lately  I feel like I just woke up from autopilot mode from the last 10 years  I have no idea how to lead my life moving forward or why I am doing what I am doing now  
Humans are hardwired for social hierarchy  but some are not  It's ok if you aren't  fuck them  Seek comfort and friendliness elsewhere  Your cat is a great place to start     
That certainly is a concern  The government does not give enough money to live  comfortably  off of  So she may still have to do on call work or freelance in order to help provide  there may be a limit on how much she can earn before it's deducted from the disability cheque each month     Of course it's all dependent on your SO and how she is  but I suspect so long as she maintains socialising with family and friends  participating in hobbies  does the things she was doing prior to disability recognition the transition may be easier   Personally I had have the problem you feared  I was severely socially isolated to begin with  so getting the disability recognition meant I even more so that I didn't have a reason to try and socialise  This made my depression worse  which killed any and all motivation to do anything I should have been doing  I saw the same thing happen to my friend who also has bipolar  And in both our cases the motivation loss lasted about a year before a change was needed  
You know as Mark Twain said  "The more I learn about people  the more I like my dog " Yup  fuck humans 
EXACTLY how I am feeling  Absolutely dredding work tomorrow

Make it a game  The longer you can stay alive  the more points you are rewarded  The more points you are rewarded  the closer you are to beating the battle against depression and suicide  Stay strong 
Depending on the area  country city  you should decide to report or not  I guess you should have actual proof  like being harassed in front if people

Yeah  I have severe anxiety for going back to university campus  especially my building  When I was still a student  just a few months ago  I would finally muster up the courage to take the train over there  And I would sit on a bench for several hours  listening to music or audiobooks  Trying to summon the courage to go to my office and work on my thesis  But I just couldn't  After a few hours I'd go home and cry   A couple of months ago I decided it didn't work and I had to give up graduate school  It was a hard blow  and one I had experienced about a year ago as well  However my office is still occupied by my stuff and I need to go clean my spot  It's just so fucking anxiety inducing to go back there  the fear of meeting fellow students  people who looked up to me  people who expected me to succeed  And just the place in itself   I managed to go pick up most of my stuff and stash all my books in a closet this Christmas  when I knew no one would be around  but I know I'll have to go back someday to get it  I just want to forget the whole place  but on the flip side some of my best years was spent there  I had a great time in uni and it's just so sad that I'm left with these feeling about that place  
Remember  you didn't do anything wrong  As sucky as it sounds  stuff like this in most cases is out of our hands  Our world is strange  cruel  unexpectable and generally sometimes non sensical in it's way by who gets taken away from us  But i'm sure your mother loved you  and knew the way you loved her  I can't fathom the pain you're probably going through  but stay strong  I believe in you 
Your opinion is not needed here  Please leave OP alone 
To reiterate what others are saying   it doesn't matter what you were wearing  They raped you  You have zero blame 
That's all depression is  one never ending internal scream    I hope you manage to heal your pain  
Are you sure you're not still slightly hypomanic and too optimistic about thinking you can afford it   If you can still return it  I would return it and stick with the original plan 
You're just 15  They clearly abused you  tell your parents and call the police 
Oh my god   Iam so so soooo so sorry for you  I can't even imagine the pain you have to go through right now  But you have to be there for your family  Don't be alone too much and do stuff that distracts you  Your mother would want you to be happy  Iam here if you need to talk 
Sadly  this is very true  The only reason why I have some friends  is because we're equal when it comes to how awkward we are  Everyone else kind of avoids us  because of how awkward we are  Another reason why everyone avoids us  is because of the jokes we like to tell each other  They involve a lot of video game movie YouTube video references that a lot of people don't understand  In fact  a lot of people can't even tell when we're joking  Therefore  they get weird first impressions of us  It sucks  but whatever  I don't care about meeting new people anymore  I'm good with the few friends I have  
I do find that breathing is the sort of thing where once I start thinking about it consciously  it suddenly SEEMS like this very difficult thing and can be a vicious cycle  if it were me  i would either try to distract myself with something that would require my full attention  or maybe do some calming deep breathing exercises 
nope  political views differ I guess
If what you've said is true  then these fuckers belong behind bars  I'm sorry this happened to you  Tell the police  a teacher  your parents  somebody about this 
Thanks   It's easy to tell someone that life is worth living and I look around me and see happy people everywhere that obviously think that is true  so it must be  right   Today is a bit better but I still can't shake the desire to fly to Mexico for a bottle of Nembutol   Thankfully I'm a ways off from that   Thank you for reaching out   It helped me today 
I feel you dude    
Yes  It's so hard to take my mind off of it    
Yeah  though just the last few months for me after separating from my family  I still can't figure out how to get over losing that much  even if they weren't good for me 
YES  I love my dog  He's a good boy all the time  but holy cow  was he ever a super good boy after a bad incident a couple of weeks ago   If I could  I would own so many animals because they're just amazing  unfortunately it costs money and I would want to be able to spend all the time with them that they deserve  you know   And you know how people say you need to surround yourself with positive people  Yeah  that would be animals   I don't know what we did to deserve such amazing friends  I mean the animals of course  because fuck people   but sometimes it really makes me feel as though I don't deserve it and I wonder if my dog knows I love him to death and back although he's not exactly "mine"  family dog  
You're not a slut  They raped you  Contact the police ASAP 
I enjoyed therapy  I wish I could go back  just for the talking and not having to fear to be judged 
I did the same  but I was home alone  fun    but it felt 10x better than going out and having to fake being happy about another 4 digit number that contains  365 days  Maybe I'm used to it now 
Not really  but ouch that sounds like it hurts    
Sounds familiar    Do your best to get out of your shell  be brave  be persistent and if nothing works  and you see no hope  move somewhere else  and start a new life 
It's even worse if you aren't caring  helpful  sincere or hard working 
It's not your fault  On the lighter side   there is an episode in the '90s series "My So Called Life" where the most messed up teenaged character ends up volunteering for the suicide hotline for all the wrong reasons   They dealt with it well   If you're up for it  check it out  and it might cheer you up  Most people have no idea of what it's like to be depressed  whether they are a professional or a volunteer   Everyone is an amateur at their job  the good ones are trying to be better than they were   It is not you   Call another line  reach out another way as you have here   It's not your fault 
That's really inspirational 
Thanks for the advice  it's nice to know I'm not the only one 
Damn  man    I hope things keep going well 
I have the same problem  For me  it was when my grandmother suddenly died when I was in elementary school that my death anxiety started   My anxiety over death manifests itself in irrational thought   As a child  I would freak out over very unlikely scenarios  For example  I would stand in the middle of my room in the middle of the night if there were thunderstorms with tennis shoes on in case lightning struck the house   It was always there  but def got to be much worse after I had my son  For awhile  I tried several different meds prescribed by my doc  They helped stop the obsessive thoughts  but totally altered my life  I have ZERO ability to be aroused  even after being off of them for many years  and sometimes my body does not process touch in the correct way  Example  if I lightly scratch my arm it registers as intense pain  For this reason  I chose to do everything I could to manage without the daily meds  I still occasionally use Xanax or some alcohol if I cannot get a hold on my thoughts   It seems the older I get  the worse it gets   I was recently on a cruise and could not enjoy myself at several points because my anxiety kept causing thoughts of a crash or explosion to keep me spun up  The flights to from were torture bc I was convinced the plane would crash and I would die  I am now paranoid and have obsessive thoughts that I have contracted a virus from one of the ports of call  Anxiety SUCKS   The worst part is  I KNOW the thoughts are irrational and there are always logical explanations for everything  My anxiety will not allow me to stop reacting even when I know I'm fine   Like right now I know I don't have some strange virus    I'm dizzy bc my equilibrium is still off from the cruise    It just sucks bc all my anxiety stems from the fear of death  It seems as if the older I get  the worse it gets   It's so comforting to know I'm not alone  I am going to seek out therapy since I can no longer manage this alone  If I find anything on my own or from a therapist that seems to help  I will make an effort to PM you and share  Please share with me if you come across any ideas  I am tired of feeling this way  It helps to know I'm not alone  Xoxo
THIS  Holy shit  this   Nobody gives a fuck about wanting to connect anymore 
I'm in somewhat a similar position  and I'm not going to say talking to someone is going to be a magically relieving thing  but it is good for one thing  new ideas    Your issue is circular thinking  just like me  I'm in school raking up debt and I don't even have a major  with my grades slowly falling  sweeping away my chances at the transfer I want    I've seen a few counselors and they aren't very helpful to me  since  honestly  most of what they say I've already thought of  But sometimes my counselor or my family or my boyfriend will come up with something I hadn't thought of  an alternate thought path to consider   Imo  thinking yourself into a grave can really only be helped by having new thoughts  and talking to someone can inspire that  thus relieving a bit of that circularity 
It's hard for me  because to a extent  it causes bad anxiety  I've tried several things to make it bearable but now it is mostly just the mental connection to the anxiety  rather than the anxiety  
Grape juice   
Whatever responsibilities are overdue have to wait until you're better   Have you let anyone in your life know how badly off you are   Is there someone you can talk to   Please get help and drop everything else until you've found some 
It's definitely a tough road to go alone  feel free to reach out and PM me if you need someone to talk to  What are your current coping strategies 
That's fucking disgusting  I hope the lady feels ashamed  They're dealing with people who are about to take their life and then they just neglect the person and make them feel worse  What a shitty excuse of a human being 
Let me know how it goes  I was thinking about therapy too but I'm a bit skeptical as some people say it really helps and others say it's a complete waste of time  Good luck  You'll be fine   
That's something I plan to do on my next birthdays  Spending it with a whole lot of people that pretend to care is suffocating 
Remember to have fun times with her  too  Things have to balance out somehow   I do know exactly what you're saying  though  A friend I'd been confiding into is getting to that point  too  Instead  I try to vent more on this reddit or something just to get it out of my system  Sometimes I also watch documentaries  or other things about depression or anything that's currently bothering me  When you see people struggle with what you do  you feel less alone  Usually  it pulls me back into reality and out of a really dark depressive episode   Reading posts on this reddit and responding to them does the same thing for me   Basically  I think you just need to find an additional coping mechanism to relieve from pressure from your friend  It will be okay 
  You can communicate emotions and complex messages without saying anything   That's definitely the beauty of art  A personal favorite is film  as the moving form of photography  an already lovely art in itself  cinematography is just so wonderful   Music is another  I find myself disappointed when works of music and film fail to connect with me  though what I connect with might be different from what others connect with  The connection is important for good storytelling      It's nothing to be proud of and I have to be very careful not to wear my illness as "medals"   It's nothing to be ashamed of  either  Don't worry  you don't have to wear it as a medal  Just know that your perspective is also of value to me and to others  I only seek to understand to the best of my ability      We can't even feel empathic for our own species  How can we expect that everyone accesses metaphysics and philosphy   Good point      Tardigrades are notable for being the most resilient animal  they can survive extreme conditions that would be rapidly fatal to nearly all other known life forms   Are those the extremophiles  badass organisms that prefer what we as humans would consider 'extreme conditions'      Why do males have to "earn" their sexuality   I haven't a clue as to why  I honestly think it's quite a ridiculous concept to force onto others  Someone's sexuality is not society's business    If you think about it  things could have gone the other way  if people had decided that gender roles would be opposite of what they are now  at a time when they were still being very actively incorporated into society  if that makes sense   things could have been very different  These concepts are so malleable  and often  people use a greater power than themselves to justify it  Sometimes people would rather use faith than reason or science to make their decisions      I'm not sure if I ever heard something comparable to women   The only thing I can think of as being similar is 'real women have curves'  However  people refute this idea much more often than people refute the idea that men must "prove" their sexuality  People will more often blindly accept the latter rather than the former  It really is unfortunate  to have a discussion about gender requires that both main genders be included  Otherwise  people tend to tune out and get stuck in their own world    Regardless  you definitely make a point  I don't become less of a female  less of a person  simply because I don't succeed  for instance  financially or otherwise      But a man that failed isn't even a man anymore   There are very few occasions in which a woman will be any less of a woman for failing  But we've set men to certain standards that shouldn't even define the whole of the person  i e   you have to have a well paying job and be the sole provider of the family's income   which isn't even very possible these days  and a lot of families have both parents working part or full time   that's probably why the idea is very slowly shifting  I hope    It is highly unfortunate that people are so close minded  I wonder if we've forgotten just how many variables play into the world and what happens in it    And now  to end this statement   I also wish you a  kind of somewhat belated  Happy New Year  Hopefully all goes well  
I get these sensations every so often    always freaks me out  I've learned to monitor the twinge pain if it persists  but after occupying my mind I'm usually symptom free    I read a great analogy once    our bodies are like really intricate machines  like cars or computers  Just like our bodies  these machines can overheat  rumble  or slow down a little bit from time to time for seemingly no reason at all  This doesn't indicate they're broken  dying  or wrong  rather these things just happen simply 'cause    Our bodies are intricate  strong  and very capable   it will definitely warn you of anything to be worried about  Keep an eye on things and keep yourself busy  I'm sure you'll feel these types of things more and more throughout your healthy life  so don't stress   
I eat when I am hungry and hate to eat when I am not  I have been having to make myself eat more recently though because I got out of the habit of eating breakfast and lunch which ended up with me being underweight  
Gave upvotes to a few comments already  but need to add something   Nah  I think I'm fucking fabulous and I'm isolated for no good reason  the person is just a judgmental douche  and or they're judging me for my appearance  I'll admit I'm not attractive    For fuck's sake  I was walking my dog the other night and met someone on the sidewalk  Their dog wanted to say hello to mine  and I said that's totally fine   Stranger  "Oh I'm so sorry he's just a pup and wants to play"  Me  "No problem at all  him too "  Stranger  "How old is yours "  Me  "10"  Stranger  from chill to pissy in 1 nanosecond  "I thought you said he's a pup"  Me  "Pup at heart  he likes to play "  Like holy fuck  you need to make clarifications and walk on eggshells with fucking everyone 
I feel the same way often  Two of my most popular works came out of my worst times  But the reason isn't the depression itself  it's the fact that you were dealing with feelings you didn't know how to deal with  and you struggled to explain and explore them  It was the process of you trying to figure everything out that created something good  not just the state of being depressed  You can think new things and expierence new emotions while not depressed  and with those you can create something you're proud of I'm sure of it 
Just asked my mom to call a therapist and she asked what I think I am suffering from  so I said OCD  She rolled her eyes and moved her head  I feel you  She'll call tomorrow  and hopefully I can talk to someone soon  She said I think you have been getting better with this  but I told her just because  I may look alright doesn't mean I am  I told her about me praying on the toilet  and she said that everyone has fears like that  It's like she's trying to help me  but it isn't working  I said  "the way I handle these fears is not normal" 
Okay  How's their relationship with the person

I have the same thing  I got a really bad virus  my entire family did  so we couldn't help each other  I threw up like 15 times throughout the night and dry heaving  It was absolutely horrible  It's been about a year since then and I understand how you feel    When I think about these moments  and when they replay in my head this is what I do  I inhale  and while inhaling I focus on the bad thought and imagine it being tied up in a bag  As I exhale  I imagine it flying into a garbage can  then taped shut and then set on fire  It's magic because it really stops me from thinking about it  Lol  You should try something like this
When I first started driving I was super confident because we started on really quiet roads  I could already drive before I took lessons and felt like I was king of the world  The second I had to start learning manoeuvres and facing traffic was when I became like you  Scared of causing an accident or holding people up    Surprisingly people are actually really considerate towards learners when they are with instructors  drivers will usually give you plenty of room  As for dealing with the anxiety side of it  I used to ask the instructor if I could have the radio on for a little background noise and distraction  It helped massively  If you are 100  focused on the driving you will be more nervous and make more mistakes  Sounds stupid but that's exactly what I experienced  You need about 2  of your mind focusing on something else to keep you calm  in my case it was the radio  hope this kinda helped  
Try Ativan it works well for me
If you already covered topic of hobbies then I'd suggest to do some research and learn more about her hobbies  Like that you can let her talk in depth about her interests  You can invite her for a movie and then you can both discuss the movie you just watched  Think of some interesting stories that happened to you and consider sharing them with her  You can ask her to share some cool stories with you as well  When in doubt ask her about her

Congrats on the interview    I know how you feel   I get anxiety when I go on interviews too  What helps me is remembering that they called me in for a reason  and they wouldn't have done that if they didn't think I had something that might fit for them  Also  I'm interviewing them too  in a way  to make sure that they're a right fit for me    Not that this is anxiety specific  but you could use something from another field for your current one  For example  I'm in library school right now  and I don't have a ton of experience  but I volunteer and can use that experience  customer service  and relate that to libraries   Good luck   D 
Hmm If the vet didn't have ideas he might be OK  My sister has a cat that's a drooler  He's totally healthy  Just slobbery  Maybe the respiratory issue is making him drool because he's breathing more through his mouth 
Hey  I was in your boat 4 years ago  Dropped out in the middle of a semester no less due to massive depression  Worked retail  saved some money and really gathered perspective on what field I wanted to be in  Went back to community college and I graduate in a year  debt free  Congrats  I hope you take this time to find your skills  passions  and find out what you want  Much better than staying in college just because someone  not you  says you should  Good luck OP 
This is a pretty good way to put it  I wonder whats making us smell the roses  Its inevitable that things will change if you continue to maintain that attitude about "wanting to shine' fuck yeah dude 
You're a great inspiration thank you for sharing your journey with us  
Yeah its possible to be in a normal state for a year or so without depression and mania even if you do have bipolar and are not on medications  But the mania and depression eventually comes no doubt  Even with medication which just lessens the severity and frequency 
Find something you like to do  Anything  Just some form of escapism that can distract you from your mind and what you're thinking  Trust me  once you find something you love to do  you will gradually start feeling better about yourself  I'm not quite there myself yet  but since discovering what makes me happy I'm starting to feel a hell of a lot better  One thing you cannot do is 100  rely on other people to fulfil your happiness  You need a balanced mixture of things  
I want everyone to be happy  both of egotistical reasons and for the other person's sake 
I have an orange cat too and he's such a pal  Sadly I moved to a shitty small apartment and he doesn't fit here  But I swear to god the only reason I visit my parents is because of him  I just lay in my bed and cuddle him and forget everything  It warms my heart to see how he misses me and truly enjoys my presence  He loves the scrubbing I give him   
As someone who sometimes drink when I'm feeling down  this is the worst thing ever  It magnifies that despair SO HARD   Drinking is causing you problems  you need to try to do something about that  I don't know what it feels like to be addicted to alcohol or feel a "need" for it  so I don't want to suggest anything and be ignorant  Don't lose hope that you can apologize to people and rebuild things  Just remember that the most important component to an apology is telling your friend what you will do differently next time  and sticking to it 
You also went at the best possible time to D C    The cherry blossom is beautiful and everybody is happier because the city is so beautiful    I loved the video  it inspired me to get up and do more things that I enjoy but avoid because of anxiety  Thank you so much for sharing 
Touched my weiner  Can confirm I have it  Seems more like a nerve ending or blood vessels  
If you only sleep and play games  you might very well have back issues from a poor posture   bent forward gaming desktop posture    Apart from that  health anxiety is very common  either way it's a good idea to get an appointment with a doc 
I am that friend for someone  Thank you for reminding me how important that is for some people 
What did you do to overcome them

The thing is that I can open up and be comfortable around people  but it takes some time  Honestly  I'd say this a cultural problem   We're expected to be super open and talkative to complete strangers  but in many other cultures  like in most of Europe  people generally don't talk to strangers and aren't open with people until they get to know them  But if you get to know them over time and gain trust  you'll have made a friend for life   It's actually a real cultural phenomenon  Called the peach vs coconut   https   hbr org 2014 05 one reason cross cultural small talk is so tricky  Peach cultures  Very friendly and open on the surface  People talk easily to strangers  move to first name basis and open to asking personal questions  But quickly you hit the "pit" where the person will no longer reveal anything more   Coconut cultures  People are more closed off to strangers  they won't talk or ask many personal questions  But when you get to know them better and the relationship and friendship builds they'll become more open and treat you like family   I feel like I'm the latter stuck in a culture that's the former  And because of that  I'm not given a chance to build that relationship and trust  I really do feel very lost and unwelcome in North American culture

Thanks mama megs I appreciate the insight on this  I was kind of worried about it  as I didn't know if it was ok to feel this or if it was the result of trauma  That makes me happy to know it's not a repressed psychological issue  As Ive been working with my trauma therapist for close to ten months to address everything  Thanks   Fenea
I don't really see that as being rude  more so asking for clarification which is something that happens a lot in normal conversation  To be honest  if someone told me their dog was a pup then said he was ten I would be somewhat confused as well   Of course  this is coming from my opinion and as far as I know he could have said it like a total asshole  just saying my thoughts 
Deep breaths in through the nose  slowly exhale through the mouth  Try about 10 in a row  Another option is to look for a good guided meditation or relaxation video on YouTube  Good luck

Thank you so much for your kind words  I wasn't able to today  but I'm gonna try again tomorrow  and definitely write stuff down  I don't even know why I didn't think of that    Thank you  again  I really  really needed that  
yes I feel the same way  my resting state is anxiety  when my anxiety fades  I dont know where to even begin and start getting anxious until i reach my normal anxious resting state where I am somehow more comfortable and familiar  
Yes  I hope it will  And sorry  I didn't mean to sound so dismissive  I'm genuinely curious as to what it is I seem to be missing here  I'm willing to try anything that might help  so was wondering if you'd tried it yourself or could offer further advice  Thank you 
That sounds like mania to me  I'm guessing it just isn't talked about as much because it may not be as common as depression  or other things  But it is very real and I'm sure it can be debilitating  too   Too much of anything is awful 
You need to see someone different  Not everyone understands  even if they're educated and should know better  
Could you teach languages to other people  Or even try teaching English abroad because you have a desire to travel 
I had it as a secret too  Until all knew at once that I want to see a therapist  It felt embarrassing  As if my clothes were pulled right from me  But I guess they were ok  I had cousins in deeper shit than me and I loved talking and sharing with them  My parents were a bit worse  because they had no clue how to help  But slowly I made it clear that giving me space is the best they can do  And things generally went better  They've become much more free with me and have no control over my life anymore  I feel free thanks to that 
It's possible to have anxiety all day  every day  I think a lot of people on this sub have this issue  I certainly do    I don't know if it helps  but one thing that seems to help  as ridiculous as it sounds  is to talk back to my stomach  that's where my anxiety messes me up the most  and be like "oh shut up" or "be quiet it's not that bad"  When I say it out loud it helps  Usually I do this when I am lying in bed and feeling sick  my anxiety gets bad at night because my mind can wander  
That's terrible  I had a bad experience with a line as well  Sometimes people just get into it for the wrong reasons  they don't have the compassion or other qualities you need to do a job like that well   sorry that happened to you  
Don't rely on women for happiness  It won't end well  
Re read     Stranger  from chill to pissy in 1 nanosecond   Like holy fuck  you need to make clarifications and walk on eggshells with fucking everyone   I don't see why people need to get worked up about meaningless things with strangers or people they actually know  It's like everyone acts like they demand to see a manager  I'm not perfect  but I'm not the problem if someone gets worked up over something simple because I didn't clarify that the green tea I'm drinking right now also has lemongrass in it 
Ok i understand what you mean    i will try to do what you suggested  Thank you very much 
You might try volunteering somewhere   like Habitat for Humanity or an animal shelter or something like that 
Hello  Im so very sorry you're going through this lately  But let me tell you  if you had an ulcer  which I do  you would know it beyond a doubt  It's hard to explain because people tell me all the time "Dont worry if you had     you'd KNOW it" even though we kind of already THINK WE DO  right   But rest assured if you had stomach cancer or an ulcer you would 100 percent know it    It sucks and is very obvious  When I get focused on just one worry  I tend to OVERFOCUS on that body part and notice every single sensation  So you might "think" you feel something but with an ulcer  I dont want to give you too many symptoms because you might start to worry yourself  you would know  I've never had one before in my life and when I started feeling this one it was like "Omg what IS THIS  It's driving me crazy it's so weird  it hurts and it feels so funny" yeah it's pretty obvious so please dont worry  You have no reason to be upset or scared  When you have an ulcer and you have stomach pains let me tell you  it's OBVIOUS  It's worse and you can't ignore it  If you can ignore your symptoms even for just a bit and they aren't really causing you significant pain or anything I would definitely say please dont worry  And I don't just mean stress  cause you can stress yourself silly  I just mean if you ACTUALLY feel something you've never felt before and you can't ignore it  That's how I found out about my ulcer  But even still im taking meds and they should be helping soon  So please dont worry  I hope you feel better love  I really hope that you can relax and feel better because I know health anxiety can really be the worst      3
Typically the sense of impending doom happens seconds or minutes before they die  You would have been dead if yours had anything to do with health issues  Just paranoia anxiety 
Thanks  Helps a lot  I'll try the YouTube stuff tonight  
I've been there  So many times  Just this week  actually  I was talking to my therapist about it today and there really is something to be said for throwing ourselves at breakneck speeds in work schedules so much that when we do get a day  or 7  that's unstructured  we go completely the other way and "waste" it   It's not a pleasant feeling  And I always wish I could at least have it back and use it to read or do something fun if I wasn't going to be otherwise productive anyway    But especially around the holidays and winter   It's not like sleeping is the antithesis of what our bodies need    Hang in there 
Noone can say  Shrooms might give you 1 week's remission  or 3 months  Or they wont work at all  Or ketamine will do it  Only way to find out is to experiment 
Someone on  r nootropics said a while back that there's four main things that we can say with confidence help to improve mood and general functioning  Those things are exercise  diet  sleep  and meditation  If you can get more of those things into your life you'll have a much better foundation from which to build on and improve your life   It sounds like you sleep well enough  though if you can get it so that you spend more time awake during the day  ie  get up at like 10am or earlier  you'll probably be better off  At the very least you'll get more of your Vitamin D naturally   If you can get an exercise   meditation routine going that would help  Start slow  Headspace  phone app  offers a free 10m guided meditation which might offer a good start    Diet definitely helps  Maybe you could try cooking up some recipes  If you like it you could become good at it  and maybe it could become a hobby  It's a good skill to have regardless  and it might help you feel more confident if you get good at it   I'd personally add another thing to the list  and that's herbal tea  Specifically  relaxing ones like chamomile  holy basil  valerian root  mint  There are others as well  These can really help me turn a day around  in that I might be a nervous wreck before and then pretty chill after drinking some tea  None of them will cure you  but they definitely won't hurt  And your body will definitely appreciate them  goes with diet to some degree   Lots of teas are good for you in other ways as well   You're only 22  so you have lots of time to figure it out  And your unique life experience actually gives you a unique perspective that may turn out to be pretty useful  It's good that you're getting fed up   you should be able to use that motivation to get better 
I have severe anxiety and I get that feeling pretty regularly when I have a panic attack  I've been to the ER countless times because I was convinced I was going to die  I've had my heart checked  and I'm completely fine  Being checked by a doctor might ease some of your fears  but it sounds like you have anxiety

Not really sure  but I have OCD  I think it's another type of anxiety disorder like GAD

There are some studies citing increased inflammation after exercise    https   www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles PMC3586919   https   www ncbi nlm nih gov pubmed 12690937  When I exercise too late in the day  I feel mentally obliterated until I fall asleep  Try switching the time of day you exercise and see if you feel any better 
Are you able to get an erection now  To be honest  if you can get an erection at this time  and it doesn't hurt I don't  think  you need to worry about any damage to your wingwang  Also  by obsessing over your possible visual changes can make them worse  Your brain is a powerful thing    I don't think you are in any immediate danger  The doctor will probably check your heart too    The best thing you can do right now is relax and stop reading horrible possible side effects on the internet   I know it's tempting but it is terrible for anxiety  Your doctor will diagnose any problems    Good luck   Source  not a doctor  used to be pre med tho

Yeah seriously  I mean  I'm over here dreading the idea this is an abscess and will get to my brain  but I couldn't imagine doing so without insurance
I've gone to therapy a couple of times now but it still makes me nervous 
I'm sorry this happened to you as well  I've been talking to my friends and some of them have had experiences like mine  I know it's not like getting professional help but it's a start I think    
Them calling you a slut is their way of justifying their horrible treatment of you  You were indeed raped and should contact authorities asap  And for what it's worth you've got the support of us on this sub  I hope you get all the help you need  
Thanks     
It has it's hits and misses  It's been on for a while so there is plenty of material to check out

Okay  I understand  If you feel that your life is better once you get life insurance  will you still go through with your plan 
I'm on 60mg of Cymbalta and crying is difficult  I was at 120mg for awhile and crying was impossible for me  That being said  I think everyone's experience is different  Lots of variables  
i don't know  I thought i had a heart attack on december 31st  but a friend of mine said he knows that feeling and he knows what a heart attack is because he had 2 yet with 31  and i told me that a heart attack don't come suddenly  Panic attacks are extreamly sudden    i don't have any idea how to get this through   i dont have the power to finish my apprenticeship and some other things 
I know how you're feeling  I've been there  You should be upfront and ask if you've been putting too much pressure on her  or if something was different if you two could fix it  You should also consider that she may be going through something hard and totally unrelated to you right now  Ask her how she's been  Good luck 
Thank you so much for this  3 Its currently 3am and I'm laying in bed feeling super anxious and then I remembered I posted this  I really hope giving a big "fuck you" to my anxiety will make me improve  I mixed up so many words yesterday and completely forgot whatever the costumers were talking about and what I even had to type at the computer  Bascially everything   I'm just hoping I'll get used to it very quickly so I don't fuck things up and have a good experience at work  Thank you again

Hey really appreciate that  Trying to keep busy and aiming to build a bigger circle of friends  I find when I'm out and with people I'm okay so the aim is to make friends this year  Need to start going back to the gym too  I feel that would help haha  And don't worry  he is a cunt lmao
Mantra sounds good to me I think I'll try that too    Thank you  3 
If you can concentrate on a book  i'd recommend reading  especially Tolkien or Dragonlance 
Thank you so much I really really hope I will get the hang of it      
I'm sorry for your loss  I can't even imagine how painful such a sudden death must be   Be patient with yourself in your mourning and healing  Treat yourself well   I'm sure your mother noticed your recent progress and she wants you to keep on that path as much as you can  Don't be afraid to ask for help  or space  or anything else you need right now 
Thank you  Good luck with school and in your sport    I know I'm not the only one  but I always feel that I am  I just can't seem to stop thinking about the bad things instead of the good  Plus  I keep thinking that every single athlete in the world was part of that crowd in high school besides me  
Call the police  Get help  Get tested for STDs  Tell your parents  You are not gross  ugly  fat or a slut and you are definitely not alone in this  We are here for you 
Yep I've tried the whole human support thing  and this is working out a whole lot better     
I agree 100 percent this has happened to me countless times with many visits to the er  thinking "IM DYING IM GOING TO DIE OH MY GOD" and having a panic attack  Yes 100 percent  This is very common OP  Very very common with health anxiety  
Horrible people did horrible things to you and they said horrible things  Go to the hospital  call the police  and don't listen to a word they said 
I've tried concentrating on books and that hasn't worked 
Oh  one thing to ask about is if your doctor uses anesthetic when inserting  Some do and some don't  I've never had kids and it was pretty okay without the anesthetic  but some people faint and have a lower pain tolerance  
Music is another good distraction  if you have any way to listen to some 
I'm not confident I could teach language to other people but maybe something I could do like offering private lessons  Teaching english abroad has been on my mind and it's basically the only thing I can think of that seems like I could enjoy right now  I just need to take the steps to move and actually get the job
I'm really glad it helped this has made my day so thank you  3    If you have any sons daughters they would be distraught to see you go as you would be a massive part of their lives  Your in my prayers  lt 3
Hi  Sorry to hear this  First  what my therapist said to me that when you have a panic attack you must try to breath deep and then normalize your breathing when you can  Also remember  panic attack is not going to kill you  It just feels like it and this is hard to remember at time cause it is so horrible when the panic strikes  You can also watch seconds running that can help you to calm down  sorry  I don't know how to say this better in english    Are you seeing any therapist  If not  you really should do it now  Healing progres is really slow but talking helps in long term  I hope you will feel better soon  You are not alone 
I can't sleep without watching something or listening to an audiobook myself  It's like this for a loong time 
Hey Patrick   First things first  you should go see your doctor  Could be your primary care provider  it doesn't need to be a therapist  But you definitely can be living a normal life  but not without helping yourself    Treatment doesn't always need to be through chemicals  Talk therapy is enough for many people    So  my advise is first thing in the morning before you go to work  pick up the phone and make an appointment   L2
The worst part is feeling discardable and disposable  I'm an emotional piggy bank to be drained then smashed once longer useful 
I know exactly how you feel  I'm the same  maybe we can help each other  how about a chat

Hi  Thank you  that helped   I don't know if I'm going to driving school or if I'm going to just drive with friends family  do they make "learning to drive" bumper stickers    but that's a really good tip    I love audiobooks and podcasts  and I think that might help too     Did you find that practice helped you become less nervous too  
Hello  I don't have much experience with bentonite clay  but I do think that if you look it up it's actually very commonly used as a face and body mask  which is probably why you did it and saw the videos     If many people do it very often  I would 1000 percent say you should not worry  In fact there are 100s of articles that explain why it's actually a good idea to use this clay  And if they have done it and nothing happened to them  lets be honest if it did  we would all be saying DO NOT USE THIS CLAY   STOP ITS CAUSED PROBLEMS AND LEAD POISONING    Also you are correct  If you immediately felt that way then it is DEFINITELY anxiety  This has happened to me too  For example if I try a new medication  I always think "What if im allergic  " and I freak out  I think "I shouldn't try it I mean I know I have to but I really am scared" then I take the medicine and guess what  Almost EVERY TIME no matter what the medicine I get dizzy and lightheaded and almost give myself a panic attack   Why is this  Because when we are worried about something we are about to do we pay even more attention to how we are feeling after we take it or use it  the clay mask  the medicine   So of course we notice EVERYTHING even things that aren't there  So you are very very right and smart to think that it was your anxiety   Also please remember that it probably has a very insignificant amount of lead in it  Back in the day people used lead for all kinds of things daily and eventually after years of exposure developed problems  If you use a mask with even just 2 percent of lead or something  it is not going to affect you  One time  I accidentally got bleach in my mouth  just a bit  I freaked out and called an emergency hotline and the woman told me even if I drank some the most it would do would be give me a stomach ache  Remember  if a lot of people are using this product  they are   and nothing has happened  then if you use it 1 time you are soooooo very unlikely to have ANY reaction whatsoever  So I would suggest throwing it away so that you don't scare yourself anymore  but just remember how often it's praised and suggested  It cannot hurt you and I promise you  you are fine   Sorry for the long reply I've just been in your shoes before     
This was not your fault  Please consider seeing a doctor  and speaking to someone   We are here  and we are listening 
Thanks for sharing  I relate to your post SO MUCH  It's a little different that it's not that I don't know how to do my job  but that some of my tasks are EXTREMELY detailed oriented and easy to fuck up on  When I make mistakes  especially on this project  they are somewhat public  visible to our constituency at least   Today  I spent most of the morning panicking and crying and double checking work on my day off  I totally  totally understand how you feel    One thing I finally did today after this post was call our employee assistance program  EAP   It is free and confidential and a case manager is supposed to get back to me for a referral to an outside counselor  I think I will get a few sessions free because it's through the program  I didn't have to tell them that my anxiety was work related  You could see if your job offers some type of benefit like that  or seek outside counseling    Also  I've been fantasizing about going back to working in retail like I did in college  so I get that desire  
Wow my friend  that's a lot going on at such a challenging age already  I feel for you and wish you the best   It sounds like you already know how alcohol is a serious problem  I encourage you to take serious action as soon as possible on that  Addiction is no joke  and the longer it goes on  the more and more challenging of a monster it will become  It's a show of courage to be able to reach out and get help if that's what you need   If you have an impulse to get away for a time  I think this could be a very helpful impulse  It could allow you to gain perspective and get away from stresses that drive you to drink  That would be my hope for you  that it offers a change of pace that helps you start healthy actions  Be careful though that it's not escapism though  simple avoidance of your problems    Hope that helps a little  And I hope you can find support in your life too  whether professionals or friends and family  Best of luck

I can't listen to music since I can't use my phone 
I understand  It can be very difficult to try to reach out to someone and talk  especially for those of us with depression  Do you have any friends that you talk to about your feelings  
   I do not have any grandparents  aunts  or uncles   You still probably have some second or third cousins   Your mom is an only child  and so is your dad 
Im a sophomore they were seniors we went to school together
I thought the same thing  but eh who cares if it's fake  It's better to just give advice for the situation and or move on with your life  It doesn't hurt anyone if they're making it up  and it could help someone in a similar situation who reads this 
That's not dumb at all   That actually made me laugh too haha

All I can picture is my sister doing this  She used to accidentally start fires with the microwave all the damn time lmao  
This feels like my life in a nutshell    I'm in love with someone whom I consider my best friend  I never told her because doing that can sometimes destroy the friendship in the process and I'd much rather keep her in my life for as long as possible    She recently told me she's pregnant and while there's a part of me that's happy for her  the rest of me feels as if I should slowly distant myself away from her  There lies the conflict  cause if I distance myself   She'll be gone  if I stay  she'll be here but not in the way I'd truly want her to be    I know it's selfish  But I'm lost   I'd thought I'd get over her but it feels impossible  
Ayy  I wanna help too 
Wow that's really messed up  No therapist should laugh at you  Maybe looking for a trauma specialist would be better if you try again  That's really terrible though  I'm so sorry to hear that 
lexapro will give similar feelings of numbness   i have no experience in taking it but i work in a pharmacy as a tech so theres that    
Haha I can relate so much  I am always the initiator of any text  If I don't then it's just back to loneliness town  
You didn't deserve this urgeless  My opinion of you is neutral however I don't enjoy your pain  I'm sorry  Oh and don't let  u Pizzachu1 drag you down because he wants everyone else to be as miserable as he is  As hopeless as he is  As utterly useless and unlikeable as he is  
ayy 2's good but 3's better  
I go through the same thing where I feel like most all people hate or don't like me  It's had me paralyzed from trying online dating because I know I'm just going to have constant rejection  But you didn't fall into the trap I did and that's amazing  You even found someone you've been talking to for a while  Though things aren't clear cut  I imagine you got to where you were by going with flow  You can try acknowledging there's a part of you that's hoping to protect you and see if it lets you have more control   It sounds like there are a lot of good things happening with a new start and new career  Maybe take a moment to enjoy it and don't slip down the path I did 
If you take lamictal be careful because the Mirena IUD changes your estrogen levels which changes the way your body absorbs lamictal  I didn't know this and it caused a lot of problems 
What a fun  impressive list      Your smile is awesome  I love it  I hope it stays on forever

Please see a therapist  It won't be an instant cure but it will be taking a positive step for your future  I'm sure your friend cares but probably feels unable or over her head  Don't write off therapists  if you find a good one they can help 
Definitely not alone  And from what it seems like  talking does help  That's the reason it's an irrational fear  even though we know it's stupid to obsess about death we're also curiously drawn to it    It's one of the main reasons I hate travelling overseas too  Even before my flights I'll comb through news reports for possible terrorist threats  and scare myself  I'm strangely attracted to those air crash investigations shows too  even though it makes me feel awful     maybe it's sort of a defensive mechanism   I hope you'll feel better soon and recover from your virus    
Teacher with anxiety here myself  A few things   1  Your first five years of teaching are tough  with the first year being the worst  It  does  get easier   2  Don't bring work home  Stay at school and do your grading there  I found bringing marking home always caused me anxiety   3  Find alternative ways of assessing  Not sure what you're teaching  grade subject   but there are online tools like Kahoot and Plickers that make life WAAAAY easier   4  Write mini goals for yourself  Make a check list and use it  It may even have steps broken down into smaller steps   5  Look into the Pomodoro method of getting done  When I'm feeling really anxious about a task  this approach really helps me    6  Is there any way the students could do some of the grading   7  Do you have a mentor teacher that can help you   8  Look at the TeachersPayTeachers website  It has a lot of lessons preplanned  Some are free  some are paid resources  The way I look at it is that my time is money and if I can spend a few bucks for something that will help with planning  it is worth it   9  Breathe  Remember to breathe    10  Be forgiving towards yourself  This is your first year teaching  Your admin knows this  Your colleagues know this  No one expects you to be perfect  And  it's okay to ask for help 
You know I have eaten all kinds of steak and not once have I thought about vCJD  And lets be honest  if you didn't know about vCJD you probably wouldn't have thought about it either    Please do not worry  300 cases   In total  Everywhere  Even just in the US alone  That is still a significantly low number  im talking about so very very low  There are 319 MILLION people in the us alone  and when I tried to calculate the percentage of people that is compared to everyone in the US  it literally gives me such a low  uncalculatable number  Were talking about the chances of you getting it being less than 0 00000000001  excuse my math im not that good but you get the idea   Also you'd have to eat the EXACT piece of the brain or spinal cord of the cow affected with mad cow disease in order to get the disease  Did that delicious steak seem like brain or spinal cord  That lessens your chances even FURTHER  vCJD is EXCRUTIATINGLY rare     Very very rare so please do not worry    I looked it up and sure enough getting struck by lightning has the same number of people affected as vCJD  Which means that your chances of getting mad cow disease for ANY YEAR not just in your entire life but any YEAR is 1 104 200 000 that is AN INSANELY low number  You do not need to worry  It's almost impossible  Just remember how rare it truly is  Feel better and eat that steak1
I get it  completely  I often get anxious and upset immediately after climax  I panic and burst into tears more often than I'd like to admit    Reading your post makes me feel more normal  tbh  I'm so sorry you're going through the same thing I am  but you aren't alone at all and I feel better knowing I'm not either  My boyfriend and I always talk through it  he's amazingly supportive  I'm happy yours is too  If he's as wonderful as he sounds  he probably wants you to talk about it  Let him be there for you  I know mine has helped me heal so much  All the best for you dear
Yes  Cutting back on alcohol will most certainly help your depression  Alcohol is a depressant  Yes people can get tipsy and wild and have fun on it  but the stimulant itself is a depressant    I am a child of an alcoholic  Thankfully  I never became one  but I do enjoy the craft of alcohol beer mead etc  My friend and I run a YouTube channel about beer  no I won't give it to you  and last year we exchanged advent calendars  I did a video every day about the different beer I had received  Three weeks in  I had a suicidal attack  I did not want to wake up  Some how I KNEW it was the alcohol consumption  Though I enjoy the craft of it  I didn't partake a lot of it  Yes  I have been drunk many times  But I have never wanted or felt the appeal of having a drink every night  From then on  I am very cautious about drinking  I still do  but not in the slightest like I did last year   The best thing for you is to go to AA  One day at a time  AA helps so much  You even get coins for reaching different milestones  if you're a gamer it's like a reward   I'm not saying you have to go cold turkey but it is often the best way  
Have you talked to adults or to the police  If not  do so now 
I totally do the same thing    end up putting important things off  like bills etc   because I don't want to pick up the phone  It does help  sometimes  to write down the conversation that I want to have 
Even in highschool  other people are a lot less hostile than most people think  Just be friendly and they will be friendly back 
You are not ugly or gross  These guys do NOT define your value  They are HORRIBLE people and they will get what they deserve  You need to go to the hospital  You need to tell your parents  I know your scared but rape IS NEVER the victims fault  EVER  Please please please understand you did not deserve this and it is not your fault  First just tell your parents a teacher sibling  anyone  
Not entirely unrelated  where does one find access to gymnast type equipment like the hanging rings etc nowadays  Maybe just university athletic departments I'm thinking 
I'm sorry that you feel so isolated  It must be really difficult to have such an unaccepting family   I can't really offer advice on improving your situation  I'm sorry that I can't offer much help   You can PM me if you want to talk about it

You ever tried joining a social therapy group  Or maybe join a meetup group that deals with some of your hobbies or interest  It seems like all you need is some positive exposure with people  You'll more than likely come to find you have a lot of common interest  especially since you have engineering expertise 
I'm on Lexapro now   I don't feel much in the way of side effects aside from low libido 
Good for you  It takes real strength to take that important step  Let us know how it goes with your doc 
I called the suicide hotline 4 days ago after failing and I got to explain how I felt which was nice but she focused more on trying to convince me to avoid same sex relationships because "they happen too fast and always fail"    Funny thing is that my feelings had NOTHING to do with any of that     also told me to get rid of my dog  I got to vent to someone which was nice but I dont think Im ever going to do that again  They're honestly a little useless  I'm sorry that they treated you that way  Completely fucked  
Hey  do you want to talk about it  You can PM me   Edit  Also  don't be sorry for making this post  It's understandable that you'd want to post somewhere about this and you don't deserve to feel any worse just for reaching out 
Here's my take OP   We all have certain times in our life where we feel completely trapped   Anything would be better than the current situation   But at the same time it's hard to think about consequences clearly because emotions can cause strong reactions   For you  it's likely that things have not gone well so far  and you feel that you can't fix the situation and make yourself comfortable   The problem is that you're at one of those crucial crossroads   Sure  you can go back to college  but you're there right now   It doesn't get any closer to higher education and an easier life   You have to remember that a situation change doesn't automatically lift the psychological root problems   They're stopped for a bit  but it doesn't take much to land yourself into another trap   If anything  a job is not freeing  especially ones where you have no degree or experience   The jobs you will end up finding are likely going to exasperate you in the same ways   If you do somehow find a no stress job it'll likely be something janitorial   There are very few low level jobs that aren't physically socially demanding in some way   I wanted to do janitorial for similar reasons  but I believed I was in a situation where it was OK   For you  you have the possibility to finish your degree  find a job that suits you  and you will look back on all of this struggle in a positive way   No one remembers all of the shitty anxious moments  moreso the best moments of that period of time when they look back years later   There's nothing wrong with going into class one day and just being a different person   You don't have to hold the weight of previous encounters and conversations in such a high degree   Class work is stressful  but being organized with it can do wonders   Really  it's more about calming your mind  realizing that every moment you're alive is the moment where good things happen  to change you need to accept your surroundings   This is your life   You're an adult   You will make these decisions regardless of what I say   I just think that you need to see the situation without your stress attached   I hope everything works out 
Just seeing your response  so checking in     How are things now  
Lots of young people have a hard time with this  Do you have a therapist  Are there any types of jobs that interest you 
I'm at a all time low today  I have a lot of anxiety and depression about my bad oral hygiene  I hadn't taken care of my teeth because of my depression and I have depression because I haven't taken care of my teeth    I barely got out of bed today and have felt shitty all day  I lost the only person I could talk to about this stuff years ago to cancer  my dad    I'm not sure how to cope with all that or I just don't  I don't know 
I thought about this too after eating beef a few weeks ago  Googled it and found out that getting mad cow disease especially in the USA is impossibly rare  And it doesn't show up for years anyway after exposure  So if you're feeling funny after eating beef  it's not from mad cow 
It's  definitely    absolutely     not your fault     Go to the hospital now to get a rape kit done  Really  go now    Please get help  You are worth so much more than these creeps  You really are 
Hey buddy  I've been dealing with depression and quite bad anxiety for years too  There are a whole load of ways to deal with general anxiety  my go to is very relaxing music compilations on youtube  with an ad blocker   Music isn't great at calming me down  but if i make sure to keep it on  it helps to stop the prevent anxiety building to intolerable levels  I'd go on  but one piece of advice at a time  Give  this one  https   www youtube com watch v 5gfhv0iCfmw  a try  it's my favourite 
Jesus Christ bro  that's extra heavy  Thank you so much for the long reply and sharing your story  I'm really glad you haven't had any attacks in over a year  good for you man  I totally understand what you're saying when you say that something isn't quite "right " That's how I currently feel right now  It's an extremely off putting and bothersome feeling  It's strangely dissociative  I do not feel quite like myself  I really hope with time this gets better for both myself and for you  Best of luck man  have a nice night  
2 years sober  It has being tough  and of course it did not magically solve my problems  I still deal with depression bipolar disorder  but if I had not stop drinking I would probably would not have a job  managed to leave the horrible neighborhood where I lived or finally have one semester left to graduate   Stop drinking  You can do it and it will help  If you cannot do it alone  don't feel bad  just look for help  Keep going  try your best and don't give up 
I was excited for the holidays because I met someone in August and I thought  "hooray  I have a girlfriend to spend the holidays with" and you know what  She ruined Thanksgiving  broke up with me   Christmas  she was alone and blamed me because I had to spend the day with my family   and New Years  refused to spend the day with me because she was upset     To top it off  I've been dealing so much with her manic depressive tirades  that I've let my work decline and I may end up losing my job in April if I don't get my act together   Luckily  today she suggested we "take a break" and when I agreed  she blew up and told me to never contact her again  My life is teetering on the verge of total annihilation and all I wish is I'd been able to spend the holidays alone    So  I say good for you for being strong and getting through it  They're over for another year at least

Hey there  I'm not sure I have the answer for you but I wanted to comment because I feel like we have some things in common  I also dropped out in 10th grade as a result of some kind of situation at the time  and generally skipped school more often than I ever went  I remember feeling pretty bad  too  I spent the following couple of years doing nothing but playing World of Warcraft and watching anime   I also know how it feels to have art be my only income  and generally how it just isn't enough  Do you mind if I ask what kind of art you do 
No reason not to go see it on your own  Watching movies isn't really a group activity anyway  since you just sit there looking at a screen and not talking for two hours  It's a great movie on the big screen  And it's good to try to do things by yourself to get more comfortable with it so it doesn't bother you so much     All of that is beside your underlying point though  wanting to go with friends and feeling lonely really sucks  I'm sorry   
Ah  my bad  Yeah I completely agree with you  People like that are serious asses 
Its all about baby steps  If a baby step works out you get a bit of confidence  if a baby step goes wrong its only a little thing  Its like going to a casino and only betting a small amount each time  less risk   Gl

I don't know why   I'm just sad  For the most part I was successful at some things  I cooked twice and ate  I took a shower  Went to the store  Kind of cleaned  It's more than I usually do when I'm down  But all day I just feel the darkness coming around the edges  My chest hurts  Luckily the meds keep the worst away  But it will go away  I guess  Feel very down  I just feel lonely    My breakup made me realize I lost a chunk of friends  That they would rather hang out with a drug addict who mentally and emotionally abused me for a year and then basically left me broke  I went through this horribly difficult and painful and end the end violent break up with someone and didn't have anyone there on my side  I never got to mourn anything or was able to cry it out of be consoled      I'm sad because I'm lonely that I'm single  I haven't been alone in three years  Being me again is a priority but I just feel like a shell  I spent New Year's Eve with only a couple people I'm friends with and completely just couldn't do it  Headache  stomachache and then the social anxiety of being out which I haven't felt in so long    I hate that I went right into jumping into talking to a new guy  as if I don't trust myself to be alone anymore  But I feel like a fake  He likes someone who doesn't exist  I feel like I don't even exist

I completely understand  brother  I wish I was a different person in a different universe  and I think of how happy I could be then  which always makes me smile in the real world  But after a minute or two  I come back to my senses and realise I'm smiling for no reason weirdly in public 
Hey  I'm sorry you feel like your progress in life has stagnated   If you feel like you'd enjoy voice acting  I'd say that you should give it a shot  I understand that it's difficult to take a chance and risk failing  but if you're already thinking about suicide then I'd go for it  There isn't much harm in trying  right  And it might give you a purpose in life  because it's something you're really passionate about   By the way  that's a really cool occupation  
I'm so sorry to hear that  Anyone who tells you to "man up" is an ignorant bigot undeserving of your attention   Are you receiving any psychological help at all  Maybe therapy  or if you're willing to give meds another shot  perhaps there's some that you haven't tried yet   Hold on  friend 
I wouldn't think that's "normal" per se  but it happens  SSRI class drugs can sometimes trigger manic episodes in people who are bipolar and don't know it yet  have only had the depressive part   and mania isn't always feeling super duper happy  it can be dysphoric too  Or maybe Prozac just didn't agree with your particular brain  It would be worth talking about with your doc  especially if you are ever talking about trying a different medication  that kind of reaction would be important info 
Taking curcumin with Bromelain improves its uptake  
Greetings  Please don't let my name scare you 
What's your new years resolution  
My suggestion to you is to change your scenery  If you are in two dead end jobs why not just move  Google around for voice actors  who is your favorite by the way   and emulate them  Fake it until you make it is a real thing but you need to have someone to emulate  Voice acting is largely remote from what little I know so it could be done from where you are if you don't want to move  Also take up a physical hobby  The endorphins from exercise are very good for you and a great mood booster  Getting in shape will always make you attractive to people as well  Whatever you do be passionate about it and smile  People will gravitate to you as they always want to be happy as well  I wish you the best of luck in 2017 OP  I'm pulling for you   
I'm glad to hear  Stay strong   D
Do the parents know that she has these medically diagnosed conditions  Depressed people can be really good at hiding or minimizing these things and that leaves the parents not knowing the reasons for behavior

Now is forever  If you exist at all  then you've already existed forever  Mind derived time is temporary  Being is beyond mental constructs  Mind seeks meaning  mind seeks to find "a point to life"   This thought action is the mind going in circles  From the point of view of the mind it is pointless to search for a point  Yet of course that's not really true either  There is no meaning nor meaninglessness  
If you need an ear  I can listen
Finally the holiday season is over  I don't have to pretend that I am happy anymore 
I think having a pet is  always  a great idea  but I hope you do get that dog at some point  even if not now 
Mmm I don't know what to comment  Your feelings are very understandable if I was in your situation I don't think I could do better

Awwww  Sounds like you have a grumpy one  I promise all the cats I've had have at least not hissed at me  Dogs are generally good tempered but cats get a bad reputation because of the ones that get real cranky
There's different levels of SA  I'd say I'm in a similar boat  I much prefer one on ones than anything with more than 3 people   One thing that I try to keep in mind is that language naturally puts constraints on the way we think  and it seems appropriate to mention it here  "Social anxiety" tends to have an encompassing label when we hear the words  but really everyone has it to some degree 
I think you just discovered Existentialism    So go ahead and decide for yourself what life is about 
Do you think people in an alternate world dream about being us 
Sometimes it really is chemical  My psychiatrist has worked wonders 
Ooh  yeah  seroquel is nasty stuff  S
Hey bud  I've gone through something similar to that and the best thing to help me out was to just get out of my comfort zone  I know hanging out with people doesnt seem like something you want to do but take the time of isolation to figure out what makes them your friends  whether it be from childhood or not  Find the reason why they're apart of your life and think of that reason next time they ask you to hang out  You let them into your life for a reason and vice versa  They want to see you buddy  If you make it a habit of not seeing your friends then you might not want to see them once that feeling you have passes  I wish you the best  friend     Edit  comma

Yeah that's a bummer  Things only get more awkward when you try to force yourself to talk either  I'm not trying to make light of your situation  but it's too bad they can't let you be the quiet friend like Silent Bob  
Traveling alone is awesome  You get to do whatever YOU want to do at whatever pace you want  If you stay in hostels with other travelers  people are always up for going out to eat  or going sightseeing together  Or you can decline and do those things by yourself    I like traveling with others  but I also enjoy being alone    So traveling by myself works out  
I used to drink most nights and at one point  I was drinking a bottle of wine a night  I would stop for a while and I would feel marginally better  When I would drink  I would always wake up feeling despondent the following day  I didn't have that feeling when I stopped drinking  but I still felt "depressed " It's like gradations of grey scale  Physically  I was sleeping better and losing weight from not drinking extra calories  Emotionally  I felt only slightly better  nothing really to write home about   This past November  I bit the bullet and asked my doctor for help with my depression  I was at such a low ebb  I really wanted to shuffle off this mortal coil  but I have a kid and I can't do that to him  I stopped taking anti depressants almost two decades ago  because they only seemed to work briefly  I got tired of the side effects and messing around with different combinations doages  I have been white knuckling it since then and I think that's how I got into heavy drinking  It was taking the edge off of the depression in that moment  but the price was a rebounding  soul crushing depression in the morning   I am not telling you or suggesting you do this  I am just providing my experiences  I started taking this anti depressant and within 3 weeks my cravings for booze went away and I felt like life sucked a little less  I am feeling better  bit by bit  I don't dread getting up in the morning and I don't sit around in my pajamas until 4 PM anymore  I think because I am no longer severely depressed  I no longer need to seek relief through a glass or three of Pino Grigio   I do want to point out  I didn't take the anti depressant to quit drinking  it was from a desperate desire to stop feeling like shit  The reduction in booze cravings was a bonus  I was basically drinking to blunt the depression    From your post  I feel like you are in a similar place where I have been  I know it's a shitty place to be and shitty cycle to be trapped in  I hope you will explore this further with your therapist  because it's honestly no way to go through life  Take care   3
Damn  this describes the dynamic of every single friend group I've had  Unfortunately I don't have any friends now  so maybe I got too awkward and sad for anyone to want to be friends with me  
They know  they just think its all a bunch of bs
Hi there  sorry to hear that you have had such a bad sexual experience at such a young age  It sounded to me at first like you 3 got drunk together and one thing led to another  but their attitude afterward and particularly the rough treatment during the sex makes me think it was definitely something they may have planned    I know it's hard at the moment  but try to remember that they have called you those hateful things because they are either ashamed of themselves  as they should be  or are just wretched human beings  A visit to the police might not be a bad idea as others have suggested  as that will at the very least get those 2 on their radar in case this happens to anyone else    Regarding the slut thing  As a guy  33 now  I have always hated the term  and  particularly that it is directed mainly toward women  There is no such thing as a slut  Boys like sex  girls like sex  That's the end of it  They're just trying to make you internalise and feel bad in yourself so you may not point the finger at them   Finally   I would see a doctor about your injury  always a good idea  Don't be nervous or embarrassed about it   doctors see much worse  It will be good peace of mind that you are fine  rather than stressing and not knowing  
The only way you could know if you have depression is to go to therapy  I encourage you to do It 
I think you might have misinterpreted the situation  they might have just said what they were saying in a tone of voice that made it seem like they were angry even though they weren't 
Something I want to say  high school doesn't matter  Now I'm not saying to drop out  not by any means  what I am saying though is that once you're out you'll see how the world really works  especially when you get a job   Literally every job I've had  4  the coworkers have been really nice  they care about your work ethic more than your awkwardness  And if you have a good work ethic people will naturally want to talk to you  Trust me on this one man  I'm not the first to say it but there's a  lot  more to life than high school 
Same thing keeps happening to be with concerts  I'm the only one of my friends that enjoy jumping around in the mosh pits and screaming my lungs singing along with the band    It sucks being that guy  I would suggest working out a routine to when this happens again  I don't even ask them anymore with I have a concert  I go an hour before to get a good space and stack up with red bull and food for the line and a lighter just in case someone needs it  I don't smoke

I'm on Mirena and haven't had a period since getting it inserted  Could be the IUD or could be the AP I've been taking  My mood has had no change though 
Same for me  People only interacted with the "real me" if they needed something out of me like good grade etc  Whenever I wanted someone to like me I always had to adapt this personality that I thought they might like  its so frustrating  As for suicide I am also kind of in the same situation as you are  I don't have any siblings but my parents always pressure me to succeeded to fulfill their dreams  they never care about what I want or what I have to say    You can PM me whenever you want  I don't mind  I am very new at Reddit so I am still getting used to its mechanics  
You're welcome  good luck with everything 
Yes  I am angered at the fact that they took it so lightly in prescribing it  to someone so young  and without a diagnosis 
Some of the greatest people in history had their vices  Some of those great people even dealt with mental illness   Issac Newton suffered from bipolar disorder and depression  so did Edgar Allen Poe   Yet  they became inspirations for generations to come   If anything  their mental hangups were what pushed them to become successful   Their problems only made them stronger  One day  you'll probably be an inspiration for people like us  Your appetite for success is contagious   because I want to be successful too 
I used to do this  nowadays I'll purposely look like an idiot and have fun doing it  It's almost a fail safe  if I ever do look back on my stupidity it was all in good fun anyway   My fingers are crossed for you too man  best of luck to you 
I've been rolling around in this existential muck for years now  I suppose this post of mine is a breakdown of what it meant to me   Life is still meaningless to me   
29yr old female  ptsd   major depression  and anxiety paranoia  After trying almost every ssri out there they finally tried Lamictal at 100mg and its pretty good  but what really made me go up was adding 150mg of effexor xr  ssnri    5mg of Zyprexa and 2mg of prazosin  I  would be dead without my meds by now  The effexor killed my Sex drive at first but it's slowly coming back   The Zyprexa really helped with my paranoia with almost no side effects  The prazosin is what I call my miracle drug  it kills my nightmares so I can sleep restful for the most part   I started on a low dose of Lamictal  and when they raised it I got a horrible rash  apparently that can be either a deadly rash or a simple hive like reaction  it doesn't happen anymore thankfully but they say I'm at my max dose for it 
It's very rare  but stress ulcers do exist  You are far more likely at 22 years old to have a ulcer than stomach cancer  Stress ulcers can also be called gastritis  Anyways  listen to your doctor  Work with him or her with a plan of action  Quit the alcohol  spicy food  fatty food  caffeine and smoking  Start meditating or some other relaxation stuff and eat stuff that soothes your insides    Good luck  Stomach issues sucks  But again  stomach cancer at your age is super rare  You will be fine

This post spiked my anxiety big time too 
The Mirena releases a very small amount of a progestin  and the majority of women who use it experience their usual hormone cycles after they've had it for a little while    Here's a detailed breakdown on how an IUD and other forms of birth control vary in terms of how they affect hormones    https   www bedsider org features 317 all about hormones
I've known I was going to be a pathetic  friendless loser since I was a little kid  and I still can't get over it  You'd think I'd be used to the idea by now  that it wouldn't hurt so much when I saw happy young people out on dates or just hanging out with all their friends  but it's still devastating  If there's one thing I hate more than anything else about being human  it's the engrained need for contact with other humans  Obviously it's a wonderful thing for a lot of people  but it's a curse for people like me  like us  people who weren't socially conditioned in a healthy manner when they were kids  
How is 'now' related to 'forever'   Pointless to search for a point because there is none objectively  therefore meaningless 
I mean  if you take it to that extreme  I believe the term for that would be mania or hypomania   I agree though   A healthy human does not sit at the polar opposite of the spectrum in terms of depression  they're more in the middle  if that makes any sense     
My anxiety gets worse around nighttime  Do you have access to a computer  If so  I'd say turn on something light to watch like videos from YouTube or Netflix if you have it  If not  there's two options  journaling and meditating  Write down what you're anxious about and why  but make sure to keep these notes positive  That's crucial to help make sense in your mind that everything will be ok  which is the truth  Then try meditating  It's not a difficult process  Since you can't use your phone for a meditating app  just try to focus on laying down  Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth for a little while  then return to normal breathing  After that  listen to the sounds where you are and focus on how your body feels  Then count your breaths while feeling your stomach rise and fall  and then open your eyes after a few minutes of that  Hopefully something will help 
Holy shit man  you're a fucking wizard  What did you say when you did start talking to her  You must have been bricking it on that first date 
I had a paraguard copper IUD for 4 years  If it's covered by insurance or inexpensive for some reason  I think it's worth trying since it can be extremely effective and worry free   I think sometimes our brains latch on to what we hear  so I'm hesitant to explain my negative experiences  But since you're asking  I think my body slowly  and then rapidly  rejected the IUD  My cramps were so intense I was asking friends for leftover opiates even though they make me kinda sick  I started getting BV which had never been an issue  and my resulting self consciousness ruined my sex drive  My OB Gyn said he'd had several patients start having problems after a year or two and decide to get it out    In the last few months before I had it removed it felt as if something was very  very wrong that I had trouble pinpointing    my anxiety was flying high all the time  about everything  and I had strong feelings of wanting "this thing" out of my body  I'm very much a skeptic and had zero qualms with the IUD going into it  I was so excited to get it  actually   but I became so physically and psychologically uncomfortable that I was scouring forum after forum on copper IUD's and found hundreds of women who had bad reactions similar to mine  You might say these were not reliable sources necessarily  but I felt so strongly something was very wrong and they matched up well to my experience  The only scientific study I found was one that found copper levels were too high in women after a year of use  But that was only one small study      then again who will fund further studies on the negative effects of such reliable birth control    I can dig it up if you're curious   Personally I think the recent craze over IUD's isn't representative of the many women whose bodies react poorly to them  I'm not saying don't try it   if costs are low  it's totally worth seeing if it works for you  But I personally wouldn't recommend someone drop  500  1000 on one  And if you're feeling uncomfortable  don't hesitate to remove it  I felt so much better once I did     Edit  I also went from 3 day walk in the park periods to 5 6 days of murder scenes  But that part was worth it to me  It was the pain  anxiety  malaise  and BV that pushed me to have it removed  Also important  my best friend LOVES paraguard and has no extra pain or other issues       Edit 2  just fyi I'm very sensitive to both pain and hormones   My best friend who loves paraguard is sensitive to hormones but not pain   
Fuck  
I appreciate you replying  I also spent most of my time after dropping out on the internet and watching anime   I'm an adult oriented artist digital artist  Mostly work through furaffinity  I really enjoy it but also its so hard when in between commissions and building a follower base   What about you 
    Ayy but that poem was nice  mister or miss   Just wanted to let you know that   
Would be awesome
One thing I want to add is that our language  and really all languages  constrain the way we think  words are finite when life is anything but  "Social anxiety" has such a strong connotation to it  personally I try not to think how 'bad' my SA is and in turn it almost goes away completely   There's a great book that helped me a lot when I first realized I had SA  it's called "The Wisdom of Insecurity" by Alan Watts  He talks about this for a chapter  I recommend it to anyone who wants to improve themselves 
Does anyone really have a friend like that though 
If that's not rape then I don't know what is  Go to the police asap  Don't let them get away with this or they might do it someone else  
Could you try writing it down and giving it to them 
Thank you for your support   I greatly appreciate it   I just   I'm terrified that If I do nothing this guy   this opportunity will slip between my fingers   I know it's ridiculous of me to think that   I do not have unilateral control over the events of my life   But that's how it feels   I want to contact him again     But even doing that makes me scared 
It's completely understandable that you fear rejection  this doesn't make you a loser   I guarantee that you aren't nearly as bad as you see yourself  You are more critical of yourself than anyone else  If you have some form of depression  your thoughts become even more irrational and you see yourself in ways that no one else does  Just remember your perception isn't clear  and it's causing you to see yourself as worse than you really are   I'm sorry for your pain   3

Where do you live  Sorry to be so personal  but here in Northern Europe 'cold and disinterested' is the norm and much more acceptable  than friendlier climates   Perhaps you'd do better with people more like yourself 
I don't know where you're from  but I'm from Canada  I've known a lot of guys who have gotten into various professional hockey levels  and it's really not all it's supposed to be  They say once you're in it  it becomes a job just like any other  There's a lot of pressure and stress  Your job performance is always in question  and if you don't want to lose your slot  you have to be working constantly and sacrifice every other part of your life in order to make it work   If you really love sport  use it as your refuge   Everything else is shit  don't drag the complicated shit into the thing you love   As for what to do with the rest of your life  people in your and my age group are expected to change careers eight times in our lives  Not just jobs  but whole sectors of employment  The 40 year factory job doesn't exist anymore  there's only the hustle  When I was thinking about my future  I did an exercise  I just took a piece of paper and tried to figure out what I was good at  I have really terrible self esteem  so this was really hard for me  I eventually had to start asking people for help finding the good things about myself  Then I looked for interesting problems that matched my skill set  Maybe your friends and family  or someone else can help you with a similar exercise  And remember  you won't be stuck in a 40 year job ever  because they don't exist anymore  If you don't like a career  build knowledge on the side and move on  You're not chained to a wall or anything like that   
don't ever try to impress anyone but yourself 
I havent got a reccomendations for an app if you are looking for it  But i have my own reward systems  It involves popsicles for the smaller tasks like vacuuming and it involves lazy days for the days after my quarterly spring winter autumn summer cleaning  
I just say "Good " I don't think it's inaccurate to say it's just a way of saying Hello that has the illusion of being friendlier or more informal  The expectation is that everyone involved says they are "Good "
Do this all the time  I'm the complete opposite person of who I really am  
Thank you so much for your reply  I'm so glad I found this sub  it's like I've finally found a group of people who understand  I cannot tell you how much your comment helped me  No matter how many times I reassure myself that I'm overreacting and that it's just anxiety  it means so much more hearing from another person that I'm not crazy  I totally related to everything you said  my first thought was that I was allergic to the clay and I would react the same way if I got bleach in my mouth  And you're right 1000   the chance that I got lead poisoning from the one time use of a product that tons of people use everyday is highly unlikely  Just needed to hear it from someone else  Thank you so much 
Thank you for sharing your story  Someday we will all be okay  
I wish I could give you a hug  I know how you feel  Just breathe  All you can do is breathe  
That sounds familiar  Was it in a book 
I'm here if you want to talk  Send me a pm whenever you like 
from your description it sounds like they had sex with you against your will  which is rape absolutely  I'm sorry that happened to you  nobody deserves that  
Tell me what movie you are going to watch  I have no friends either lol  I'll go watch it too so it's like you have a friend with you    
I don't mean to be rude  but it's very different for awkward girls  Most guys find that kind of behavior cute and it's not going to effect their opinion of you  On the other hand  awkward guys are absolutely not cute and are actually repulsive to the majority of females  Very awkward guys are basically fucked when it comes to romance  
Haha  I do the same  I dunno  I just felt like it was likely we may be from the same part of the internet  How bout that  I wonder if we've even stumbled across each other before 
To me  the holiday season is over  and it's time for me to pretend that I am happy again
Hi OP  you did nothing wrong  If you have anyone in your life you can talk to  please do  If not  you can talk to me  
At least something makes you happy
Fuck them 
  It's the attitude we need to change and accept that we should say fuck the rest of them  I'm not there yet but it's true  You're just as important as everyone that makes you feel bad  We're possibly the only intelligent life in the universe and we're only here for an insanely insignificant amount of time  I just wish some of us weren't cursed with stupid brains that make everything seem impossible   Bro  you are my spirit animal    Sorry   for   not   posting   something   helpful 
Nice job  Cheering you on from the USA 
I think 300 cases in the US for sCJD and like 4 for vCJD  but it still has me shooken up  whatever I found in my food was probably dime sized  kinda hard and white  not sure if it was gristle but it still has me worried  I try to look at things from a statistical stand point but its so hard to not think negative thoughts on this
Ehh  thats normal to a large degree for some folks  You have Reddit and it's 24 7    So how was your day 
They should be  by the state  
Everything will work yourself itself out you just got to get out of your comfort zone more  About feeling like your the only one who hasn't done a lot of stuff plenty of people are in similiar places and you would never know  I actually almost dated a girl that's a sophomore at my school who had never dated anyone  You never know and even if they have done other stuff as long as they get along with you they will most likely not give a shit and if they do then they aren't worth your time  College university gives you opportunities to fix your anxiety you just got to use them 
The thing with friends    I feel like it can get really easy to rely too much on them for emotional support solutions  They're just people too  you know  I also know that when someone is in an especially bad depressive episode  there is really no talking them out of it  That's   hard for our friends  too  Somewhere  there has to be a balance between things   I hope you can repair this important friendship  Remember you need to consider what they may be going through and what got them here 
While it is true that there are certain things you could have done differently that would've not let this happen  it doesn't mean that it is your fault  It does not excuse him from going against your will  Even if he was drunk  you said NO  He was the one who didn't listen  He is the one at fault  not you 
Additionally  you're following me around from a conversation about abortion from several days ago   Grow up  this isn't the sub for it  Saying someone deserved being molested is fucked up 
Eventually I run out of things to browse     Reddit is my getaway most of the time when I'm feeling down and alone My day was okay  I'm alive    how about yours  
Sex drive went way down for the first year  Appetite through the roof for the first year  Both stabilized themselves for the most part  although I still suspect that both are out of whack still   
Best of luck to you in the new year  and congrats on finishing school and getting your own place   Those are both huge achievements  especially when you considered your OCD to be completely unmanageable only a few years ago  Glad that you're doing better   
Thank you  As unfortunate as it is  I am glad to see other people know what I'm talking about because it's more than just flashbacks   it's that awful  terrible feeling after orgasm  I think I posted this half for some advice and half to see if anyone else in the world knew what I was talking about  So thank you for your words 
Yeah I don't feel sad just tired and foggy 
I'm kind of in the same boat  I'm 21 and I really just don't want a future anymore  I hate life and I would gladly end it  but I also don't want to put my family through that  Im kind of mad that I can't just end it  because living is unbearable anymore  but I don't want to pass the pain onto anyone else  it's tough  and I'm sorry I don't have any advice  but hang in there man  
I love that I'm allergic to dogs and cats  I'd love to have a reptile or rats but I'm not allowed to have those either under my dad's rule  despite me even paying some rent   Suffering 
 hug  how are u doing 
I feel like asides from being awkward  looks have a lot to do with it I'm not good looking  therefore many people don't really look to talk to me whatsoever  In turn  I just get more and more awkward with time

Yeah  I hear you  The important thing for me was to take lots of long walks with a notepad  think  and then write down the things that were important to me  After I was diagnosed  I read a lot of philosophy  mostly the classics and mostly ethics   I got some nuggets that I keep  They're good to have on the good days  but my shitty days are still shit  Life without meaning is    meaningless  Maybe it's more precise to say purpose  I dunno  If you're into reading dense stuff  you could pick up some philosophy books  They can be surprisingly cheap  Dover Thrift Editions usually less than 5 bucks  I'd recommend Epicurus  Marcus Aurelius  and J S  Mill  but those are just what resonated with me 
My concern   when she's on a regular schedule  primarily working  she does great   On days off   between jobs  she falls into sleeping all day and Netflix binging   Despite having lots of things she would like to work on  she's not motivated to start them on her own   And without sounding like I'm nagging her  I'm not sure how to encourage her to make use of the time she has available to accomplish her goals   However  what I also know is that the blows to her self esteem when she loses a job are crushing   And if she had disability  perhaps she'd be able to pursue volunteering in some of the creative fields she loves     Thanks for the input   
The craziest thing is  in all the successful relationships i know  the guy cheated on the female but they still have way more successful of a relationship than i ever will 
I'm so sorry this happened  It's very disappointing to look forward to a therapy appointment and finally vent what you've been holding in and then that opportunity gets taken away from you  I would suggest writing down everything you want to talk about on paper  not only to get it out of you like you might have in therapy  without input back   but as a reminder to discuss these things at your next appointment  Best wishes  
thanks    this helped a lot  Looks like I should to CBT first to build a foundation and then attempt DBT next 
Thank you   
I feel you  I've been there  in my own way  I think the first step is to figure out why you're terrified of being vulnerable   I've had my own battles with pride and being unwilling to ask for help  or to receive it when offered  I thought long and hard about it  and ultimately I believe I'm just like this because I wasn't raised in an environment that was safe enough to be vulnerable in  So  it's just what immediately comes natural for me  Now that I know that  maybe I can make the steps to feel more comfortable about vulnerability  too 
You should go to the hospital and tell them what happened  What someone else does to you is not your fault

Same  it really sucks being alone  If you want we can talk about it  Message me in pms if you want 
Try to eat something healthy at least sometimes  I go too long without food too  and man  You just feel a difference  You won't get better if you don't eat   Hell  today I sat and thought that it would be too much work to make any food  Too expensive to order delivery  I'll just not eat today  But   I managed to toss some carrots and potatoes into boiling water and at least had that much  I'm glad that I did

Hey there  You sound to be making a lot of progress with your anxiety issues  I too live outside Philadelphia and have dealt with anxiety issues since childhood that have reemerged and worsened since I started and now finished college  Just starting to frequent this sub  I'm also a massive Star Wars fan  Did you enjoy R1  Best of luck to you 
Please consider that he is probably doing this to other girls   I understand about not wanting everyone to know about it but maybe you can find another way to "tell"   Maybe write an anonymous letter to his boss or to the police so there will be some suspicions raised and maybe someone will notice something is "off"   Edit   Forgot to say you're very brave for writing out what happened     I hope you find healing and able to receive the right kind of care   What he did was HIS fault   There's no shame in anything you've done and if you never report him I don't blame you for that either  
What time did you have to get to times sq for NYE  
So post here  Plenty of folks listening  It helps to vent sometimes 
I've lived in the DC area for my entire life  including uni  As a Black second gen immigrant  I have to be extra vigilant re  safety  Classes are cancelled on inauguration day  so I plan to stay in my dorm room  which is a confirmed bigot free zone  Inaugurations are always hectic here but this one will be just too much  
I like to drink ginger ale when I have an upset stomach  especially hangovers  The ginger helps  and the carbonation does  too 
This sounds like rape  You need to see a doctor 
That sounds like a very good experience   I spent this NYE with a bunch of friends and strangers  I have never had more fun in my life   It certainly beats last year when I waited to see the fire works through the bedroom window and fell asleep  Ditto the year before   I'm spending 6 months traveling across the US and reconnecting with old friends now  This is partially to force myself to completely get rid of my sa 
congrats  small steps at a time will turn into bigger accomplishments 
People make it seem so crazy that someone that went through the things that you have dont want to be vulnerable  Ever see a abused dog try to bite the crap out of someones hand thats trying to help  Hope seems lost  You have that coice in your head telling you that you can get through this  Listen to that  Listen to your heart  I feel that you keep going to bad relationships is because thats what seems normal to you  That sucks but you gotta see the other side of things  Busting your ass trying to see the light in the experiences you've been in is incredible  Keep doing that and im sure one day its going to pay off  You're not letting life kill you as much as it showed in the past it wants to  You're  a strong human being  Keep it up bud  
the worst is when driving I notice my hands are super sweaty then I get anxious about my ability to handle the wheel in an emergency situation  
Just because you took the time to respond to my post and listen to me  I just want to say that you helped me a lot  Something about you being a perfect stranger and all  is what I needed  hope you had a happy holidays and I'll pray you have a good 2017  posting this now because my family went to the airport today and i'm free from the danger of conflict
Okay  If you're going to do that can you talk to me first  
thank you so much  i honestly really appreciate displays of empathy even if they are online  It means a lot 
I wish you all the best and if you ever need to talk I'm here for you   
Although I want to have someone to talk to I just don't have a clue what to talk about with them  To me that's the most frustrating part and why I can't keep in contact with people 
No problem man  sometimes you need to make light in a bad situation

Dude  you're 23  You're not supposed to have life all figured out yet  Actually  flipping from interest to interest could turn out to be a good thing  figuring out what you like and don't like  All the grownups who seem like they have their shit together  Sham artists  the lot of them  There's no magical plateau of completeness where everything is fine and dandy  You're not behind  The only person you should ever compare is past you  Everyone has to move at their own pace  People like us just do it with heavy weights  Some people have the weights on for a bit  then they can take them off  Other people wear the weights for the whole damn marathon    Serious question   have you talked to your therapist about how the thoughts management feels bogus  I've had that same feeling about some of the therapists I've had  I've had stuff that's off and stuff that clicks  I do self compassion meditations and they feel pretty goofy but I still kinda like them
i love love  i feel its one of the only things i have anymore that i know will give me some happiness
I'm a bit confused  Are you trying to say something about inflammation  or are you trying to say something about acetylcholinesterase  You haven't established that there's any sort of relationship between the two with the research cited in your OP 
Here's one more  "I'm totally independent of the good or the bad opinion of others"   Don't stop  Role playing  and going through the process in your head multiple times will make it feel natural after a while   When you make one successful call  your confidence will build up  And think about good enough  and not perfect calls  And improve from there   I still think you got this  Don't stop now 
No wizard here  Just learned to use the Internet as a shield  My issue is I suck at making conversation   If asked direct questions then I am fine   I guess I just went into it not expecting anything  
You did it  Every little bit counts  Keep at it bud 
I'll be your friend  
You've been through way too much  And you're so young    you don't deserve any of it   I know you feel hurt and betrayed  and maybe you won't want to hear this  But you just can't put that much pressure on someone  "You said you didn't want to be my "lifeline"  you know what that means  You know what that means  That means you are okay with me dying  That means you are okay with me killing myself over the loss of the only person that held me together "  I believe you that she was  most likely  the most important thing in your life  I know that it feels like she has sentenced you to death  But to give someone that responsibility    to suggest that if someone doesn't stay with you that you will hurt yourself    it is a very malicious and manipulative thing to do  I'm not telling you this to make you hurt worse  and I don't think you're a bad person for feeling this way  I just don't want you to make a mistake by acting out of the passion of the momentwithout thinking about it with a more clear head  I don't know what happened  but this behavior will jeopardize any hope of potentially becoming friends again and I don't want that for you 
I get headahces from resting my head all day  where you crying laying down  Also what did they told yoy

Go to the hospital they will give you a test to collect dna that may be left behind from the rapists and they can call the police for you 
Even if you did it's doubtful many would care  And I don't mean to sound all doom and gloom but it's true  Most people are so wrapped up in their own problems for them to stop to help you would be a huge effort  You have to care about yourself enough to seek help from professionals  because I guarantee you no matter how much your friends and family love you they do not want to deal with this horrific condition that has a tendency to return  Depression is mental cancer  
Yes they are  I'm going to chat with my psych about how I can manage it because unfortunately it is causing my old eating disorder to rear its ugly head 
Thank you  thank you very much  I will share the article with her father as well  
I can completely relate to this  If you ever need someone to talk to  feel free to PM me   
I honestly dont know if friends like that exist  would be awesome though  I kind of had a roommate like that in college  but it was mainly bc he would never sleep and text me random texts while i was sleeping  I miss that canadian bro
Pm me and we can talk  I'm 23 male 
Its kind of comforting to know I'm not alone in these feelings its also upsetting knowing others feel similar  I'm sorry 
No I haven't been laying down    Long story short I got let go from my job due to cost cuts  and my mother decided to throw it in my face today how much of a piece of shit I am  She said a lot of things that made me feel horrible including eating what she buys   it's not like I eat a lot of it  just when she cooks and stuff   Which isn't out of the ordinary for her    I'm a single mom  and it's already tough I get no child support  And I'm really trying my best  But it's never good enough and I'm breaking down  Ugh  Now I'm crying again

Based on your post description  you didn't set out looking for sex with someone  let alone everyone else  Please tell someone 
That's really cool actually  I've been through a few accounts but I'm finally situated in one I plan on staying at  In all honesty I think it'd be cool to help support your art  It'd be crazy if we'd crossed paths before 
thank you so much man  if you ever need somebody to talk to hit me up cause you restored my hope
no  none of this is your fault  i'm so sorry you had to deal with this  please please please tell someone you know in real life

Definitely agree  though I was so friggen bummed out today from it   2 hours  and only got just shy of  7   Hopefully tomorrow evening goes better   At least I got a ton of great pokemon in pokemon go   P
Most people feel nervous and awkward when meeting other people    even if they don't act like it   So here's the thing we have to tell ourselves   "That other person   they feel awkward too  I'll just help them meet people by helping them meet me"    I'm usually happily surprised when I stop thinking of myself as the stranger and instead think of myself as a person who helps others feel more comfortable   You may find this hard to believe   I certainly did   But here's a fun fact    only 1 2 of 1  of people actually like going to a party or group where they don't already know someone   That's a tiny portion   Even though when you look around  you'd swear a large portion of people are extroverts   Well  a lot of people are extroverts  but it still doesn't make them feel less insecure or less awkward   they only act like they don't

I had to reply to this  Once  not too long after moving into an apartment on my own for the first time  I left dishes in the sink for so long that a fly apparently laid eggs in one of my bowls  I found maggots  Lots of them  I threw that bowl out  I learned from living there that I will never be able to keep a sanitary kitchen without a dishwasher    hand washing dishes was one of the most monumental of tasks when I was severely depressed

ya that hits me really deep   
I don't have advice but I have a lot of sympathy  It's the same here  My worst anxiety trigger and my strongest anxiety symptom are the same thing 
I know what it feels like to feel the things you are  and I understand how tempting it is  But think of it this way  there are things about myself I dislike  and I have qualities I would rather not have  Now would be a good time to think about what you've done wrong in the past  and how to do otherwise in the future  If you don't like who you are  pinpoint what you think is the source of that and work to change it  Self improvement is impossible if you're dead  If you want to become the person you aspire to be  killing yourself would only make it impossible for you to do so  Just my two cents on the matter  I'd like to hear what you think 
Hi there  6'3" and 33 years old here  I have suffered from self worth issues and depression since I was about 10  Apart from the daughter  we don't have kids  I could relate to a lot of your story  Seemingly good decisions I have made in the past   not realising how it would affect my future mostly due to things completely out of my control  I started concentrating so much on the past and thinking "if only I did this and that" and I just spiraled into a worse and deeper depression     I'm not sure if they will work for you   but these are the things that have helped me out     1  talk about  it  Either to your wife   or your local neighbourhood counsellor or a local support group  I'm not sure if this exists where you're from   but in Australia we have something called "mens shed"  There are heaps of them in each local area and they are designed to get men together to discuss issues that guys are always told not to because we just need to "man up" and not have feelings  They do hobby work   wood work and local neighbourhood projects     2  move forward  This is the hardest one for me  I get so stuck in a rut thinking about what I wanted to do that I forget that today is tomorrow's yesterday  I try to give myself realistic goals and aim for them   like getting myself back in shape etc   Having a schedule for my spare time has really helped     3  relax  Not the sort of relaxation I thought would help   i e   alcohol or computer games   but real relaxation  I have always been on the move and want to keep busy because I don't want to spend any time with my thoughts  so I find it very hard to relax  I have found a couple of apps that help  The one that had helped me the most  which is also free  is called "Depression CBT Self Help Guide" that I have in my smart phone  I cannot recommend this strongly enough     4  ask if your wife is okay  I'm sure you've done this one before   but if she is suffering depression also she may be feeling exactly the same as you  A couple with depression may seem loveless sometimes   but is more just an issue with internalising    5  get fit  Nothing is better for my mental health than psychical health  I used to be quite fit and 5 years of extremely stressful jobs  those life choices again    saw me get quite unfit  which is where I find myself at present  I have been regularly exercising again for a short while and am already feeling a lot better fit it  Perhaps you and your wife can go for walks or to the gym together  It would be a nice way to spend some stress free time together too    Anyway that's what helped me  I hope things work out well for you bud  both for yourself and your family

Yes  this is wrong to say  as it's victim blaming   I understand what you are attempting to say  but this is not the forum for it   No one "puts themselves in a position" to be raped   There are many girls and women who go out  drink  do drugs  and are not sexually abused   That is the expectation any woman should be able to have   Thank you to those who reported these comments

It's the toughest moments that require the strongest faith  I'd like to remind you that you had strong motivations before and some things to work toward  Right now it's not going to be easy and there might not be anything that could change that  To me that's what faith is  working toward something you don't believe exists right now  Your mom is a good reason to do so  Of course you'll always have at least a little support with the great people here  too  Love you

Hi Sadgirlssclub   As FO wrote  the only way we can completely protect the forum is by making it private or 18   neither of which is a good solution   It only makes it more difficult for those who need it to gain access easily   The mods can remove comments on the threads and ban anyone who is harassing you  but that won't stop them from PMing you   You have the ability to block and report anyone you want   If you do  we'd appreciate you letting us know who they are so we can ban them from the site as well     Those are the best tools we have available right now   We do our best to make sure our community is aware that anyone can see what they write   For the most part  it's a pretty safe and controlled environment  but nothing is 100    The mods are open to any suggestions by the community that won't limit access 
Then you haven't read enough  You are still having the crisis because you haven't understood  even science is the meaning  You just haven't gotten there yet   Read more  educate yourself  I was in your situation too for a long time  You also have no idea how the universe ends  you didn't even get the theory right and the theory is outdated  most cosmologists believe the universe will expand forever  and based on our most recent looks at dark matter and the expansions of the universe  it likely will    Just educate yourself  You will sit back and laugh that you ever thought you had anything figured out  because our insignificance and our lack of knowing is the only thing we truly know 
I don't really have a solution  I used to just have hypersomnia  Now I have both hypersomnia and occasional insomnia  It's a really big pain in the ass  I tried doing sleep hypnosis videos on YouTube  I think that helps a bit  Dealing with headphone cords and such is a hassle though  I should be sleeping now       Edit  I have will say this though  my personal anecdote is that I've tried doing a "reset" before by just staying awake for 36 hours a couple of times  It's never really worked out 
I've been taking the supplements for depression and inflammation reduction  Inflammation has been linked to depression  Coincidentally  the supplements also seem to have some degree of acetylcholinerase inhibition  which could explain why they initially help with my mood but in the long run my mood becomes worse 
Hi there    Yeah I'm right there with you  I started a new project management job  and I've never done project management  So many new faces  networking  and making important decisions   it's a lot to take it  I don't have much advice  but I told myself that when I leave work  I have to accomplish finish a task  Correlating and reflecting my day on something positive helps me get over the fear of something going wrong  I hope that helps

It's not anxiety  You're a normal person who doesn't know what they want to do with their life  Give college a try  You'll meet new people and have a whole new experience than you're used to in high school  While you're there maybe you'll realize what you want to do with your life  You'll have a better chance of getting the type of job that isn't 9 5 if you have a college degree  
I didn't have much guidance growing up and still don't have any type of mentor in my life  My parents are complete turds of people to say the least and I have pretty much been in control of my own future since adolescence   Sometimes I feel as if I have no direction in life as a result of this and it can be frustrating that I don't have that structure   But what gives me peace of mind is knowing that I AM taking the necessary steps to get where I need to be in life   Life is hard  Good luck

I used to get these kinds of transient pains a lot  After numerous medical workups and tests with no apparent cause I finally found relief  It turns out that taking a magnesium supplement completely stopped them and now if I miss a few days of magnesium  they come back  It's worth a try  The best one I've found is Whole Foods 365 brand magnesium

Around a year and a half ago when driving a car or when alone at home I would occasionally really scream  Since then the classic Edvard Munch painting 'The Scream' has become a favorite  I do it much much less now  Looking back I'd say screaming like that helped me to express and understand some complicated emotions  Really  just keep swimming  let yourself scream sometimes  and make a little progress 
They held you down while they penetrated you  The fact that they held you down is a clear indicator that you did not consent  This is apart from the fact that as a minor you cannot legally give consent  These two facts make literally everything else about this irrelevant    They've told you you're gross and a slut to make you believe that it's your fault and to break down your self esteem so you don't tell anyone  Posting this is a huge step in the right direction but you need to go to the police  I can't imagine how difficult that must feel  but it is the only way that these guys will get the punishment they deserve  They took advantage of you and everything that happened only reflects on them  and what despicable human beings they are  It does not reflect on you whatsoever  no matter what they said   Please tell the police  Please get help  
The answer really lies in why you don't like these sorts of events  If the reason you are uncomfortable in these situations is that you are constantly worrying about what the other people are thinking about you  or changing your behavior because of them  then it's probably social anxiety  You may have an unreasonable fear of being negatively judged by these people  which is social anxiety in a nutshell   If you just don't like noise or how the conversation is typically more superficial  then you may just be an introvert   
Yeah  it's hard to make friends    hey  no problem though  I'm glad it meant something  And I hope things start improving for you

Hi Kisua   There are answers to all of your questions  but if you haven't sought out therapy with someone trained in sexual assault trauma  it's going to be difficult to move forward     What I can tell you is that you can re learn how to enjoy yourself sexually with a partner you like or are in love with   It just takes  time  practice and patience for both of you   It would help for you partner to know what you've gone through  so he can help you to experience pleasure and orgasm together     Of course  I don't know your specific history  but my guess based on women I've worked with  is that you are drawn towards men you don't like because you have a need to punish yourself for what happened   Another possibility is that by going out with men you aren't attracted to  part of you is hoping you won't be drawn to doing anything sexual with them   You can say which fits best for you   Panic attacks are an anxiety response from the primal part of our brain that is trying to warn us of danger   With panic attacks though  we are being fooled because there is no actual danger in the moment   Knowing this is one step towards dealing with them and learning how to reduce them over time  If you like  I can provide what are called "grounding techniques" to help you with this   One book I recommend for women who are wanting to be sexual and having a hard time is Wendy Maltz' "The Sexual Healing Journey "  It's best used after going through recovery with a therapist  but it may be of help to you   The best thing is to keep asking  writing  and talking about what you need   Either here or with partners you trust   All my best 
I think work anxiety is very common but you've also got a very high stress job  You might want to look at other options  The pressure you're describing would make me bananas  After a particularly tough gig as an autism aide I discovered that I would rather work a physically demanding job than have one that has a lot of mental pressure  Some people thrive on and even need the adrenaline of a job like sales but I think for me it would be a freaking nightmare  If there are parts of it that you like  maybe you can find a sales position somewhere more low key 
If you want to get off meds you should seriously talk to your doctor  
Sounds like you may have anxiety  If it was really bad you could go see a doctor  If you have a cold with a stuffy nose it might make it worse because breathing right is a pretty big deal with anxiety  Just my thought  
I am anxious every Monday night because I have therapy every Tuesday   During the day or evening I try to write some things down about the past week  things to discuss  etc   Focusing on therapy topics for just 5 minutes greatly reduces the amount of stress I'll feel the rest of the day night 
More than most can do  myself included     Keep up the good work 
Thank you    I wish I was   Part of me wishes she would read this   Part of me just needed to get it out   I don't know what to do going forward    I tried so hard   Giving everything I had   I wish it mattered

I cant even do one correctly honestly  good for you  D
I'm not too sure what your point is in re  that everyone has social anxiety  I agree you are correct  but SA is more typified by social anxiety that is problematic  unreasonable and atypical  It sounds like you're trying to deny you have a problem by pretending everyone else feels anxiety too  when they don't  at least not to the same degree

Always do this  i usually imagine myself as a completely different person  
I conquered my crushing anxiety about my grades and specifically my classes this semester  I fell behind by almost 3 months in my robotics class but clawed my way back through seven programming assignments in one week  and even checked my transcript  I got 2 As and 2 Bs this semester  I feel that under my situation  most people would have given up and dropped out of school  and I'm really proud of myself for surviving a situation that seemed impossible  It's hard enough to get decent grades at an elite engineering school  University of Michigan  but to do it with panic attacks every time I worked on any content related to my programming classes was fucking heroic  I also managed to confront my bizarrely specific fear of checking my grades   Tomorrow I must register for next semester's classes  It is a huge anxiety trigger for me because I am in my last semester of college and I envision scenarios where I don't get enough credits to graduate and screw myself over  Wish me luck

I read something great yesterday about anxiety being when you're too focused on the future and what might happen  and rumination is when you're too focused on the past  I'm going to try managing my anxiety with meditation and exercise  Anxiety is definitely about not being in control   or really more about not being okay that we're not in control because none of us are in control  It's great that you found someone you like  Read up on meditation and maybe give it a try  
Yes it does  
Hi There    First off you aren't alone    I've dealt with severe anxiety for as long as I can remember    Yo have to figure out you but there is millions of people who deal with the same thing everyday    First off if you have any caffeine in your diet cut it out  Second of all don't try and hide your anxiety  tell her about it  I'm sure she will be nothing but supportive    Try to set a routine and keep yourself busy as it typically helps most people    For the times when your anxiety is out of control I suggest downloading headspace the app it's great to listen to and it should help calm you down    Last just know that you are perfectly normal and anxiety is a beautiful things  The darkest tunnels can lead to the brightest of lights  It will make your mind and spirit stronger and more creative than you could have ever imagined    Feel free to private message me    Stay strong and remember we aren't given more than we can handle  
 Don't know compassion pit but my best guess is it's like blahtherapy or 7cups  check those

When you're anxious your breathing becomes very shallow so try some deep breathing  Also make yourself some toast  I don't know why but toast is comforting 
Is it anxiety  I have the same issue related to coffee  acid reflux  and post nasal trip  It's aggravated during certain seasons too 
I know this is a scretch  I will tell you this from my own perspective though   Could it be that you are smilling because issue that is tormenting your life is adressed in some form  Your mind probably wants to tell some one but you probably keep it inside you   Most people don't discuss things like these with people who have these thoughts as they believe it is not good for them  but this stuff when it is discussed can help  It is adressing the problem  most people ignore this as it is too dark and uncomfortable to discuss and falsely believe that it will perhaps make you act upon your dangerous thoughts 
Wooooooaw this isn't your fault at all and this is absolutely not ok  They got you drunk and physically held you    how can you even consider it is your fault    these peoples are bastards  Go to the hospital  please 
I literally have this same thing and I always thought I was crazy   I hate when nobody responds to my texts  and yet even when we talk I'm antsy  It's so odd  I don't know what it is but my guess is it's anxiety paired with low self esteem  needing validation  paired with a desire to get your mind off the negative  At least for me that's what I think it is   
Honestly I keep finding myself coming back to the comments just to remind myself that I'm not at fault and the guy really is a piece of utter shit and that I'm not just imagining things  Funny how a single event unfolds into being fucked up for a while  
Thank you  I'm really hoping it goes well 
What job do you do     let's talk
I'm kind of the same  I think about my loved ones dying all the time and makes me feel so upset I get anxiety  Whenever I read about a person dying in the news I imagine it happening to my family and it deepens my depression  The thing is that I do it to myself and I try to control myself from doing that  I had to unsubscribe from many news feeds just so I'd stop imagining my loved ones dying all the time  
unfortunately it really doesnt matter since my father has the last word  cannot wait to move out  whenever that is
My roommate has left them out that long multiple times  It got so bad that we just switched to paper plates and plastic utensils 
i think it was cool of you to get it all out  i dont think the journey can end here though

Hi kali   It's difficult to give you any really helpful answers   I will say knowing is always better than not knowing when it comes to a history of sexual abuse   Especially when it's affecting you in ways you aren't certain of   If your mother has answers that may help you understand things better  than it will be better for you in the long run    That said   without the support of a therapist or at least a support network of friends trusted others who can be there for you  learning more details may have a short term impact on you that could be very difficult to deal with   I typically recommend to my clients that we increase sessions or other supports to ensure that getting new information won't cause more disruption in their lives than they are capable of handling   You are clear about your history of depression and addiction and I'd hate to have this spiral from your control  assuming it's under your control now   There are some alternatives to therapy if you cannot afford it   One would be seeking out a therapist who will do some pro bono or drastic sliding scale work with you   Others would be utilizing ad hoc supports like RAINN  a chat forum like pandys org  or here   7 Cups of Tea is a moderate choice as it's not done by professionals  but can provide free support when you need it   I'll be honest that this work is best done with a qualified professional and I wouldn't want to set you up to destabilize if you don't have the supports in place to take in whatever your mom has to tell you   I'm sorry I can't be more decisive  but hopefully this will give you some guidance in how to approach this   All my best   
This is exactly how I feel  And the worst part is when she randomly texted me saying she doesn't want me in her life anymore and that she was only my friend cuz she felt sorry for me  Sigh  
I get you  I've pretty much given up on art now  My inability to do good just makes me so angry and hate  art  especially myself  So now I avoid getting motivated and start drawing cuz I know I'm gna give up and get hurt at the end  
Please  i know this is late but please go look for some kind of help  If you can PM me man  just need to know youre okay
The constant hurt that must be endured is the worst of all    it makes time feel slow  For  me at least     At the same time    I think things can get better  In degrees    but even that takes time  Like baby steps from what about Bob

yeah  giving up and getting hard is all too associated with drawing  just feeding into my already breeding negativity  considering just deleting my tumblr so i can walk away
I mean  I can't draw a straight line so you can't be this bad at drawing  Drawing seems like a really fun skill to learn  and I hope you end up finding your own art style  whatever it may be 
i can get like 50 on a good day  and even thats not that much  p   like a lot of others i was in the same place you were  where i couldnt even do like 7  just keep at it and youll get better  lifting weights also makes pushups wayyyyy easier  went from less than 35 to 50 in literally 1 day after i lifted weights for like a half hour  p   im not sure how it works but it worked for me so if you want you can try it and see if it helps    i dont like arms tho  i like to run more tbh  keeps me     not fat i guess xD   good job tho man keep it up
You're totally right about this one IMO   Since you guys are bringing it up though  I will say this   the "fag" issue may be manifesting itself because you are worried people see you that way    If you can learn to not care if someone calls you a "fag"  you will be a lot happier   Maybe that means that you have to face some fears related to it    in my opinion everyone is somewhere in the middle   this realization helped me a ton when dealing with similar fears  At a minimum  this is something that I would run by your psychologist  
Ive never tried meditation and to be quite honest I don't completely understand it  Would you mind telling me about how you meditate and how it works 
I'll do that  Thank you

I think it's really brave of you to share your story  I have been through quite a bit these last few years and have had depression since middle school  however I've always been able to control it until recently  Thank you so much for opening up and for the advice  I'll try to find a way to motivate myself to start doing some of these things   Also I do watch league streams play it myself  League is life  Even playing in local tournaments soon 
Feel like I could've written this  I have a terrible relationship with my father too and just having him anywhere near me makes me want to die  Spent the holidays getting drunk alone in my room    Love your username btw  Wish I was a cat too 
Thank you that helps  Just walking around make my head feel a little better 
I will  My therapist gave me her phone number as a means to contact her or ask questions  
Thank you so much  I really needed to read something like that  I really appreciate it 
That's some good advice  thank you  I'll try that next time I'm in a similar situation
This could have been written by me  minus the part about having your own place to live  Everybody makes mistakes  There's so few right ways to deal with our types of problems   they always say like "tell somebody if you're feeling down desperate suicidal" but society is not exactly able to help you with that stuff   it just ends up alienating you even more  Spilling your guts wouldn't necessarily have resulted in keeping all your relationships perfectly intact  That stuff is hard for normal people to deal with    First of all you need to understand that there are reasons for all the things you said and did   not good reasons  but reasons  You must have felt confused  scared  lonely  anxious  dejected  the list goes on  So it's not like you made those poor choices on purpose  or while in your right mind   The second thing to keep in mind is that you can't control the past  You can only look forward  with the knowledge of your mistakes    Whether that means making up with some of your friends  or finding new ones  it doesn't really matter  Take what you've learned and adjust yourself accordingly  Every day is different 
i dont think im bad  but i think im painfully mediocre  everything i do is worth a good scroll while on your way to better  more pleasant art  im the filler space   thanks though

I think they have moments of inaccuracy  if you are talking about the wrist ones  Mine would have moments where it would spike to 150 or something crazy while just sitting down  and my heart body felt normal the whole time
I actually brought it up to them today because it's just impossible for me to manage on my own at this point and because of that I now have to pay for college  my car  and my phone if I want to keep going to KU  If I move back home they would continue to fund my education  So that didn't go well   I don't understand why I'm being punished for needing help

Please tell your parents and go to the police   This is not your fault  what those guys did is disgusting  I know you are scared and embarrassed right now  but you need to go to the police and report these sick fucks  or they're just gonna do it to other girls  You are underage  so this is probably in the realm of child molestation  That's super serious  and these fuckers could go away for a long time  but only if reported for their crimes

I intend on just killing my self I give up I can't take 23 years of hell anymore 
I'm a psych major and I was actually looking into EMDR a while back so I might try to find a therapist who does that  When my parents made me come home the therapist I was seeing was not beneficial at all so I've been hesitant to try again  I also don't think I was ready to talk about any of it at that point either  
She gets how i hate parties and she doesn't want me to have a bad time but I don't want to force her to stay home or make her leave her friends just because of me  I stuck out the night for her  
I give up I can't take 23 years of hell and selfishness anymore 
Hey  had some similar issues   Have lost both parents   dad died when I was in high school  mom died about a year and a half ago    I used to have anxiety about losing my mom  and after her passing I have definitely had worsening symptoms and constant thoughts about mortality and circumstances about her death    The advice I can give comes just from my own thoughts and kind of how I've dealt with things  death is part of life  our finite time here makes life special  and we never know how long any of us have   Spend time with the ones you love  call them  do things with them  make great memories and make the most of the time you have together    I also have found comfort at r death   might be worth wandering over there

Some good suggestions on that site  I used to suffer from crippiling anxiety  during a panic attack my partner would sit me down and read  online  symptoms of anxiety panic attacks  and then get me to write down what I was feeling and compare   Works from multiple angles
If you feel like it was the right decision  then it was    It may feel like he fixed you  but you got to be careful with that line of thinking  If he was controlling  like you said  it's likely manipulation  Manipulative people  abuse you  tear you down and make you feel worthless  Then they make you feel better  it tricks you into thinking they're doing good for you  it makes you think they're solving your problems when really they are creating artificial problems for you    It takes an incredible amount of will power to see manipulation and break free from it 
I feel like things can get better but it won't ever be fixed 
can I see anything you've drawn 
Did you ever have nausea associated with anxiety attacks before in other situations  When does the anxiety come on and which happens first  What triggers anxiety for you in other situations   I had a problem with not being generally hydrated enough so I would drink too much water during my workouts and get nauseous   Have you been consistently drinking pre workouts or anything of that sort that could cause it  Supplements  Vitamins  Medications  Anything your taking in other than food that may be the culprit     I don't actually expect you to answer any of that but if something else sticks out let us know 
As an atheist i dont believe there is a set point to live  I think we pave our own journey  achievements  and goals in life  We make our life what we want it to be   For me  this is my way of kinda coping with shit  Makes it easier for me to say "i can change this" 
I'm not really doing it yet  just researching  but the idea I think is that you learn to focus and calm your mind  I'm starting with this breathing exercise   http   mobile nytimes com 2016 11 09 well mind breathe exhale repeat the benefits of controlled breathing html    Then I'm hoping to get a good meditation app on my phone  It's my understanding that when you meditate you focus on a word you repeat and block out everything else 
I get this  Kids are more frightening that adults because they will be more overtly disrespectful to you  If they don't like you  or don't want your attention  they aren't worried about letting you know  or don't care if you know about it   Not only is it unpleasant having someone be rude to you  there are often people around to witness it which is all the more embarrassing    I was once at party where there were kids and this kid pretty much realised I was the weakest socially  and harassed me to get laughs out of my mates  It was humiliating and infuriating   
i promised myself that if i made this thread that i wouldnt post any art because i dont want pity points or anything    trust me  its just painfully mediocre  not bad  not good at all
Agreed  I'm a very introverted  reserved person  and I always imagined myself as the one who'd always be alone  I've always been very lacking socially speaking  and I still am now for the most part  Lately  though  I've been trying as hard as I can to improve my ability to talk to people  I've just been  doing it   whether or not I want to  I'm still super awkward  but I think I'm getting better  the more I do it  You learn what works and what doesn't  and it gets easier  You're right when you say it's a skill  a skill that  when you become more adept at  makes it easier to get through that initial awkward ness  and actually  connect  with people  That said  I'm still bad at it  Practice  practice  practice  
I feel the same way man  We just do things that distract us  I guess thats why some people are so into music  gaming  writing  etc  It just helps us cope with shit If you ever wanna talk man  just Pm me  Ill be there   
I'm just going to end it I'm tired trying 
I was at a career fair talking to Bayer and I thought it was going fine  but then one of the recruiters suddenly said "Don't worry its just as awkward for us " Like wtf I didn't think I was being awkward but okay lady  thanks for letting me know 
Sometimes I just need to vent    And hearing other peoples stories  makes me feel less alone in my fight and allows me to gain alternate views with which to view my life from 
Honestly fear is the biggest answer  I tried coming out to my bi uncle  who was in the closet at the time  and he told my mom  My mom told my dad and it was a whole big mess  My mom pretends it didn't happen and often asks me questions like when am I gonna find a gf  Or on the rare occasion I go out she'd say something like "You look good  what would you do if a girl asked you out"  It's weird because she accepted him but not me and says that she just doesn't want any of her kids to be gay because it's embarrassing  And getting out on my own is the most terrifying thing to me rn because I don't know if I can sustain myself at this age  I also don't wanna lose the few  3  friends that I do have no matter how good of friends they are  like I said  being completely alone terrifies me and is my real problem  and I don't wanna be made to feel disgusting about myself by being bombarded with sexual insult like the first and only time I tried to come out  But thank you for listening and trying to help

Id rather have the ONE friend  i only have ONE friend right now  and he has some kind of mental problem  its like extreme adhd or something  its tough to explain  hes totally different from other people  idk what exactly it is bc ive never asked and i never will ask  but after going through cancer AND chemo  he was the only dude there for me  besides family  and not even all of my family was there for me  i learned through cancer i have NO friends besides him  And i can never repay him for that  The only bad thing is is that we cant have those deep conversations just bc of his mental ability bc his 12 year old little brother is literally smarter than him  hes 26   A true friend is priceless tho  Hes the only one ive ever had
Congratulations  Today I can't get off the couch  I've just found out my gorgeous little cat  she's 11 and one of my best friends  doesn't have much longer  she has cancer and her liver is disintegrating   So I applaud you  Don't let the depression keep you down  We may lose a battle or two every day  but one day we'll win the way  
my girlfriend struggled with depression for a good many years and it was absolutely horrible for her  but therapy helped her come a long way and she's doing way better now these days   i may be in the middle of it and you might be too  but know that there is a goal somewhere out there
I can relate 100 percent  At the moment it is 1am and I am wide awake  I've tried all my meds and nothing seems to be helping  I am a manager of a large medical facility and had an altercation with a male staff today when no one was around  The male staff verbally abused me  however  as someone with BP2 my reaction was not the greatest and I lost my cool for about 1 minute before regaining control of the situation  The staff member is extremely manipulative and actually isn't one of my staff  but rather a member of another medical facility under the same name  we share staff   This situation would be tough for anyone  but as I am new and still learning to deal with being bipolar and my diagnosis I am feeling extremely guilty and worried about returning to work tomorrow

Mega props to you for reaching out and inviting him to stuff  Even though he didn't show  I'm sure it meant a lot  I don't know how familiar you are with depression   related problems  but it's real hard to even do things that we want to do    or basic things like showering      Personally I don't think there's anything wrong with confronting him about the post  especially if you found it because you were interested in his music   personality like you described  but you'd know better than any of us   It's hard to help people like us because sometimes we feel like we don't want help  or are broken beyond any improvement  The only person that can  really  help him is himself  Depression makes you so cripplingly passive apathetic that it's really difficult though   Seems like you guys are on the right track  Keep hitting him up every once in a while and inviting him out even if he still doesn't show  Make sure he is aware of any counseling services your school might offer  All of his problems sound temporary and circumstantial so hopefully it's nothing he can't beat

What is fixed     if a wall has a crack  and you tear it down to build another  is it fixed    But the mind isn't a wall  It's more like a tree  As we grow older  so does it  And wounds were once it wept from will become scars    and although the scars remind us  they don't make the tree weak  
Have you got any examples of your work  I'm sure you're better than 90  of people heh 
I'm sorry this happened  Keeping up with reporting and blocking seems to be the best solution    I wrote out a story asking for advice  I got a creepy message  I ignored it and deleted my post immediately  
I have never had a sex drive 
Its always been difficult for me to have female friends  But youre right  they are best for that  not to be sexist but my past experiences show its true   I either become attracted to them and then they talk to other guys and i get pissed or they get attracted to me and i talk to other girls and it never ends well  They always want to have sex eventually and i dont want to  mainly bc one had herpes  but thats a whole different story  and they get pissed or turned off bc they think i think theyre not attractive  Ugh  just so complicated  
see my other response  im sorry  please trust my mediocrity and inability
Fixed as in no more depression   I feel like that's just a healthy way of thinking about it but ultimately things still won't get completely better  Thanks though

Hey  it's incredibly thoughtful that you're putting this kind of effort into helping your friend  I doubt talking to anyone in his college block would do a lot  to be honest  he likely doesn't talk to them any more than anyone else  Telling him about see by the post would be alright  so long as he knows that you know his Reddit account  It might help some  so he knows what y'all already know about his situation    Again  you really are a special kind of friend  and I hope you're able to help your friend  Please update if it goes well  we love a story with a happy ending for one of us

I am so sorry to hear this  so truly sorry for your loss  My moms passing a few years ago was very much like this  very unexpected  She was 59  my dad had gone to pick her up from dialysis  and i was over cooking them dinner  I realized they'd been gone too long  called my dad  who didn't want to worry us so he just told us her blood pressure wasn't coming up  a common complication after dialysis  But a few minutes later my sister pulled into the driveway and said we'd better head up to the hospital  She was unconscious by the time we arrived  her heart only coming back briefly  They did all they could but she was gone    I had a lot of guilt about what stress she may have been under  I was just out of state with my husband not two days before  where we decided to divorce  and I was moving in with my girlfriend   I wasn't cheating  I want that to be clear  though I don't wish to explain the situation   She was very worried about me  I know  and I have this fear that it was my fault  I know she was happy for me as well  but stress seems to do more damage than than happiness will ever do good  I was so ashamed of myself and afraid that her concern for me was a huge factor here   I only go into this so you know where I'm coming from  I hope it's alright to share these details  This pain  this sense of unreality and disbelief  there are no words to describe how it feels  But I want to say please don't linger on this guilt if you can help it  You can go over every angle  every moment you could have done something differently  But that is futile  Those are details  In the end  I'm sure she knew that you loved her  and I'm sure you know she loved you  No matter what was in the past  no matter what you did or didn't say  you did the best you could for each other and that is all we can ever ask of each other  You may have days of regretting the way you behaved toward her  then have days when you are bitter about how she acted toward you  But the details will never take away how much you loved each other  Let these doubts pass  When you feel the guilt and pain  focus on the feeling of love  That is what matters   I wish I had better advice  but it's a personal journey to get through this and no matter how well anyone wishes us we must bear it ourselves  It's terribly hard  Be kind and patient to yourself and your family  Don't be afraid or ashamed of your feelings  face them and work through them  Please don't blame yourself  you didn't do anything wrong    I know I'm just a random stranger  but I honestly do wish you my condolences and sympathy  If it helps  and you want someone to talk to  feel free to pm me  Above all  take care of yourself   
I'd be happy to make a new friend     I'm currently in a voluntary psych ward and hope to meet and talk to some good professionals tomorrow who will help get me back on track too   message me please   
It definitely makes it go away to an extent I won't lie  Not completely  but eases the symptoms a bit 
Pinched nerve  Get up and stretch and walk around a little and see how it feels 
I challenge you to go to things you want to go to by yourself  I used to feel identically to the way you do  All of my friends got really into weed  did nothing else   So what i did was just started going on my own  and I tell you what  it's actually a way better experience  In my opinion   If you want to take a break and eat something  you do just that  if you're having a good time and want to keep going  no problem  If you're having a bad time an want to leave  done  I'll admit  it feels weird sometimes  but even if it's not for you  going to stuff like that alone is probably the simplest way to find people who will go with you next time 
i m really sorry   hope you can process grief in a healthy way  my father died few years ago and i still havent processed tht

It's not your fault  You did nothing wrong  Your brain just decided on it own that it was going to be sad  You have no control over this choice you brain made  You and your brain a different not literally but metaphorically 
the nausea you're feeling is almost entirely anxiety  and maybe because of your diet  You'll probably never vomit unless you come down with a stomach virus or food poisoning  but try not to obsess over that 
Yeah  rapists say that sort of thing 
I don't need some one to jsjt say they care I need somebody who actually does care about how I feel and my situation I appreciate it if you do and or either way but I really can't take it anymore 
You were raped  This is pretty clear cut 
Totally agree about the physical exercise being amazing for mental health too   I'm a big cyclist and skier and I love hiking and camping too   When I'm going fast   pushing myself to the limit to chase some cool guy I see also pushing it to the limit I'm like so happy   i honestly race people just hoping to make a stranger into a friend   It's like how I interact with the outer world now that I'm so enmeshed in my own inner world   Trying to break out of just living a life internal is hard though
A suicide is usually not the way out  and that's the thought of neurotypical people  however people like us with severe anxiety or depression   do not agree with that thought  Yes you might see it as selfish  however I would trust them saying it's not a good idea as  no offence  their brain functions better than someone who is mentally ill  
Good luck  Let me know if you need anything at all in deciding anything  I think both are super helpful for different reasons but I'd start with CBT first   3

That is terrible and I understand how you must be feeling right now as I myself have just gotten home after watching my grandmother pass away  She was diagnosed with terminal cancer about 6 months ago so the blessing in disguise was that we had some time to time to make some final memories  Unfortunately I still feel like I never got to truely say good bye  My grandmother loved living and despite my grandfathers constant reminder of their age and the meaning behind that fact  she never would let on about her mortality right up to the end  In fact just last night I was sitting next to her joking and laughing with her  New years eve we talked about my plans and made me promise not to get in a car  However  I never was able to have the talk and let her know my deepest feelings of how much she meant to me and how devastated I will be without her in my life any longer  I feel she didnt want me to worry about her dieing so in her own way she thought she was protecting me by not letting on what was happening to her  However  we were both very aware of the ultimate outcome of her diagnosis     Today I woke up to a phone call from my mother crying telling me that my grandmother has lost consciousness and will likely be gone by the end of the day  Of course I knew this day was coming  but oddly  you always feel it'll be next year  month  week not today  You never fully accept that this person you care for so much will no longer exist until you know longer have the choice  hell it still doesn't feel real as I sit here typing this  When I arrived at her house she was lying in her bed with my family around her unconscious forcefully breathing  I gave her a kiss told her everything I wish that I had said the night prior to ears that could no longer hear and watched her stop breathing an hour later  My grandmother lost 60 pounds in three months  watching her waste away to nothing and seeing her lay in that bed and watch the life slip out of her was one of the hardest moments of my life      Nothing anyone can say will make this easier on you as I know it will be the same for me  I just hope you can find some comfort in me sharing my story as I found some in yours knowing that there are others out there dealing with the same crushing emotions that you are  I am so sorry how sudden this was and imagine that adds an extra twist to the dagger in your heart  What helps though is that there are many things known between two people that share love for each other that do not need to be said  Your mother knows how much she loved you and you loved her just as you do towards her  The last thing your mother and my grandmother would want is for us to be heartbroken simply because the words "goodbye" did not come out of our mouths  The emotions that we shared for our loved ones go much deeper then that making that verbal word all but irrelavant    We have some rough days ahead of us but please take care  if you ever need someone to talk to feel free to message me  
Call for help  Please  There's still a lot to do  and you need to be there  Hope you're okay   3
In a similar situation  Great to hear good news for someone  
Me too  although sometimes he's a unwilling companion  whenever I hug the guy my days are a little less gloomier 
IMO the best thing for panic attacks is meditation   If you don't know how to do that then just breathe very deeply and slowly  Wait a couple seconds between inhalations exhalations  Try to only focus on things you can physically feel right now   like  the weight of yourself sitting in your chair  the way your clothes feel  the weird fluids and tensions running through your body  Try to clear out any lingering thoughts on intangible things   don't worry about anything except this exact moment  Allow yourself to slow down   If you can figure out how to defuse a panic attack then hopefully you'll manage until you can get into another session 
Will do 
Muscular pain from constant video games  
I'm pretty familiar with depression ever since my parents split up  and I know what he's going through with his college friends since a similar situation happened to me some time ago      The difference is I had a really stellar group of friends to help me  no matter what  so it breaks my heart to hear that he feels like he has no one to talk to 
I actually did the exact same  I'm surprised I'm not the only one  p

Magnesium acts as a muscle relaxant and most people are deficient in magnesium  It can be difficult to get enough through diet  I originally took it for anxiety on advice from a book about natural anxiety treatment since I don't tolerate psych meds well and it had the side effect of clearing up the dull ache and sharp  transient pains in my chest and sternum  Worth a try

Which streams do you like to watch  I have been recently enjoying bekuhs streams lately since I'm overseas and it fits my sleeping pattern she is an awesome grill   I play in oce  I would assume that you play in NA  I am ranked platinum haha   my whole life to get that rank lol  Are you a support main  Kappa   That's so radd your playing in a tournament      You  Go Grill   
Yes this happens to me all the time I second guess everyone and wonder if they are telling the truth and I keep asking and asking for reassurance that they are not lying to me

A trick I found that had worked wonders for me  do a little chore every time there's a commercial on when I'm watching a show  Commercial  Start a load of laundry  Empty the dishwasher  Set out the trash  Pick up the bedroom  Wipe down the kitchen counter  Sweep the bathroom  Little things like that  one or two at a time depending on how long the commercials are  Simple  little chores that over the course of one show can add up to a picked up and often cleaned up home  
In that case  I'll definitely look towards supplements  I actually bought some not long ago  They're 250mg  but I'm not sure exactly how much to supplement  if I'm honest   Edit  says one tablet daily with meal  That works  haha 
This is going to be me pretty soon  Because of the holidays  work has been pretty slow  but oh man starting this week onward  its gonna get crazy  I'm gonna get yelled at  looked down upon and just be absolutely broken   at which point ill probably have a panic attack  i mean I almost had one when it wasn't busy at my job  I hope you make it through this  OP
I'm so sorry    my truck is my baby and my life  I don't know what I would do if I lost it  I often fantasize about driving into a wall or traffic but never in my own truck  I'll kill myself long before I hurt my truck  What kind of car 
That's exactly how I feel I want to stay positive and do better but low self esteem and social anxiety simply kill it for me
When I get like this I like to use that energy for something  You need an outlet    I see you said you can't workout because of dizziness  However that energy can be used elsewhere that dosnt require something physical  For me I play FPS video games  The adrenaline I get from the anxiety helps me in the game and when using that energy it eventually fades and I become relaxed    If you don't like video games you can just apply the same thing to anything else  Take a bath  But instead of just taking a bath clean the tub first  really well  Then reward yourself    Breathing in a paper bag helps too  Focus on your breath and calm your breathing    Hope something works  I feel ya  
But then you realize that it will probably never happen  as is the reality for most people  
If you're a girl then I'm down lol
After I read your post  I thought to myself that I wanted to reassure you about all the people you still have to meet in your life yet   And that I wish for you to not let just 2 people in your life to ruin your life   But then I immediately remembered how I was in a sort of similar situation like half a year ago  Shit was so real they committed me to the hospital against my will    So  I just want you to know that I know exactly how that betrayal feels  Like you wish you could be angry but all you feel is hurt and that sucks because there is no power in feeling hurt   If this help at all  its been about half a year since then and I mean of course things are super different  but i've moved on   Its so fucking disappointing when people aren't what you thought they'd be 
Yes  
It is NOT your fault   It was sexual assault

I just wanted to say that I totally relate to this  It's a kind of covert anxiety that as an adult I've managed to learn to hide over time  I love it when people are like "you're not anxious" and I just want to say "oh yeah  Then why does my brain keep telling me that something important is on fire somewhere all the time "
I really do hope so

Take melatonin  or if you don't have any Benadryl  You'll be put like a light    Remember too if using your phone before bed to turn the brightness down or change the settings to night mode  This will help the brain relax and not be so stimulated   Read a book or graphic novel  It took me 10 weeks to read the first walking dead because I would read it before bed and not last 5 mins lol    Hope something works  I feel ya  
I'm done meeting people   I've always been a big introvert  so my only course of action is really to isolate myself further until the loneliness and suicidal urges take over  but that's a ways off   Plus  this whole situation has caused me to think thrice about letting anyone in  period  
That makes me cringe 
Thank you   
I take 400mg a day  The only side effect to magnesium is that it can loosen your bowels a bit  so I'd recommend taking it when you'll be home until you know how it'll affect you    
I'm actually an ad main with mid as my secondary role  I love watching C9 Sneaky and yes I play on NA  I haven't played much ranked though so idk what my rank is  Planning on playing more ranked this season  I just played hundreds of norms last season xD Preparing for the tournament is actually pretty fun though

Judging from you he does have a super group of freinds so hopefully he can see that  i would think asking him about it could be good  i know i would have liked it if someone from my group of "freinds" had seen one of my posts on here and asked me about it  shows that they care  i would believe that if you do ask him about it hes likey to enjoy that  probably would be a little bit awkward to start but once he knows you care and want to understand i imagine he will be pretty happy with it
I don't have any friends  I drifted away from them  They all have lots of friends and I don't really matter  I don't think I will ever have friends again  I'm too shy to make new friends  I wish I had friends too  
I'm not religious but if I don't pray every night or do a cross three times   EXACTLY THREE TIMES  whenever anxious something really bad will happen to me 
To put it very simply  CBT is how you think about things  and DBT is controlling your emotions  For bipolar  it seems CBT is more useful  It definitely was for me  and I have recently looked into DBT and it seems to have a huge foundation built from CBT  Look up the 10 cognitive distortions and really study and apply them  They improved my life tremendously    DBT seems to be mostly for people with BPD  but of course it can be applied to any disorder  I don't find much of a use for it

One thought  and depends on if you have time  is to help donate time volunteer at a local shelter aspca  you may not be able to take the animals home  but will allow you to get some time with a dog cat   
Well you're trying to solve your problem with the wrong shaped block here   Your way of thinking goes "success   no anxiety" when it should go "no anxiety   success"   You have to find out why you are getting this anxiety in the first place  Talk to a therapist  You won't believe how much just talking will do   I feel like you're adding a lot of weight ontop of already a substantial amount of weight by pin pointing and amplifying when you see yourself do something wrong  You need to take your mistakes and improve on them and not beat yourself up about it    Hope you find something  I feel ya  
Thank you  This post was very validating  I rarely feel that anyone gets the depths of despair I felt this year unless I really explain it and I'm not interested in reliving the rape especially  I will have to read more on this theory concerning Freud  I never thought of it from that point of view  I've been thinking the exact opposite actually  Assuming since I've been victimized and know the feeling I should be the last one to want anyone else to suffer  Like I said  your understanding of what may be going on feels more plausible to me  The only time I've considered trying to go back to the old me  idealistic  hopeful  constantly let down and insulted  is when my children are around me when I consider acting out  Up to this point I've raised them with my previous beliefs and they are very kind  considerate  thoughtful children  I do not want my children indulging in risky behaviors  as I do  However I know from experience  society does not appreciate kindness and compassion the way I used to  I want my children to know no one ever has the right to exploit  bully  manipulate or mistreat them in any way  I simply didn't fathom this as a child  A little sociopathy goes along way in today's day and age         
 7 for 2 hours  Sorry to hear that man  Is that a rare thing though  I don't know cause I live in a fairly tourist heavy place  I found myself just checking the surge maps throughout today  even though I had no intention of driving  Addicting me  just like a video game  D 
I hate sitting here alone all the time  I feel like I'm wasting my youth away  I'm supposed to be close to people right  Doing things  Having adventures  Every time I try to reach out I feel like I'm an imposter   I really hope it gets better for both of us 
got the copper IUD  no hormones   no risk for higher rates of depression  mood changes  appetite changes etc the cramps are tough but its worth it 
My cats one of my best friends  he's 14  so we've been through the worst together  
Orange cats   best cats  I'm a crazy cat man at 21 already and would have completely given up without kitty  We lay on the floor yesterday together for an hour or so  he was just purring gently  3
Well  there's already been a pretty well documented outbreak of violence against minority groups following the election  In terms of his presidency    I mean  he advocated for so e pretty reprehensible platforms  so I guess it depends on how you feel about mass deportations  national registries  and nuclear proliferation 
This is rape  Nothing else but it  Contact the police  go to the hospital  Tell your parents  You are loved  it isnt your fault  Be strong
Agreed  doesnt even seem like theres room for guess work 
Pretty much every SAers success story  Good for you  I read an article today about how "luck" happens to those who try new things and meet new people  Definitely favors extroverts and well  people who don't stay at home on the weekends  Something for everyone on these boards to keep in mind this new year  incl myself 
In my own experience  I find that when I'm really depressed  I'm always looking at the world in the wrong way  somehow   a little "off " or a little too bleak  I study a lot of philosophy  and one of the things that I notice there is that the clearest thinkers don't really seem to be depressed  but they do seem to be sad  somehow  like they never quite lose sight of things like death  or the impermanence of what they love  a kind of melancholy runs through all of Aristotle  for instance  or through a really lucid poet  like Homer   So I think that's what being "too aware" looks like   a kind of sadness  rather than a kind of hopelessness   though  even with that being said  I'd still rather be too aware than not aware enough 
Holy shit man  This sounds pretty god damn terrible  Really aren't words to express it or the sorrow we feel for you

Has something happened in your past when you were a child  Something that traumatized you    I feel like you are easily influenced by traumatic images  While yes what you saw is traumatic  realize you are now applying something that never has and probably never will happen to your everyday life    You should use the information productively and remember it for educational and safety reasons not so much focusing no the negative impact of it   Hope you find something  I feel ya  
One day at a time  It is an applicable and great thing to remember  Hugs to you OP  Big problems are not as big as they seem  just break them down into manageable chunks  
I feel the same way  I wish I could enjoy my youth but I can't  Everyone else my age is living it up and making memories  I don't think things will get better for me  but I hope they get better for you 
yes   reading before bed does the trick 
I was dying inside for years  so addicted to the thrill of fantasizing about my favorite characters living out amazing passionate lives  I was just like a junky  with stashes of fanfiction hidden around the house  and techniques for pretending to be interacting with people in the real world while actually I was fantasizing the whole time  If only I could have made that euphoric  enthralling feeling keep going and going I would still be doing it  but reality kept kicking me in the face and showing me the heartbreaking mess I was making of my real  one and only  life  For me I just had to stop completely  like alcoholics have to stop drinking completely  I had to do 12 Step recovery program with it  through Escapism   Fantasy Addicts Anonymous  I haven't daydreamed or fantasized compulsively for over 2 years  except for a few short slips   Things are really  really good now   
One day at a time won't work so well in two days when everything comes crashing down on top of me  
Yes  i did try it and I am grateful   it did help me process some past unwanted closeness  rape  and to overcome the compulsivity eventually  I am still doing it   with some memory pictures  imagined or on photo    partly with some abusive fmily members of mine and partly with pictures of body parts  I do believe in it   But for that I had to read some articles on eye movements during dreams    called REM and also about how eye movement and the brain memory center is linked   And Nicolosi mentions left brain and right brain  rational verbality and emotional nonverbality  balancing in this context  which also sounds persuasively 
Definitely  My dogs are the best thing that's happened to me  
I love philosophy too  but ain't a fan of reading    I have a novel that I want to share with the world someday  I'm still working on it  292 pages into it now  87k word count

Have you tried asking your doctor for a full lab work up   My new GP helped find out some deficiencies that have helped some of MY mobility issues   All in all it only cost a 100 bucks  with good insurance I admit  for both the doctor and the lab work   Even then it's a good idea to get regular lab work done if you're concerned about anything in particular  my mom does it for her thyroid too because she's borderline 
I know what you mean  For me I get this feeling like "no you don't deserve that  They only do that out of pity  They don't really love you " It makes me feel like I'm about to be sick or start crying or take off in an airplane  
All I can say is I'm sorry  I'm sorry these feelings exist and I'm sorry they plagued you  I'd love for you to turn around and wait out the storm but if not  goodbye my friend    There's never a bad reason to keep you alive  I remember the first time I watched family guy on Netflix  I told myself wait  just wait until you finish the season  Then wait until you finish the entire show  I have never stopped watching family guy  I think I've watched every episode at least 20 times and by watch I mean play in the background while I do things around the house  Anyways  I hope you find a reason to stay alive  no matter how silly or seemingly insignificant    I'm sorry homie I wish this didn't happen to people  Good luck man  with whatever you choose   
GG to that buddy  Keep it up
I don't know what counselor you mean  I sure had few therapists but to be fair   here there isn't really good professional help in the field of mental illnesses  you're insane  go to asylum  or just have pills and be done with it   that is basically what approach I ever got from doctors  If you mean school counselor  I am really not sure if our colleges have one and don't just relly on outside help 
Also helps me not overthink so much and keeps me in a positive mind set  Stick to the indica strains or higher CBD strains  This is important because strains high in THC can just increase your anxiety  Microdose or in other words take a hit and chill  Good luck

Everyone thinks I'm depressed when I just know more than them  People will always let you down in the end  The world would be uneffected by your passing  People don't love you  the pity you  It's not pessimistic  it's a statement of fact  
Wow that sounds really tough  Good on you for commitment    First off  if you haven't already been  it would be a good idea to get checked out by a doctor  It's great you have a personal trainer  but this could possibly be a red flag for a larger health problem and it's worth exploring   After that  you might try a kind of self experiment  Change one aspect of your workout and see if it still happens  If you work out at someplace besides the gym  does it happen  What about when you do cardio  If you only worked out for fifteen minutes  If you lie down and put your legs up the wall after you cool down  rule out poor blood flow to brain as a causative factor     Like Dr hooha said  are you on any medications or supplements that could be contributing to either anxiety or nausea  esp something like a pre workout supplement  In any case good luck figuring it out  I'm sure there's a way you can work out without this nasty aftereffect   
I'd rather fail knowing I tried  Nobody got to where they are today by being a pessimist  
I know you said not to answer but I talk too much anyway  I'll always come back to here  The rock bottom that I can't fall from  why  Because it's easy  There's no work for simply existing  I'll always come back to my little corner of nothing

Yes that's what goes through my mind as well  Like I don't deserve it  Or like they are only doing it because they have to which makes me push them away even more  Then after that I feel guilty for possibly hurting them   
Hugs first  words can wait      Hugs     Now  for the talking part     Can't begin to imagine how hard it must be for you to acknowledge and live with what happened in your past    That being said  the first part of resolving an emotional trauma is to indeed to acknowledge it  Perhaps one of the reason why it seems so easy for your family to bear the whole burden and why you're experiencing so much trouble is because you're ahead of them  Alone  that is  I'd say you can be flipping proud of that  because you didn't chose the easy way out  You faced what happened  That'll pay  Hang in tough  you're facing the harsh part now  but it'll get better and better from there on     As for a way to get your arse out of the place  perhaps you can contact some former school mates that'd be back with their families around   It would present the advantage to give you someone to chat with that isn't necessary your doctor  You might also want to ask them  the medics  I mean   can't say I know how they're organised  let alone in the US  but I'm fairly sure they've seen this kind of situation before  They may have advice for you

That's why I got a bed heater  It's like a mattress pad but warm  And a body pillow to hold  It's really nice to snuggle into a warm bed with a warm squishy thing to hug  It's especially nice because my room has like zero insulation  and the heat is shitty  It always makes me feel like I'm running closer to the temperature everyone else is  instead of a few degrees colder 
You were raped sweetie  I am so sorry this happened to you  and you need to report this   Keep the texts as proof  screenshot and save them  If you have any clothes from that night save them  Do not wash them  IT can be used as proof   I am so sorry  Don't listen to them  sweetie  and take care of yourself and report this  Stay strong  3
I feel pretty much the same way  The pettiest of things will go wrong like an awkward conversation  and walking away from it I'll just feel like I don't deserve my own existence  I'm not sure if I'm one to say anything  because I've never had the balls to do something like you did  but I feel as if it was justified  If these people do that every weekend  and you've been content through all that shit  then you have every right to such a simple request  Don't let people get to you  I know damn well it's hard af  but if you can just realize that such an event is insignificant and miniature it helps  Best wishes for you 
Ok will do thanks
Go by yourself  dude   I went to see The Force Awakens by myself and it was an amazing experience  Once the movie starts  it's just you and the film  That's it  You can lose yourself fully and bathe in the world illuminated on the screen  It's fantastic   I too was nervous about going to the theater by myself   and there is absolutely no reason to be  No one gives a damn  they're there for the movie either with people or by themselves    You'll be fine  
Good luck  I wish for your peace  dead or alive 
I remember yesterday I had an anxiety attack and was scared of driving  I was basically driving drunk  I took the easiest route possible with all protected left turns and no tight streets etc    Earlier this year I had an anxiety attack and my friend looked at me and stopped me and told me I had been stumbling all over the place as we were walking  He grabbed me by my armpits because he thought I would fall over  He didn't understand it and neither did I at the time    A week ago I was taking a customer's order when I had another attack and I started mumbling and saying the wrong words and slurring my words  It was really bad  My boss happened to be there at the time because we were understaffed for how built it was and asked if I would like her to take over  I walked into the back and sat down for 30 seconds  I didn't take another order all shift and we never talked about it after  I think she understood     Yup anxiety sucks sometimes homie unfortunately it comes at bad times where you should be the most functional    I can definitely relate  Push through it my friend  
Sure thing  I added ya
Nothing great to add  Sorry to say but denial is the first step  Also try use the time you have now to enjoy what might be your last moments  I would wait out thinking of the future  I'm sorry to hear about your circumstance  hope someone has something better but if you need support message me  
First off take a few deep breaths and relax  Slow things down a bit  Your mom doesn't hate you  Think about all of the times she has loved you and then argue with your intrusive thoughts  They dont control you  Your mom is not going to hate you over your preference of video game  
I know this is a weird question  but how much sleep do you get  Also  do you feel your thoughts racing 
I guess what I was saying is that saying that you can have SA even if it's minor  It doesn't have to be typified if you don't want it to  you kind of make my point when I said language puts constraints on thought   Yes it's a problem when you have more extreme forms of it   which it doesn't seem like OP has  but to say that "pretending" everyone has it  that's where I don't understand where you're coming from  You said you agreed with me yet you also say my thinking is an excuse   All I meant to say is that instead of thinking that you don't fit in with other people because of your insecurities  you can get some comfort from knowing that everyone has this feeling  SA or not 
The way you feel about drawing is the way I feel about writing  especially when I read how excellent people my age  older and younger too   are compared to me 
It hurts when someone doesn't quite understand  especially when it's someone you expect to  I also know what it's like to feel like a burden    Over the past couple of years or so I've tried to focus on forgiving other people  as well as myself  I don't like to talk about my trauma  but when I do the reactions are rarely as strong as I'd expect  I think the people I've told don't know how to best handle it  so they do their best to show they care with the "oh  I'm sorry" routine   I also try to remember that my trauma is unique to my psyche  biology  and upbringing   what happened and how I feel is valid and important  This helps me feel like less of a burden   As for your doctor visits   I've totally been there  too  Sometimes I'm very honest  sometimes I don't give every detail for fear of the repercussions  Again  I try to forgive myself when this happens and remain optimistic that this is a healing process  It takes time    I still believe I'm a better  stronger person despite all that's happened 
Thanks a lot I will definitely do that   
I took the same dosage for a little over a month and it would help when I took it but my tolerance began to build and long term it made my anxiety tremendously worse  and it was miserable trying to get off of it  to the point of not being able to leave the house for days    Everyone's different though I suppose  I agree that it's probably best to use it as a "safety net" of sorts  
I know you might not find this very helpful since you seem to have been through a lot  but you can talk to me if you want  I've been close to suicide as well but after a long time of suffering I know that things will start to get better  even though it might seem very slow at first 
Absolutely no one  Except one person at work  
I know what you mean  The last 6 years of my life felt like someone else was controlling me and now I'm just waking up and having to live in the mess they created   
Me too  
What do you mean by 'even science is the meaning'   I'm talking about the Big Rip  and no I'm not aware that it's outdated  Dark matter might hold the key to further refined answers   I wouldn't say I've got things figured out  I'm just saying this is what I know  and I agree that we are insignificant  I mean  I'm a fan of Cosmicism  And I'm also aware that humans can never attain the ultimate truth give that we are so limited with our ability to observe 
You're not an awful human being  You know why  Because you realized you made a mistake  came clean about it and apologized  Now only that  you come on here to berate yourself and go hard on your own slip up when you did not have to   The very fact that you're on here posting about this shows how sorry you are and that you are a good person   Calm down  we all make mistakes like this more often than not  You're not a bad person  At all 
That's a very good question  one that I often ponder the answer to  I often think if I was stupid and a bit of a gullible idiot  would I be so sad  Interesting point though  nice to know I am not the only one 
Stress can cause ulcers  Irritation can cause ulcers  Many things can cause ulcers  Just because you have an ulcer does not mean you are deathly I'll  Avoid acidic foods for a while  be nice to your tummy  
I have PTSD and DP but it's not gonna be forever  It's a temporary road block  One day the bunnies will hop  I'm nearly 26 and expected to be touring the world as a musician  was loosing my mind till Fall Out Boys engineer said man I didn't do anything till my mid 30s  looks around at packed arena show   You are young  Nothing's forever  Work on you first  Things will come if you work at them inch by inch 
Hello friend  want to talk  What happened 
Did anything happen in your life that seemed to trigger it 
I've always been an introvert  and a lot of social interaction stresses me out and tires me easily  Perhaps not talking to others isn't ideal by society's standards  but it has to be okay  Some of us need a break from the inundation of small talk  It isn't imperative to talk to people  especially if you don't want to    That being said  it's good to have people there for you  I talk to only my closest friends when I'm anxious and stressed  and sometimes that helps  
I get where you are coming from  I often think "I wish that I had the desire to self harm again"  Slightly different I know  From what you say about not having anyone to lean on  it's almost as if one half of your brain could be hinting to the other half about suicide yet the other half not agreeing    If that makes sense  Basically in answering your question  yes   it does make sense 
   good    What kind of character and campaign are you playing  Are you a player character or the DM 
 removed 
Thank you 
There is no multiplicative nature to radiation exposure and your phone  You will be fine 
Try deactivating facebook  its a subconscious mindfuck that can make you depressed 
Yes  They actually have made really weighed blankets for anxiety and depression for this reason   
Same way dude  I'm a senior and I really regret not getting help my freshman  junior years  Dude get help it's never too late  Also  you know those people who drop out of college but still end up rich  Yeah this is probably why  Anyways  get help dude and don't worry too much about your future  it'll work itself out    My suggestion  where do you live  In LA  you can go to a community college for three years and USC for two and graduate with a masters  That's shorter than going to USC freshman year masters and you get the same degree for cheaper    Bottom line  it'll work out  You will most likely transfer to a good college eventually if you are smart and have all of your shit sorted out 
Hello friend  sorry to hear you're having a hard time    What kind of job do you have now  What's your living situation 
I ask my wife to do stuff like this but I don't think she understands  I get crazy anxiety that I'm going to sound like an idiot or fuck something up  You're not alone  
Just had this happen  water helped  Caffeine helped a bit  Sleep cured it  but then its a new day to get a headache 
I like to think that I am a realist aware  but I'm probably just depressed as shit    It's probably both to some degree  
Hello everyone  I've had anxiety for a long time  I guess   Probably since early childhood  May have come from a stressful overbearing and heavily controlled upbringing combined with constant bullying in school  or somewhere else   I don't know   I don't necessarily think mine is all that terrible   I have random panic attacks that wake me up on rare occasions  a few times a year  tops   and anxiety attacks while dealing with triggers  driving places i'm not certain about  phone calls to non friends family  anything super official legal  and walking alone in the dark   or traveling alone in general I guess   But aside from the rare breakdowns when I don't take my vitamins and get the idea that everyone secretly hates me  i'm naturally lacking in vit D  sadly   my day to day life is pretty easy i'd say  and anxiety stays pretty mild   But anxiety is still anxiety  and in the absence of any other ideas  my doctor says it must be the cause of my physical disabilities  Recently was put on Zoloft but had such severe side effects that I only lasted 3 days on it before I mustered up the nerve to call my doc and she told me I needed to stop taking it right away  So  That was something     My anxiety plan involves trying to strengthen my body  and therefore my confidence  as much as I reasonably can with better workout ethic this year   so far successful  11 miles biked yesterday  5 today   I also plan on trying to schedule a few therapy appointments before my insurance runs out in less than 4 months    I have to try to psych myself up for doing that tomorrow so I can get in    I do wonder if poor sleep could be part of my issue  I tend to take hours to fall asleep and wake up at least once during the night   This year   I intend to finish the book i'm writing  I also hope I can go visit my friend in another state  but that would require going to some of the busiest airports in the country alone   One of my worst nightmares       If only I could teleport  haha   
Do it  It helps  A lot  Like   A   Lot    Haha  For real  Best decision i made  Probably need to head back  
Wowzers that is so awesome  brings a smile to my face   eugh if only I had an NA account to play on i would definitely play with you   norms is legit  as you said LoL is life  ez game  ez life    Fantastic to hear  I wish you all the best     you go grill 
Hello friend  sorry to hear you're having a hard time   I remember being a Junior in high school  Apart from applying to grad school  it was one of the most stressful times in my life  As a 32 year old man now with a bit of perspective  I can say this  my depression and stress as a high schooler was a bit out of proportion to that actual threat level   What's most important right now is your mental health  Have you talked to your parents about this  Are you getting any professional help right now    It might seem crazy to think about  but you might want to take a semester or year off school  In the grand scheme of things  that extra time might save your life  and it won't cost you that much   Good luck
What exactly should one practice though  I have attempted to initiate small talk with both male and female  and people literally speak their last words while running away from me 
Go to a psychologist and find the right one till you get an answer  Your post meets many things from normal human emotions to Cyclothymia to anxiety  It's hard in a post to know  All I will say is if it's effecting your day to day life there is a problem  Get help and not from a doctor 
Me too    Everyone who knows me already sees me as inferior and subhuman and below them  but if they knew I was actively seeking therapy and the specific thoughts going through my mind  they'd probably try to kill me or at least cut me out of their lives  
Hey friend  thanks for sharing your story  Would you be willing to share your video or your writing    Confidence comes from repeatedly being in challenging situations and getting through them  If you have lost confidence in yourself  I am certain you can build it back    What do you like to write about  
lol awkward girls are deemed cute and playful  Awkward guys are deemed weak 
If its a combination of antidepressants or extremely high dose you could have serotonin sickness  this is no joke  Very dangerous call someone 
That is most definitely rape call the police and tell your parents
i wake up every night around 3am feeling like i can't breathe  i'm saving up for a weighted blanket  if my boyfriend is next to me  he rolls over and lays across the chest  i've never been a great sleeper but the night anxiety is a direct result of my job  i've started having panic ridden dreams as well  my boss is unpredictable and often makes me feel inadequate for things that were out of my control  he's also petty and passive aggressive to the point when other employees have to stop him and tell him to let it go and stop bothering me with stuff   as in made a small mess up that i rectified immediately with no further issues two months ago and he still teases me about it    anyway  my therapist suggested i try taking my medication in the morning instead of at night  we think it might be waking me up when the slow release pill starts releasing    my suggestion   if you can't handle the stress and it's making your life miserable  there is no shame in trying to find something else   something you can do with pride and that will not affect you like this  
Oh I see  Thank you for explaining 
We're terribly sorry for your loss  but this belongs in  r SuicideBereavement rather than here   
Oh man  Zoloft was awful for me and I only tried it 3 days before my doctor told me I needed to stop right away  Those side effects   Unbearable  I just rocked back and forth all day and stared at a screen  accomplishing far less than I otherwise would have       Never trying SSRIs again  lol   I seem to be having some luck and controlling anxiety with my multivitamin   an additional vitamin D chew as well as daily exercise  I've also been thinking about getting some kind of calming scent plugin for my bedroom  Maybe something like these ideas would work for you   Would recommend not getting high anymore  though  Some people say marijuana helps  but at least as many say it hurts  increases their anxiety  
Story sounds similar  I know what you are going through  Depression is a very personal journey  Even meds  what works for one doesn't work for others  Hence why to some people depression is this thing that you just "go out and do stuff" and everything's sweet  Explore your avenues  Hang in there and message me if you wanna talk 
It's a Mozda  It's beautiful and it was a gift  The exact color I wanted and drives so smooth   Please do not ever do what I did  Even if you're pissed off and you're aware you haven't eaten  drive safely    I haven't stopped crying since it happened yesterday 
Hello friend  thanks for sharing your story   My advice is to spend time with your dad  worry about your mom after  Yes  she'll probably want to lean on you for support for a while  and you shouldn't put any time limit on it  But  your mom loves you too  and she wants you to have your own life  
People always keep saying you just need more practice  even professionals like therapists  but unfortunately there is no manual to practice by  and you rarely get a clean social slate in your adulthood   It's incredibly awkward when you start chatting up people all of sudden when they all know you're an awkward loner 
Thanks so much for your advice  Very helpful   I just don't really get your definition of narcissism  I can't really comprehend it  Sorry   Anyway I will  Thanks for the concern   Edit  Do you mean taking things personally 
This was such a lovely kind hearted post  i'd really like to know what rule was broken  c
 unless they're considered ugly
Ugly women have choices of men after them  including attractive men  just less of them than average or above women   They choose their loneliness 
I didn't know about that sub  thanks 
I feel like I dream of how my life could be better    I really want it to be   but the thought of me being "happy" is so foreign because I've never been happy before  I feel like it'd be a completely different me and it scares me    The way I currently live  my beliefs that is  seem completely idiotic and ridiculous to me  even though I have trouble denying that they are true  
It explain why I never got the happit of brushing teeth 
Just installed the app  it's great   Thanks
Jealous    My anxiety automatically cancels me out of the dating world  No guy would  or should basically  want to date a nervous  depressed  weirdo like me  
I guess if mental health issues are such a big part of one's life  it is hard to envisage a life without them  I mean we don't know anything different right   I personally think that depression and other things have completely ruined my life to every degree  I reckon I could have been a pilot  or a football player or a scientist   You name it  I could have done it  I was one of  those  kids teenagers    People often say to me "you are not your illness"  However  that's not true as mental health stuff is all I have to talk about  I am deeply ashamed of who I am today and I have no sense of identity or belonging     Bit negative tbh yet that's my story haha 
Playing a Goliath paladin and we are playing the elemental evil campaign 
Yup    Every day I think I'm going to be fired  I suck up at work so hard and never stand up for myself  I don't ever want to cause conflict and let everyone trample over me so they won't get me in trouble    I don't know how it's possible to maintain a career and a job and how people do it    I was fired twice last year  
Man I've got hardly any hair on my crown but no one knows  The one secret  thickening hair spray  Like spray on hair basically  Pm if you wanna know what one  But no girl has ever noticed  Some of my friends thought my hair regrew magically till I told them lol  Honesty if you get this you'll never think about it again  Problem solved  I swear 
Most definitely you have to go to the hospital  contact your parents and the police  You might say you feel confused or scared but in no question you're not at fault  
What you described is rape  
I hope so too  I'm sorry for your loss  I know mine doesn't compare  it still hurts though  I really mean my congratulations though  I truly hope you win the war  Depression is just plain unfair  It's good to know people still care about us though  that helps  I hope you get another two tomorrow  I'm proud of you  
Huh    that's interesting  Sounds a little similar to my situation  Might take a look into that group  p 
Just some feedback for you  You do realize that when you quarantine a certain type of post to a different sub  it's going to get less views than on the main sub  right   r depression has 150K subscribers   r SuicideBereavement has 1 6K  so about 1    I'm just curious  what was the reasoning behind this  I will of course respect the rules of this sub  Just wondering 
Well you said about becoming like your mum and not being able to feel guilt or remorse right  That's impossible for anxious people because our senses of guilt and remorse for things we haven't even done minor issues are already off the scales  The losing touch of reality becoming cynical and not caring about things is part of the depression that comes with OCD and anxiety disorders  It's like a protective screen that stops us from going into overdrive all the time  All the worries you have about being narcissistic or not caring about people are being reinforced in your mind by the physical symptoms of your anxiety but you aren't narcissistic because you're aware that your anxiety is affecting you in this way  does that make sense

You are a sovereign consciousness who has every right to exist  If others try to make you think otherwise  berate you  degrade you  they are wrong  Not you 
I can kind of relate  like one time some guy flipped me off and yelled fuck you while driving  and i told myself if he stopped by this one public store i would confront him and just ask him why i did  felt really proud and posted to FB  everyone just told me how bad of an idea it was  like sure i could have been beat up  but like  i was just made to feel like shit for standing up for myself  i dont do it nmuch because i usually lose whatever argument or situation it is  and feel like ill lose the relationship because its not as important to them  so i just shut up   LET YOURSELF FEEL GOOD
Have you got your hormones checked out yet  Alot of these issues can stem from hormonal imbalances 
Women choose that by going out with abusive alpha males  
Not a slut  You were raped  Go make a police report please 
Thanks for the hope  Glad to hear you are out the rabbit hole 
It makes me wonder how those sorts of people actually get anywhere in life   I've gotten so angry from being treated like how you describe above that I have smashed things and hurt myself quite badly before  It's a double edged sword  if we stay and keep talking to them we feel like we are being used and abused  If we leave then we have no one to talk to  or less people to talk to  
That's not true      
Hello friend  sorry to hear you're having a rough time  It sounds like you're still having some unresolved guilt about your grandmother  and now with your aunt I definitely get that it would be overwhelming    When my grandfather was on his deathbed  my Mom called me to let me know  I asked her if I should fly home  I had my finger on the buy button for plane tickets  but she said not to worry about it  He died that night  So  I can sympathize with your feelings   When does school start for you  Can you take more time off  Do you got a support structure around you  Who else have you talked to about this 
I guess it depends on the medication and the dosage  I've used three different antidepressants and I never struggled with not being able to cry or express emotions  
Fuck your family  Religion is no excuse to shun family    Never undervalue your brother  him standing up for you is brave of him 
haHAA ty  Im one of the only girls who actually hates playing support lol  It's just not fun to me  But hey  at least i get to stream as well so perks  P
I'm a guy   and I'd be happy to be your friend  I've been looking for a friend I can depend on like that as well    
Yeah I've had similar thoughts dreams before   I see them mourning over my dead body broken in tears for days  and a week later I'm almost forgotten  another week or two and I'm rarely remembered  
You don't take any medications  I could imagine how hard it would be to not be on medication to function  I take medication and it helps me tremendously  Only down side of it for me is hire difficult it is to climax during sex  Though I'm sure my wife doesn't mind    Keep up with your job though and schedule a doctor's appointment  I think you'll find that with medication it makes things much easier and can keep the constant worrying at bay easier    Remind yourself that you have done this for a year and nothing bad has come of it  Every time I have to head into the city I'm uncomfortable even with medication  But the worst case scenario within reason   of me visiting the city is better than living a closed off life    We're all rooting for you  You've made progress moving forward  Just because it's not easy doesn't mean you should move backwards  
I think you're stressing out without reason  you see  if she likes you  it's not that important how you say it and she'll be glad  if she doesn't  no matter how you say it  it's not gonna make her like you and the information will be communicated and she might feel awkward  oh well  that's the way things are if you plan on telling her   if I should give you any advice  I'd say be yourself  just be your natural self  either you're loved for who you are  or you're not  and if it should unfortunately go south  love yourself enough to know that you will find somebody better  who actually feels the same way about you as you do about them   I'm going to go on a trip with a girl I like soon  my way of talking is making a lot of jokes  showing wit  analyzing her and situations in fun way  etc  so I drop "hints" that are kinda obvious  make the whole thing fun and since she's into me  she responds positively  we're having a good time  after the hint joke part I just got serious and express my feelings very bluntly and we talked openly about it and things are going great  this is not advice on how you should do it  I just wanna tell you that being natural and confident is the most important thing  next to valuing yourself and understanding that the potential loss is in no way related to your worth or whatever  I know I'm talking about this more broadly then what was in your question  but either way  if you're gonna risk it  don't stress  be yourself  it's wise to prepare for both scenarios  I wish you good luck man 
Yes  More so the driving   I'll usually end up convincing myself that I hit someone or ran over someone as I'm driving  and just can't "remember" it clearly  And so I'll come up an image from my imagination of me hitting someone to obsses on whether or not I did it   It's a rough time  But the anxiety will go away if you fight it enough 
Hey crimson i like to help people and i wanna learn english completely so my english isnt good but if you wanna help me and feel alone just pm me    20 male from Turkey
Hello friend    That's the bitch of depression  it's a disease with no known cure  only treatment  and the things that trigger a depressive episode might not be based in reality  Even people who have a great life "on paper" can be diagnosed  just look at Robin Williams et al   You're seeking help  and you started medicating  so that's a step in the right direction  All I can offer is  don't get discouraged if your meds don't help as much as you think they should  Keep working with your doctor to tweak your prescription or try different meds  And keep in mind  the meds will never "cure" you  but they might make it so that instead of staying in bed all day  for example   you muster enough motivation to get up and go to the gym  etc    Good luck friend
The only way to fix depression would be to remove the emotion  the hurt    and we need that  The best thing is to find balance    peace   
Don't internalize the guilt  Your ex wasn't good for you  there was nothing you could do to fix that situation  Focus on improving and respecting yourself  No one deserves to be treated as a lesser person  You are a human being who deserves love  Spend time with people where you feel it the most  
I guarantee you aren't alone   in any of the "weird" things you feel think  or "bad" habits    Procrastination is one of the biggest symptoms of depression  but not really commonly known     Obviously it's good if we do all the things we should every day   but for a lot of us that isn't realistic just yet    Don't try to "fix" everything at once  we are more likely to fail and that is likely to make us get more depressed    Doing like OP and starting with one basic thing and creating a habit is the way to go   then we get the pride of succeeding  the knowledge we CAN succeed  and find it is enjoyable  It makes us feel better about ourselves  even just a little  and can motivate us to take another step    Start with small  easily attainable goals for each day  Even if it is a list that can be completed in 10 minutes   it is still a list of accomplishments to check off  and still is something to reflect on at the end of the day    No Zero Days  look that up online   there are a few write ups about the concept     We don't have to do it all at once   we just need to at least one little thing each day  The rest will follow    Don't worry  there are a TON of us    
I feel guilt   not because everything they try to do for me or give but just because it seems like I don't deserve what they offer   if that makes sense 
Receive hugs is a better option 
I got led on twice in the same way    And now I just keep getting rejected 
Wow  180 is super high  I'm freaked out at my lowly 130s  haha  I never did because it settled down after a few days  Back to a gentle 95  bpm  But it's definitely a stimulant  I slept for 5 5 hrs  night for a whole month  My hands still shake  Sometimes my legs shake when I'm sitting down    Yeah  I'm the same with standing up  It's weird  I got a check up a week ago and everything is healthy  I just have a really high heart rate  I ran track in hs and everything  and I'm considered fitter than a number of my friends  Less sedentary too   Ok  Depending on the day  When I'm good  I like to go out  
My relationship ended because of my depression  I can somewhat understand  Let me just tell you two years down the line it gets a lot easier  for me it's no longer daily which you can't imagine right now  My advice is try and win her back because if it doesn't happen  and you can never make something work one sided  the strength you have inside  you've got it bro  will come out fighting  you are still holding onto this  It's terrible advice but end the chapter by closing it  Someone can't be your life partner if they can't be there at the bottom  For better or for worse right  Depression is part of life  Don't blame yourself  If you ever even think of attempting something message me or ring a help line 
I feel like they have to be sick of me  Ive been leaning on some people  hard  I am scared sometimes to be alone  I have had very bad anxiety and I know being depressed all the time has to be boring to be around  I tell myself all the things youve said and just hope someday i believe them  Everything is so surreal in a sad way  it feels like he died  or something in me died  I wish he cared that i hurt so much
Holy fuck Irish     From MinerAP   Dude do you remember Highson and blubrani    
Human support is nice knowing that you aren't alone sometimes  My life recipe is as following  pc   tv   pet   family  Anything else can f off lol  My personal goal is to create my own family someday  even if if seems impossible sometimes     
Absolutely tell your parents  I let it slip one day and I thought it was the worst day of my life  but now I'm getting help 
great
sounds good to me
Controlling relationships aren't healthy  It's not uncommon to see a controlling partner take advantage of another partner that needs them more than they need the other person  Whether it be money  a place to stay or emotional support  Not having a place to go is awful but that also gives him much more power over you  Staying with someone because you have no place else to go is a terrible reality for many people  You made the right decision for yourself  Stay strong  If you need a friend to talk to send me a pm  My lifes not perfect either  and I need a pen pal myself  
  I was stalking my old friends    Yeee  wassup

What happened to you illustrates why kids need to be   taught to not rape      Getting you drunk for the purpose of getting some pleasure or something out of another human being is rape  This is why kids need to be taught about consent in early life so using another person's body without explicit and non intoxicated permission is rape  We could teach consent because our bodies belong to us and us alone  If anyone wants to argue about giving consent while intoxicated  r philosophy and  r feminism have gone over the definitions and arguments the basics several times  This sub here is not the place to discuss philosophy  rest assured  though  philosophy logic provides  clear and cogent  https   www reddit com r philosophy comments wojl9 why is intoxication a basis for inability to   reasons about why and how wrong these victim blamers are     In addition  there are clear and cogent reasons why kids under  18 cannot give consent  Chief among them is what scientists have learned about the teenage brain  http   harvardmagazine com 2008 09 the teen brain htmlhttps   www sciencenewsforstudents org article teenage brain  that's the  science end of it  however  these relatively   new   findings are  PDF  impacting the legal world  https   www google com url sa t rct j q  esrc s source web cd 9 ved 0ahUKEwj1ob6 vaXRAhWmwFQKHXj0B3wQFghRMAg url http 3A 2F 2Fnjdc info 2Fwp content 2Fuploads 2F2015 2F10 2FBrain Science and the Theory of Juvenile Mens Rea docx usg AFQjCNHVKA9ikmivNm7hHDEhKvX6pEANtw sig2 zQuJQurbt6um 4bM7vKW8w  as well  http   clbb mgh harvard edu juvenilejustice  http   www childtrends org how brain science is changing juvenile justice sentencing   http   issues org 28 3 steinberg   
I'm sorry for what you've been through  What you've been through is incredibly rough and you are very brave for facing it  What nobody tells you about abuse is that it's ok to mourn the good parts of the person  It doesn't make you weak  stupid  or sick  You're grieving the loss of what you had  what was done to you  and what you wish you had  You wish you could isolate and keep the good parts about him and that is absolutely understandable and normal  I'm proud of you for taking steps to make sure you are physically and emotionally safe by going to therapy and getting a restraining order because you can't change him no matter how hard you try  He has to change himself  All you can do is work on healing   What coping skills do you have  If you don't have many this would be a good time for you to talk to your therapist about different ways of coping  I know for me finding ways to express the trauma and get emotional support helped  Do you have any supportive friends or family you can talk to  I know that for me writing  drawing  painting  and collaging really helped me emotionally get out my feelings of the trauma  You may find that books about trauma and healing are also validating to your experience  You deserve healing  happiness  and justice and I hope you continue to move forward in your healing process  
I did that with Skyrim

It's not a small thing    It's like the saying "the straw that broke the camel's back"   one little piece of straw wouldn't break its back by itself  but when it's that last one  that 'little straw' is pretty big    Think of your situation as the reverse  Someday when you are on top of the world  you'll look back on this small thing and smile because the end effect of this small thing was so huge   Awesome job    
If you are an attractive woman you aren't doomed to be alone  regardless of how bad your depression is  Even if you have no will to socialize you can still find someone  That's not the case for males 
You were raped  and it was ENTIRELY NOT your fault  NOTHING you did makes it your fault  You were drunk and COULD NOT consent  Go to the police now and report them 
Yea I get the same feeling anytime someone's nice to me  I'll be greeted with a hug and "I'm glad to see missed you" and all I can manage is a blank stare in return  I just don't know how to process positive feedback from other people cause I'm so used to bing shit on  
this exact thing happened to me too and it fucking sucks  I'm so sorry they did this to you  its the worst feeling 
I can feel hopeless out of nothing and cry the rest of the night  It's weird and disturbing  when I told my psychologist she said that I should also mention it to my psychiatrist to see if it could   should be fixed with meds
I feel you op  I come and go in this sub  Just reading about other people's experiences has made me feel less crazy  and if I'm able to help others a bit  then that's good for everyone  The other thing that this sub has provided me is perspective  I see a lot of the same things over and over  and through that I understand my own depression better   We're happy you're here  But if you want to leave  don't worry about it 
Thank you for your kind words  they really resonated with me   You had some really good advice that I will keep in mind   You're right  I shouldn't let the negativity get to me  and focus more on the positives in my life   I appreciate it  thanks once again 
I have 3 options  1 Stay with my boyfriend and continue another year of toxic behavoir and constant fighting 2 Leave him and be completely isolated and lonely since i actually no friends and no idea how to make any 3  Kill myself to get out of the situation Have been feeling more and more fonder of the last choice recently
I went to one for years and it really helped me    it's ok    truly  it's ok
I miss MinerAP      And not much man  finally started college  hate it  I'm growing titties and I couldn't be happier  I live every single day in existential horror wishing I owned a gun and I now play a fuck ton of CSGO  What's up with you homie    Also oh god my post history will scar you  Sort my posts by Top and see if you can find my WTF post from like two years ago

Hi there  I'm new to this Subreddit  I've dealt with anxiety for a long time  I was on citalopram for a little while but went off it cold turkey  stupid thing to do   and have been trying to deal with my anxiety without medication or therapy  which I went to for a few months but stopped due to expense   Sometimes I feel on top of it all  other times really not  At the moment my anxiety levels have been up quite a bit  night time before bed can be the worst  I'm looking forward to chatting with you all  and hope we can all help each other    
Ugh I feel completely the same about literally everything you just described  The difference being that I oscillate between "the shitty norm" down to "abysmal " Years of this has made me not want to even sit back and ride the shitty norm days when I don't feel super terrible  because I know it's just going to hit hard again out of nowhere    Like I'm scared to let myself enjoy things bc I know how terrible it feels to get that capability taken away suddenly  I don't even have anything helpful to say just that I feel you and it's fucking ridiculous   depressing in itself       And everything you said about relationships   obligations towards people  yea  I feel that completely  too  all the time  And I agree  fuck that      You've got a friend in me if you ever need to vent xx  3
Hey friend  thanks for this  Any advice on how to induce crying  I feel sad but also emotionally constipated  Thanks

You can be lonely in a relationship  you can't be alone and being alone is worse  At least in the situation OP is talking about  doomed to be alone   involuntarily being alone for a long time  forever 
Try again 
The fastest way would be to cut off all contact  But it's also the hardest one I guess

I actually was just on it tonight  I was looking my old messages  saw a conversation between us about our base being griefed and Outpost Squid  and it led me here   Yeah  I'm in college  too  Computer Science degree and all of that jazz  I am also not a fan of it   I saw that you were trans   I'm glad that you're comfortable with your identity  I'm not LGBT  myself but I do consider myself an ally   I play a multitude of games  now  Civ 6  Pokemon S M  Overwatch  Dead by Daylight  Ace Attorney       I'm also a fan of Undertale and FNAF but I swear I'm not like the rest   
Yeah  that's fair enough  I know people are not in competition intentionally  I think the titles of the posts when you often read the front page just read like the headlines of a newspaper  but I have posted 'headline's' in the past here so I'm not judging   I'm glad the sub exists and I'm glad it is so active but I feel it is a double edged sword for some people  like myself   
"Chandelier" is a great one by the same artist  It captures the self destructive feelings perfectly  
Yes I find it rather annoying 
And exposing the main cohort of  r depression to messages of this type is both irrelevant and distressing     Irrelevant  Suicidality and depression are entirely separate issues   They are often comorbid  but although depression is positive correlated with suicidal thought  it's negatively correlated with suicidal  behaviour      Distressing   This type of message is basically salt in the psychological wounds of those who feel that there is no one who cares about them    
Don't EVER let a woman  or any human being for that matter  control your emotional frame of mind 
I just looked into this  I never knew it was actually something   I thought it was just an active imagination    Thanks for sharing this with everyone

how so  
Hey dude  I started with 2 also  I heard in a LifeProTips to do like 15 pushups a day would make my body look better  I've managed to do 2  and I was super sore in the other day haha  I'm still VERY skinny  but now I'm able to do 30  I still do it everyday  D
Do you know where to get one 
Those brief spikes sound much more like inaccuracies in data collection then actual changes in HR  
Thanks for your reply  My therapist has mentioned that triangle and I am currently pulling away from it   Meditation was something taught to me from a young age as part of the religion my family prescribes to  I think it's one of the things that kept me sane through everything  Unfortunately it's heavily associated with the family so I can find it difficult to focus on it without my mind wandering to darker corners  I really should try it again though 
Everyone I talked to who had it said they lost at LEAST 5 pounds in the first few weeks going off of it  I'm scared I'm stuck at this weight and am going to have to work super hard to get it off now     
 big hug       Thank you for responding  I don't have any former schoolmates that I'm comfortable with  but I called my psychologist and am talking with her tomorrow over the phone  I don't think there is a way for me to be away from my family besides waiting the 6 days till my flight back  I'm in Australia  but the state I'm currently in has a terrible health system setup and don't help unless you're actively dying in front of them  I just have to hang on for 6 days  and see what my psychologist says tomorrow  Thanks again  you're very kind
  I don't follow     I get that  
This was beautiful and very relatable 
It also entirely depends on what form the lead is in the clay  You can play with liquid lead all day with your hands and have no increase in the amount of lead in or body  This is because in several forms lead cannot be absorbed easily through the skin  Ingestion or in certain chemicals you can get absorption through the skin  but these are highly regulated and they likely wouldn't be able to legally sell them for use on skin    
From my experience with my depression often you need to go to the source of your depression and that may mean looking at specific areas of your life you need to work on  Identifying the source of the pain which leads to the feelings is difficult and in my experience needs either years of introspection or a very good professional in real life   Maybe this sub is like a gateway  a top level where you acknowledge you have an illness  You make your way from here to somewhere more specific and deeper where you can work on the specific problems and try and fix and improve them   One example for me  r stopdrinking which helped me to have 3 months off drinking last year but also that community helped shed a light on my addictive behaviour  yes I'm drinking again but with open eyes and realisation that it compounds my depression  Maybe others may need help with grief or money  I suppose those that don't know what the problem is may have more soul searching to do here and in real life     It's an interesting predicament this condition puts you in  Thanks for the response  Any thoughts on answers 
Pretty much me to I just end up staying sad mostly even during really good happy moments that I have  I may have a small smile very short  but I end up always staying sad cause I know it's coming anyway so I'm just stuck in unhappy sad mode or whatever you wanna call it
I agree with these posts  you were taken advantage of  Its gonna be a tough pill to swallow so go easy on yourself  Go easy on yourself and speak with the police and speak with some loved ones  
Thanks for the response   I am very content by myself  I have been "alone" for the majority of my life  and preferred it that way for awhile   The issue I face now is that I am not happy with the same old life routine  and whenever I try to change it I feel like I just shoot myself in the foot   I do care about myself and that's  why  I am unhappy   I feel like every time I try to save myself life is like  "nope  not today "  I do not live in an area that is healthy or good for my development  All of my friends have moved away because they'd experienced the same feelings while they were living here   I know the only way to save myself from feeling like shit is to move   I've sold my house in order to move  so it isn't like I'm all talk and no action  I know moving is my only hope   I don't need a girl to be happy  I have been happy absent of relationships   Just at a point in life where it is very clear to me that life would be easier and more fulfilling with someone who cared about me  so I took a chance at trying to open my heart to someone   And that was the point of my referencing this in my first post   It was another example at how I tried to give positivity a chance and it backfired   I am not one of those people who think they need a girl to be happy  that's all bull shit   People should be able to function by themselves  you can't rely on another person to make you happy   But when you are content alone and then let someone into an intimate part of yourself  and then you realize that maybe they are being dishonest in some ways  well  it hurts   Makes you sad  Makes you depressed   It happens   Essentially  sitting here living in this shit hole of a state wasting my youth away is frustrating to me  and I feel like I have failed myself   Life is short and I want to enjoy it  preferably with a girl   As of now  I have no idea where I'll move   Still trying to figure that one out  I just know it's the best idea that is a doorway to a healthy future   In the meantime  my battle is trying to deal with the negative people in my current situation but it's taking it's toll on me and I'm not sure how much patience I have in me before I just blow up   This is my big mountain right now    trying to stay calm in the midst of absolute stupidity

It's so good that you're coming out the other side  but I understand your fear  It's a big change  It's definitely a good thing  but your mind may take a while to figure that out  Stick with it and keep on climbing 
A life surrounded by nothing but pets would be a good life  I think  Animals are dope  On the other side  though  I've got some great family members who are just fantastic people and the only reason I'm sticking around  I think it's great to have a pet  or pet  s    to find comfort in  but I think you should also find an awesome person or two as well    Not to keep them as pets   but just as friends     possibly even in a romantic relationship   Humans are generally greedy a holes with no empathy at all  but even if only 20  of humans on earth are worth the air they breathe  that's still a lot of good people out there doing their best  Just gotta weed through all the jerks 
It only takes a few friends to be stoked about every day of your life  just put in enough hard work and and embarassment to find a few  Being lonely is less likely than being someone with a few really good friends  Once you have them  fuck everyone else lol
Yeah  but it's weird how it's different with other people  like I still remember a bomb ass hug I got from a guy friend that was honestly like the best thing ever
I'm basically the exact same way  I've tried so many different jobs  each time I start it and for a few months I'm like "oh ok this is alright I could handle this" and then after 6 months I'm sick of it and ready to quit  But I can't quit because money  so then the options are either spend most of your free time applying for a different job  or check out of the system altogether   Now I don't even want to apply to any places  because the definition of insanity is doing the same thing and expecting a different result  Why would one job be any better than the last  Why go through all that tedious bullshit of making a resume  sending out cover letters  making phone calls  bullshitting through interviews  etc for months  if after the job starts it's going to be right back to thoughts of suicide   I see nothing I could do that would satisfy me  Nothing realistic anyway   it's of course childish to want to be a musician or whatever in the modern day  which is the only thing that might actually be workable  And given that I'm not religious and therefore am not superstitious about death  I am fully willing to kill myself  At this point I'm just waiting for the right time 
Please share the company 
Go to the police right away  Be strong

1  It doesn't have to be an entire year   If you don't think it's fixable then it may be best to move on   2  Try and reach out to people   Old friends  family  or just find something silly to do   As hard as it may be  find a way to find people to be with   Being alone makes life extremely difficult   We aren't meant to be all alone   3  Someone needs you in their life  even if you don't think so   Someone does or will need you   Decide between 1 2 
I stay the fuck away from it  Can't get out of my head when I'm high 
Maaan  I didn't lose my virginity til like 21  I don't think it's anything to be ashamed of   And generally  I feel you  I'd like to have people in my life for every reason you listed too 
Hopefully it works out   Brush it off if it doesn't   Best of luck man 
Wow  That's a big dose when considering the Wellbutrin and Adderall dosage together 
I'm very glad to hear that you wouldn't ever go through with suicide   I've never been a good student either  I was very luck to find someone willing to give me my break  I'm sure that person is out there for you too   I'll be your friend if you want 
Hello my lonely friend  it sounds like you just need to go to a bar on a Friday or Saturday night and ask random girls if they would like to go on a date with you some time in the future    Make sure to tell them what you like about them  your hobbies  your job and more about yourself  Prepare to get rejected a lot by girls who are married and who have boyfriends  lesbians and girls who just like guys who aren't like you    Regardless of that fact  make sure you don't take rejection personally and keep moving down the line after being denied    Good luck and happy hunting  my soon to not be lonely friend    
You got this  
If you're into podcasts  I recommend listening to "Shrink for the Shy Guy" from the beginning  even if you think SA and "just shy" are miles apart 
Why you hate us 
I am so sorry for your loss  and I feel your pain  I'm having a hard time finding the right words  but for now  I'd like to say this   The initial shock and pain will wear off over the next few days  It will be replaced by a dull ache in your chest  Occasionally it will return  but every time it does  it will be slightly more bearable  and slightly less painful  It will never quite go away though  Which  in my opinion is good  You don't really want it to   I reckon everything feels a little surreal right now  If so  it's because you haven't really registered what's happened completely  and probably won't for a little while yet    Once the dust has settled  when all the condolences and shows of support are finished rolling in  some time in maybe a few days  weeks or months  When the world has moved on  That's when you will be hit with the true realisation of what's happened and it will hit you hard    I urge you  please  Don't stand in it alone  Your family loves you  and they are in the same place as you  They will need you  as much as you will need them  Cry openly  Talk to each other  Scream at the world if you need it    Remember  There is no limit to mourning  You will never stop  And it's okay not to    I hope you all the best  Good luck  I'll be thinking of you and your family in the year to come    
Man  Well  I'm a woman and I know you're not trash  for what it's worth  Rejection hurts   I was turned down a couple months ago  too 
I don't want to reiterate my story although you can find a summary a ways back in my comments  however I will say that it's is infuriating that my severe PTSD is undermined because I didn't sign myself up for a war  Infuriating doesn't touch it actually  I didn't have a choice in this matter  I didn't sign a dotted line saying I understand the possibility of my life being taken from me in my own home    That being said  PTSD is PTSD  Having a legitimate diagnosis  I wouldn't wish it upon anyone and I can understand the severity of some veterans' PTSD  Just as I can sympathize with you more than maybe PTSD from a car accident  PTSD is lonely and the more access we have to remind us we are not alone and others can understand  the better for all of our healing

I just checked your profile and saw that you play overwatch  how is your PC good enough for that if you live in south east Europe  I had to refund the game because my PC wasn't good enough which sucks  it felt like being poor on Christmas back when there was a ton of hype about the game and I couldn't play it  I would most likely uninstall league of legends If i could play overwatch

About 8 or 9 years ago I started an SSRI  and experienced something similar after a week and a half of taking it  I have only a very vague memory of the experience but according to family I had showed up to my mom's work  hospital  barefoot   in my sleep clothes  I was rambling that I couldn't stop "falling down through the basement of the church" into hell and I needed help  The only real memory I have of those couple days is doing a lot of drawing writing and thought it was automatic writing from a ghost or demon trying to send a message through me  Even the movement of my body felt outside of me  like someone else was moving me as a doll or something       That was almost 10 years ago and I still have the same diagnosis and it's never happened again to that extent at least  since I stopped the SSRI after that incident        u outofshell may be onto something bc I'm bipolar w  dysphoric mania  But I've honestly never had a manic episode that felt like that  even my more paranoid anxious ones don't even come close  
Damn  I only got A's and B's my first two years in college  I wish I was really smart  I just kept telling myself that engineering is hard  My peers didn't think so hahah   So anyways  instead of wanting to crawl into a hole and die  you should want to go outside and explore the world and all the cool shit in it    I bet you can find the confidence to ask the girl you have a crush on if you expect her to reject you  Just come to terms with it and anticipate it    You can just be like  "hey  I really like this about you  and I'd like to go on a date with you  just text me later or not at all whenever you made up your mind "  So what's on your bucket list  
That was a rape  tell your parents now

True   
I always get the sense of doom right before a panic attack  I think this is our brain and body going "wait  something's different  RED ALERT EVERYONE " I always think the feeling of doom is that split second when my  for example  average joe plumber cells put their tools down and reach for the weapons  All hands on deck type situation  It's brief  but to those of us with anxiety and health anxiety  feels terrifying    I find the only helpful thing is breathing and riding it out  and that usually helps to stop the ensuing panic attack as well  But sometimes it doesn't then you just gotta ride that out as well  
Not a snowballs chance in hell  Had it for too long 
Dude that's not funny  
You're very welcome 
I highly recommend you read the book "Why Am I Still Depressed " by Dr  Jim Phelps  My psychiatrist recommended it to me  with the warning that some of the information is a little outdated   It goes over a lot of these issues  such as what very mild cases of hypomania can look like  Many people think they're just having a rare good day  What's significant is that you're having breaks in the depression yet continue to relapse  In contrast  someone with just depression would have one or two major episodes throughout their life  during which they would not experience relief  However  once the depression is over  it's over  Bipolar depression comes and goes   The book also discusses the idea that bipolar disorder and unipolar depression are on a spectrum  and it's possible to not "really" be bipolar but be just bipolar enough that you'd do better on mood stabilizers than antidepressants  Not all mood stabilizers are scary  especially the ones for milder cases  I personally am on Tegretol and Lamictal  and haven't had many side effects other than a little bit of forgetfulness  Nothing more significant than forgetting a word in the middle of a conversation  In contrast  before I took these meds I was suicidal  Definitely worth it   When I was on antidepressants  lexapro  to be specific   I did find them to help enormously in terms of making that awful  empty feeling go away and preventing me from becoming suicidal  However  I did continue to experience mild depression and changes in attitude   for example  being talkative and productive one day  and antisocial and exhausted the next   I highly recommend you read this book and request an evaluation  Good luck with everything 
Nah you're better without her mate  You'll find better people to fill your time with dont worry  Do things you normally wouldn't go to conventions  study your school work at coffee shops  just go outside more and you're sure to meet some crazy person that fits your personality 
This is how I feel about every hobby or skill I've tried my hand at so far in life  including drawing 
You did everything right in your apology  She's being somewhat passive aggressive to you with her short responses  and I wonder why  It seems like a really easy thing to forgive since you were so thorough and sincere  I feel there must be more to it for her to be mad at you in this way  But  considering she has responded to you at all and that she hasn't blown up at you  I feel like your friendship can get passed this  Give her a little time and check to see how she is doing in a few days  Good luck  
Never really thought of it that way before  That would be really great  I'd totally be willing to try that instead of wanting to die  Like a computer that just has too much junk on it  viruses and malware  the brain just gets too cluttered  Bad memories and experiences that don't go away  It would be wonderful to start over    During the holidays I actually bought a new hard drive for my computer and when it arrived I decided rather than just adding it to the total storage of my system  I disconnected the two old ones and put them away and started fresh with this one  Those old drives had files and folders and thousands of pictures from the last decade  Any time I wanted to find something it took forever to navigate  It has been so refreshing to use my PC now that there's hardly anything on it  I'm careful about what I add to it  I try not to just save random funny pictures and stuff that would clutter everything up all over again  The old hard drives are still available if I ever need to plug them in and find something  but that doesn't seem likely   That would be great to get a chance to do that with my brain  Forget about all the pain and disappointment I've experienced  Start over fresh and make an effort to not let things get so cluttered again  Sometimes it's too difficult to untangle something and sort it all out  you just need a clean slate

Man  You and me  we're experiencing such similar situations  Two or three months ago I ceased pretty much all contact from my family because they are toxic and manipulative   Doing that has been so hard  because I didn't just abandon the people  but also the hope of having a loving and supportive family that I so desperately need right now  If you would like someone to talk to about this  I'm all ears  I would really like to 
Couldn't you just hide that you don't belive in god  
 I love cinematography  Studied a bit about it  It's funny if one can just sit there and watch a movie without thinking too much about it  Or analyzing the colors being used  the composition  the number of cuts and so on   Yes  I think connection is something very personal  Sometimes I go completely contrary to public opinion on a piece  umph I hope that doesn't sound hipster      It's nothing to be ashamed of  either   Frankly I don't know about that yet    Are those the extremophiles  badass organisms that prefer what we as humans would consider 'extreme conditions'    Interesting enough they are not     They are not considered extremophilic because they are not adapted to exploit these conditions  This means that their chances of dying increase the longer they are exposed to the extreme environments  6  whereas true extremophiles thrive in a physically or geochemically extreme environment that would harm most other organisms  3  13  14    If you think about it  things could have gone the other way  if people had decided that gender roles would be opposite of what they are now  at a time when they were still being very actively incorporated into society  if that makes sense   things could have been very different   Yes  this whole fear of males about homosexuality isn't actually that old     These concepts are so malleable  and often  people use a greater power than themselves to justify it  Sometimes people would rather use faith than reason or science to make their decisions    Or 'nature'  There are also gay animals but who really cares  You can't convince those people    The only thing I can think of as being similar is 'real women have curves'   Okay  that's a valid example  It's true what you're saying    But we've set men to certain standards that shouldn't even define the whole of the person  i e   you have to have a well paying job and be the sole provider of the family's income   which isn't even very possible these days  and a lot of families have both parents working part or full time   that's probably why the idea is very slowly shifting  I hope    Strangely enough I never understand this "male me has to be the sole provider for the family" or "if my partner earns more than me my selfworth is seriously damaged"  I don't know why but that doesn't scratch me at all 
I got prescribed Wellbutrin and it put me in a great place for 3 days  Then shit got way worse than before and I had to finally quit taking it    I have a very similar situation to you  Please share     And congrats 
Hey  I read a little bit of your post history  and I want to let you know that you seem very sweet and I'm glad you're still with us  I'm sorry life has been so rough for you that you have considered ending it  I can totally understand wanting to do something like that when you're in hell  You must feel very powerless and alone to be living with the family you have described  who call you a burden and other things no one should ever have to hear  You deserve better  Please know that I'm always here to talk about absolutely anything  You have mentioned wanting to move to Germany    sprichßt du Deutsch    
I totally feel you here  really early morning right now but I keep procrastinating going to bed because I'm to anxious  Wish I had some words of advice other than try to get to bed a lot earlier
I think you should give her a little more time to process things  I mean  was she also upset about something else  If I were in her situation I would believe and forgive you based on what I know  So  I feel something else must be weighing on her mind   You apologized that she had to drive home  How come 
Go for it  Ive begun my process as well and it feels amazing to finally work towards being alive and well 
Time to get help 
Yes  the  cholinergic hypothesis of depression  https   scholar google com scholar hl en q cholinergic hypothesis of depression btnG  as sdt 1 2C30 as sdtp   was the subject of several papers in the 70s and 80s   Here are some more recent papers that are interesting   https   www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles PMC3587265    An AchEI increased anxious and depressive behavior in rodents  reversed both by an SSRI and by anticholinergics   http   www sciencedirect com science article pii S1471489207001968   this posits that accumbens dopamine acetylcholine balance could be important in withdrawal related anxiety from amphetamines and opioids 
Leap2 has the best advice anyone could give on the matter  Until the source of these attacks is rooted and a particular path of treatment is referred to  the best we can do is pull some guesses  In the mean time  there are several things you can try that wouldn't hurt at all  such as writing down whatever comes to mind during your attacks  maybe you'll find a pattern   brewing your preferred hot drink to settle down with  taking hot showers  rolling yourself in your covers to give yourself a sense of security  and so forth

Thank you for sharing this  My girlfriend is helping me with my anxiety and depression issues but she hadn't had much experience with either until we got together  We are working on a plan together for it and this will help a lot 
Not everyone can be bothered to read long ass text messages  There's a reason people add 'TL DR' to Reddit posts   Sorry I'm not having a go at you intentionally it's just long boring texts that blab on really bother me personally and turn me off    From my experience I would suggest a few short sentences at most which quickly gives the message what's going on or how you're felling so the recipient gets the message quickly and easily then at the end add "can we get together to talk when you are free "  for example  
I went on the mire a because my bipolar meds made my birth control ineffective  Anyhow  I lik it  My period has actually disappeared  I don't get one anymore  I haven't noticed any affect on my mood or anything    Just a tip though  see if you can get a ride home from the doctor  The cramps are bad after inserting  Also  pop some Tylenol or something an hour or so before the procedure   
Annoying my friends with my constant negativity  it's hard for me to contribute any other way at this point  Everything feels like a waste  as if it was already decided for me to suck at everything I try to devote myself towards  I am absolutely hopeless for my future  this will probably be the happiest time of my life and I'm hating every second of it

Oh  I should also mention  Speaking as a woman who has spoken passive aggressively to someone  as your friend did to you  she is likely trying to hurt you a little bit  But  a sort of hurt that she still likes you in some way  It's just a weird  awful  thing girls do to mess with your head    The last time I did that I felt like I wanted to push that person away to hurt them  but also to hurt myself

Holy crap  yes  I'm back to throwing up and screaming while either getting ready in the morning or in the bathroom before my shift  
Oh man  I know how you feel  Back when I still cared and had the energy  I would practice my trumpet and maybe play a few simple exercises reasonably ok  Then I'd see something like  this  https   youtu be RLDF8OeD hc t 304  and just think "oh    right    I can't play the trumpet  Nevermind "    On another note though  that's one  hell  of a cadenza     There's a reason Maurice Andre was so highly regarded  Every single note he plays is stunning    Also the same thing applies with drawing  I have so many ideas for things I need to draw but I've been graced with the almost complete inability to take something from my head and put it onto paper  
you can get things called suspension trainers that you can hang over the back of a door or over a beam etc  The original brand for them is called TRX and they go for about 170GBP or you can do like I did and get a cheap knockoff from ebay for about 20GBP    As things like bodyweight training are becoming more popular things like rings etc are easier to get hold of too 
It gives me an appetite  I swear I'd go days without eating more than a few crackers if I didn't use a little at meal times  
For me  anytime I get triggered  I have multiple traumas  because apparently I'm an overachiever  I'd say it's a tightness in me  an urgency and hyper awareness that something is off  sonething is wrong   I begin to not trust anything and my paranoia gets a lot worse  heightened mostly to the area that is triggering me but also to other things   Fr my sexual trauma I start to question everything in my mind and things speed up  this happens in general  with other triggers too  but I begin to feel not in the moment but feel out of control and begin to panic   I have had panic attacks during sex  to which my husband immediately stops and asks me what I need   Does any of tfat sound familiar

We forgive you  All of us  It's not your fault that society aestheticizes mental illnesses and sweeps their devastating reality beneath the carpet  It truly is something one needs to experience before understanding 
I feel you there  I think I may need to get back into therapy at some point but I really don't want to  Facing the things that give me anxiety is very hard for me  and sometimes  even with therapy  I can't figure out what they are   Hang in there  if you have a good therapist it should help     
Thank you for the reassurance  It means a lot  Hopefully this will past shortly  so I can get on with life  until the next issue comes along  lets be honest   You're probably right  if it was something serious i would know for sure  I really just hate the anxiety that comes with symptoms or what i think are symptoms  most of the time the symptoms probably aren't that bad but the anxiety is what really knocks you down  Good luck with your ulcers  I hope you feel better soon  
Wishing you the best   
Last night I watched The Amazing Spiderman 2 out of sheer boredom  The ending conveyed perhaps one of the most clichéd motivational messages in the world  "keep fighting "   but goddamit if it didn't strike a chord deep within me

There are     If you really want to go thetherapy route  finding the right therapist is tantamount   It's not abut their education  either  it's about how you feel   My therapist was actually originally my husband's  I went in totalk about his stuff  then we started couple's counselibg and then I saw him for my stuff because I built a trust   I had been seeing another therapist and it just wasn't working     A lot of therapists have bios online  or talk about their views or treatment methods   I would check around that way   My husband foubd our therapist that way and immediately clicked with him first session  in a way he'd never done with any other therapist   I'd done the same with a therapist back East      hug  good luck
Various reasons   I have always felt more "European" than in my current home country  Germany is in the center of Europe and since I either plan to move a lot or visit other European countries  it's best choice for me  Also I like German culture  language and people  And yes  I've been to Germany once  Lübeck   Well  the things that work take time and pain  Pain   pain is never going to feel good

This is so me  Even when I was younger  like age 5 or 6  and my aunt would call from another country  I couldn't talk to her   Recently  I needed help making a phone call for my friend  I asked if he could call for me instead  He didn't understand why  I told him I can't make phone calls and he still didn't get it

Does anyone else keep confusing this sub and r introvert with r me irl
I want to get this out somewhere because I don't know who to talk to in real life  but it's been a rough week for me  Luckily I'm on break from school but I've had a tough time sleeping because I found out this week that my sister has Hep C  I feel like it is something that I cannot talk about to people or that she doesn't want them to know  She has been an IV drug user and has abused alcohol in the past  and she is trying to get clean so she can get treatment  I am a nursing student and I know how bad liver problems can be and I just sit up at night with anxiety that she is going to get very sick and die or that she is going to give up and go back to drugs and die  I think about her  about myself and about my parents and it just makes me physically sick to my stomach  I don't know what to do because unlike some other triggers for anxiety  I feel like the threat is very real and it's harder to talk myself down from it  Thanks to anyone who reads this    I hope all will turn out okay 
I'm able to get an erection  but I've been so full of anxiety  the kind you can feel and it makes your body tense  that it's overwhelming and I haven't felt any sex drive since  I also am not waking up with morning wood  I just wish this whole incident had never happened 
I smoke a lot  I pay careful attention to my strains though and why I'm smoking  it's just like any other drug prescription whatever   like coffee  Would you drink espresso before bed  Doing something like that could make you think coffee was horrible  why does anyone drink the stuff   Oh wait  you're doing it wrong  
The sad thing is    I do less than he does  
Yes  me too  I have been taking baths and that does help me a little  but I'd love to see other peoples ideas  Hang in there 
Sorry to you and your family for your loss  Cant imagine how muc pain it would feel  Hope you can in good time continue to make the progress you recently had  in good time 
Well  I really had a rather bad time  I ended up sweating like a pig in my dress  there were like 10 guys with us and all they talked about was army  girlfriends  their old classmates  and I felt bad and out of place  Even my bf forgot my existence at times and he was too absorbed talking with his pals  The worst thing was having to listen to "manly" dirty jokes that sometimes were borderline offensive to women and I was forcing stupid smiles  After we went home my bf finally understood  I hope this time it stays in his head 
What are the things you think you need to do  If what you are trying is painful  maybe it doesn't actually work  and you could try something else  One difficult part about healing from trauma and depression is that we may bury painful feelings because they are too much at the time they arrive  We become numb to protect ourselves  When we later feel a little safer and open to our emotions  we find all this hurt there and it may seem shocking  like we're still stuck or getting worse  But you might find that if you allow yourself to feel whatever you need to feel  try not to feel shame because you have bad feelings  and treat your wounds like a child that needs soothing    this process may get easier  Does any of that help  even a little bit   I love the German culture too  I lived in Germany for five years when I was very young  and here in Canada I was a teacher at a German language school for several years  The language is so melodious to me  and I'm amused when others say they find it harsh  I think they've just seen too many Nazi movies    
Good on you for making the decision  Best of luck
I feel the same way  I'm 20  Even though I've had some action with girls kissing  making out etc   I'm still a virgin and never had an actual relationship  I have a couple of friends  they have girlfriends and seeing them happy together makes me feel like I'm missing out and that I've failed in life 
Drawing is one of the hardest hobbies to feel satisfied with because it takes years to actually get good at and progress can feel slow which leads to frustration  I like drawing but it can be so stressful 
I somewhat want to believe this    but it also feels like we are doing survivorship bias here  Overly concentrating on those few who made it without seeing those who struggled and didn't contribute for anything    Sorry  I didn't want to damage your idea  I still think it's a good thought  But I can't fully embrace it  
I will try my hardest to become successful and overcome my disadvantages  I think that my pain is a part of my motivation

I think of it as righteous vengeance  Well  to an onlooker it might seem silly but it really gives me the jollies   If they want to attack me  they should be prepared for the consequences   Edit  How is this harmful 
That's AWESOME  
I'm felling the same way  No friends   always alone  and playing video games  But the two of us can make it  just do what makes you happy and try to apply yourself to something at least  I know what I'm saying doesn't feel like words of encouragement  but maybe the bad things will come away and good will overflow  With just a couple of steps  I hope you feel better and get through this 
I don't or ever smoked regularly  Last time I got paranoid and I could only wait for it to pass  Terrible experience  never again 
I don't know  Maybe we're just different  But this seems a tad sadistic to me   Actually  I shouldn't be telling you what you can or cannot do  That's not my place  I just don't relish the idea of killing insects for the hell of it 
I realized recently just how much of my music is either sad or negative or serious or dark or gloomy in some way  I used to have a lot more upbeat music but I guess somewhere along the way it started to become hard to listen to it  feeling bad then hearing the line     "I'm stupidly happy      Everything's fine      I'm stupidly happy      My heart pumping wine      I'm stupidly happy      With idiot grin      I'm stupidly happy      it's surely a sin "   just feels awful  And something about songs that are so obviously major key happy doesn't work either  I've been unintentionally gravitating strongly to slower  darker songs  Something about hearing     "The sides are steep the waters deep      From bank to brae the water's pouring      And your bonnie grey mare she sweats for fear      She stands to hear the water roaring       And woe betide you Annan Water      At nights you are a gloomy river       And over you I'll build a bridge      That never more true love may sever "   where you can  feel  the mournful  aching sadness of the words just clicks with me and feels 'right' when I listen to it  where the happy songs cause some kind of dissonance or discomfort  
I have GAD as well  A great hobby that helps me relieve anxiety is walking  just getting out the house and walking around the neighborhood  Running tends to make me scared and I worry about what other people think when they look at me  so I walk now  I definitely recommend that      As for crazy day to day situations  the best thing that helps me are breaks  If I'm feeling overwhelmed or stressed out  I leave to the bathroom to calm down and tell myself that my fears are irrational  and it's just the anxiety talking  I go there around 4 times a day to do this  Sometimes a feel lazy and unproductive because I need so many breaks  but it's important to remember that your personal sanity comes first

Sounds like more of an issue on their end to me  Wouldnt she be hurt by losing you too

You were raped  It's not an easy battle to fight  But you should report it  To be completely honest  the government and society will make it hard to win this case   but you can become much STRONGER taking the fight to them  And maybe they'll think twice if they try it to someone else 
Everyone has flaws  Learning who we are is harder than anything  It takes time  and mistakes    but in the end we need to understand that we all have strengths too     Were all weird in your own way  If it helps  I'm usually the one making weird jokes that not everyone laughs at  P but those who do are    special   Want to talk  Pm me or reply here  I'd love to listen

I admit I'm somewhat a sadist   And no I don't hold it against you for trying to dissuade me  instead I'm glad you did  gives me a little drop of hope for humanity   I wouldn't say I kill them for fun  I kill torture them because they have the intention to hurt me  This might come as a surprise to you but I love insects in general  spiders too  reptiles    Fishes    Not so much for mammals  I wouldn't dream of hurting any of those mentioned above  but if they strike to kill  I should repay in kind 
I tend to gravitate towards music thats  dark  angry  depressing  and or chaotic  That music resonates with me  and happy music makes me immeasurably sad and uncomfortable
I kissed my first girl at 19  She was 32 I think  We met on the Craigslist personals section  I think it was good to just get it out of the way  Next time you think a girl likes you  and it's a non school or professional setting  just ask her if she wants to kiss and then if she actually does like you  bam that's crossed off the list  And if she doesn't  just say  "Ok just thought I'd ask " 
I hope somewhere deep inside you realize that these things don't have shit for brains  Do you really think they are out to try and hurt you  These little pests are living their lives  they don't even know what it means to be inflicting pain on others  This probably wont make you change your ways  cause depression turns people into hopeless  stubborn fucks  and trust me  I know  But hopefully you'll maybe learn to empathize a bit for these pesks  You're getting revenge on them for something they don't even realize they do  Take your anger out on something else  whatever it may be  just not something living  no matter how much you hate them  Hope you read this  
 College will be better  trust me  High school is a terrible place  and everyone knows it  The people bullying you have their own personal issues and are incredibly immature  those types of people grow up to be complete losers after high school  But you have to bite the bullet until graduation  then learn from your past to become a strong  successful person  Most adults here will agree with me in saying that your life pretty much starts after high school    few people care about high school  enjoyed it  or define themselves by their high school experience  I'm a senior in high school as well  we can do this

It's crazy how similar our stories are   I have mild OCD  anxiety  and depression  My OCD is much better on venlafaxine but my depression is still there  Let me know if you end up changing meds  I am desperately wanting to change up what I'm taking since I feel so out of it and just dull 
I have the same condition but I faint randomly  Roughly 5 10 times it happens to me  I feel you  We can maybe talk here  or pm's 
Do you feel like your depression is completely gone  How much venlafaxine are you taking 
yes it happens to me less though it has so far only happened 3 times in my life i'm 11 by the way  in 6th grade now   
I read all my comments   I understand that they have no concept of malice despite acting out like a bunch of tiny barbarians  doesn't change the fact that they are inflicting pain on me  Don't get me wrong  I don't mind the black ones biting me since they barely hurt at all  but the red ones can cause me to yell and wince when they bite   As for living things  I try to have empathy for them as long as they are friendly with me  I've had pets and I treat them like my babies  I wouldn't dream of hurting them  even if they bite me  But red ants you see  they swarm  they are territorial and they are in my way  I can't safely relocate them without them crawling up my hands and giving me a world of pain    But  I'd also say this  I don't value the life of any creature  perhaps only mine and my family for practical reasons  This is silly to say but those ants can either be my friends  be neutral  or suffer consequences 
I feel like more people need to be open to talking about their negative traits  As a person with depression  I've had trouble in the past talking about things I hate about myself and if someone brings them up I'd just ask them not to talk about it  This led to a lifestyle where I was able to understand why I was unhappy  but unable to do anything about it as I didn't know how to change it or who to talk to  to change it   I'll give a personal anecdote for this  I've always been pretty awkward  I never really knew why  I just though that was how I was supposed to be and there was nothing I could do about it  The more I talked about how awkward I was  the less awkward I became  It shed new light on things I hadn't even considered before  it led to me understanding the root of my awkwardness and how to effectively combat it  It turned from me hating my awkwardness  to me embracing that I was awkward sometimes  but I could improve my social skills and become more outgoing   Introspection can only get you so far in the end  You really need to talk to someone to truly understand how you feel  as an outside opinion can often by the tipping point in the end to understanding yourself  It's a constant battle between having to want to get better and the depression  however when you start to improve your life in any way it can lead to you wanting to get help and not being content with just being nothing   I suppose first you need to understand what makes you unhappy about yourself and actively want to change that  You can't just want other people to fix your life  it won't happen  but they can really help you keep on track with self improvement  You have to do a lot of soul searching and introspective thought before you can even begin to understand yourself and I don't think I truly understand myself to this day  but I still know a lot more than I used to and I'm happy about that   This is a bit of a ramble  but I wanted to share because you seem like a nice  good person  We're all a little fucked up  but being able to confront our demons is how we better ourselves and you can only take on so many demons by yourself  Congratulations on staying sober for three months  It's a true accomplishment  even if there was a relapse  You seem like you can conquer if  if need be and if you need any help feel free to talk to me  Have a good day 
I like to pretend my future self has life figured out  I live out fantasies about how successful I am and how well I handle situations  I have dreams like this as well

Do you go to any therapist  I'm curious as to how this has manifested elsewhere in your life  
You really could have helped somebody in trouble  You did good   D
I remember the dark days when I couldn't even do a single one  and now I can do 100  in a single sitting and 300  over the course of a day   
I need to go through a period of psychologist and psychiatrists to get medication for this 
Well I promised her that we would have a place to stay so she wouldn't have to drive home drunk or close to drunk 
That sounds like a very unpleasant experience  You did the right thing by calling for help  although it's understandable if you felt too numb or scared to do so  I wish you and those neighbours  including the couple  all the best in healing 
I can say I'm afraid of falling asleep but not because sleep is scary but because I won't be awake and able to focus on things  I crave control over all of the happenings in my life so sleep takes that away from me  I think it may actually be more apnea related became from what I understand  when asleep  your brain is in a different state and is rarely able to acknowledge that is it even asleep

Yes I do visit a therapist for depression and anxiety  I was also described as having difficulty working with others    Which I'd say I've outgrown the latter   What do you mean by 'how this has manifested elsewhere' 
This makes me really happy  I don't know you at all but this makes me proud   Good luck  man   I hope it works out    
I empathize with this  but what I will say is that these ants won't be friends with anyone  That doesn't give us a reason to break their limbs off one by one just for show  The mere concept of wanting to savagely massacre such insignificant beings kind of manifests a lack of human emotion  I'm not one to be telling people about having emotions  but if I were to become my ideal depression less self  it would be someone who knows how to control his barbaric side  especially on such trivial ants      That said  I know it's tough and I empathize because I assume you deal with these ants on a regular basis and I can imagine how irritating they could get  Take what I said above with a grain of salt  but maybe you could try and deal with them in less morbid ways  And I know it's really hard  especially with depression  so I'll leave it at this   
Remember  no matter how bad things May seem now  they are likely not that bad  With anxiety we tend to focus on the negatives because we are afraid of them and try to avoid them  But focus on what is going on in your immediate life  What is happening right in front of you and work on thinking about that and forming your feelings around that  Trump becoming elected May lead to some crazy things happening or it may NOT  we don't know  but he is president and we will find out so sorry about the bad when it presents itself to you in your immediate life 
Yeah bump to this one  This is something I am trying to overcome as well so you aren't alone  I know its a trust issue and believe it stemmed from past friendships relationships where I was lied to by two races people  I try to remember there are good people who truly want to be my friend out there  Still a struggle 
If you're willing to do an experiment try this  next time the teacher tells the class to form groups and you see that your classmates are starting to approach each other don't just stand there  approach them too  Don't say anything  don't ask if you can be in their group  just walk to their side and stand there  This may be helpfull for 2 reasons  first if the other classmates see the group is already full they may not approach it and you get to stay there  second because you'll get to see what is the reaction of the other group members to your approach  Also try to do this with groups of people you've already been a part of in previous classes  they may be more accepting that way    This may not work  but I guess it's worth trying  Just don't injure yourself on purpose  in some years you will look back and realize how not worthy that was  You can even end in a weelchair  or a bed  for the rest of your life because of that kind of things

Thank you  this is the kind of thing I was looking for  
If that's what you want to do  then that might help you  Do you think that you will only feel better once you get medication  You've mentioned elsewhere that you find going to the psychologist psychiatrist a waste of time  why is that  What sort of support do you think would help you  and not be a waste of time 
Most likely  it's a side effect  I used to take in the evening but had to stop due to muscle weakness and light headiness in the morning  I take it now at 19h max in order to not have morning sickness and muscle weakness 
I am proud of you  That is a huge step  I hope the rest of your year goes well too   D
Good job going to see someone  that's really an admirable thing to do that I know I've even struggled with  You are never alone  there is always someone for you to talk to  whether someone on here or someone in person  Keep on pushing through 
There's a match out there but he has similar problems  My more successful relatonships have been with girls who have anxiety as well 
Your wife not telling you doesn't mean she doesn't trust you  Rape is a very private and isolating incident for most people  it takes a lot all it courage to tell someone  like the above comment once people know someone is a rape victim that becomes their label  Maybe she has repressed the incident and put it to the back of her mind   Fact is that you won't know until she tells you  however I wouldn't recommend just out right asking her  Maybe bring it up in general conversation  it's not a topic which is usually spoken about a lot but maybe if you have read or seen someone on TV  Wait until she tells you  she may not be ready to deal with this and asking her outright about it may inadvertently cause her distress    I can imagine how upsetting it might be for you  you seem to have a very supportive and positive relationship  and you are already being supportive by asking for advice  don't think of it as something you are doing wrong  some survivors don't tell anyone  
I am so sorry for your loss  My thoughts and prayers for your family 
Perhaps you're right  I do what I do because I want to instill fear and establish dominance over them  but those little critters probably won't understand my intentions  That's not to say I didn't take joy in getting my revenge   Less morbid huh  Maybe a quick splat  or smack them half dead 
That's kinda the thing though  I don't know what I want out of life  You can tell me to get out there and search for it  but it just doesn't work like that for me  Lots of people here are depressed cause they broke up  they lost a loved one  hate their job  etc  But I'm one of the people that literally don't understand their existence  I don't know why I'm even here  Gaming just makes life go by faster and there's no real passion or interest in reach  Even if I go to community college  what do I study  How will I even have the mental state to survive through more schooling  It's all just a blur to me  my future and my past  My present is just me wasting my life away  
I don't live in America bro You are years ahead of Poland   
Oh man  dude so heartbreaking  man I wish I could do something for you but I can't  I wish I was religious so I I could at least say a prayer for you but I can't even do that    dude this is not in any way your fault  this is life it's how life works  it's a fucking cunt  and that's just what it is    Please know that    from one internet stranger to another  much love mate  Kia Kaha  be strong 
Depersonalization Derealization is a symptom you can get from anxiety  often it comes out when under greater stress anxiety episodes  Personally i think it's horrible  and i have a very hard time accepting it    Dpdr is a kind of protection  protecting you from too much external stuff 
this post is everything  thank YOU LOOOLING
I just try to act strong and confident even though i'm screaming on the inside  It kinda changes the other persons actions towards me  Sometimes   
That's perfectly fine  I went through high school being relatively shut out and I'm in college now pretty much the same  I'm trucking on through and have a few people im familiar with now  
Get proper medical health  Panic and anxiety attacks are easily solved with the right medication  That is one of those incredibly excruciating pains and suffering than can be actually very easily avoided just with a few meds for some time  But that kind of medication must be prescribed and controlled by a proper doctor  This is very important  Once that issue is solved you also should start looking until you find a therapist that suits yourself and can help you with the depression 
Hey  I definitely understand your take on the situation however i've thought about this even without my stress head on and I believe that this is the right decision for me  Also this is british college so it's kind of different  I wouldn't get a degree from this I'd get a BTEC  Also it's in a subject that is not really of any help to me in the search for jobs  I also definitely understand that looking for a job isn't going to be easy and neither is actually working however I feel that I'd actually be earning something from this as opposed to what i'm doing at the moment in college  Thank you for your input though 
Or smack them full dead  so they don't have to endure it  Do what you gotta do to get your job done  If you gotta kill em  kill em  Just don't let the barbaric side take control of yourself  That's my invitation to you  
At the moment I think i'll just be looking for retail jobs to start out with   
Sorry to hear about the stomach bug  Today was chest and shoulders for me  and it was a hell of a workout  I'm really pleased with my progress on the bench so far 
It is quite astonishing really how much everyone who is depressed has in common with the symptoms of the illnesses  and as has been said  it's good to know you are not alone  and you are not  It is also good to know people like you and I are trying to understand and will beat it or make it become a minor annoyance at the least    Good day to you too Sir  Take Care  
I've dealt with it for so long it's my day to day state of mind now  Sucks really bad when I get drunk and relaxed and realize how much clearer everything is  Seeking psychiatric help now so here's to hoping  I'll bring this up so thank you for the info 
Thanks    I definitely know it's going to be a challenge but it's one that I'm willing to step up to  I wish you luck in your situation 
Fuck  fuck I think you're actually me  It's like being an untethered buoy in the middle of a tornado  beaten within an inch of your life but just  not  able  to sink  I have no one to grab my hand either  Only therapists who I pay to pretend to care  Once you've considered suicide  it's hard to come back from that place  It's hard not slip back into that headspace  I self medicate to sleep my life away also  Hoping for something to lift the grief off my heart because it's too heavy for me to lift and it's crushing me   The only reason I haven't done it is because I have this stupid fucking thing inside me that I hate deeply that clings to hope  I wish I could just do it  But that part of me just won't stop saying  'soon'  Soon it will be bearable  Soon there will be relief  and hope  I'm looking up from where I'm laying  on my back at the bottom of this god awful hole I've fallen down  been falling down for 20 years and there's no logical reason for me to see light at the top  but a little piece of me is saying there's a pinprick of sun up there and I can't ignore it  I wish I could  It would be so much easier to quit  It's like that cartoon that says   depressed people are the most hopeful people of all  A depressed person is like an unarmed soldier behind enemy lines surrounded by people trying to kill him with a trillion weapons and the soldier is crying out  "I'm outnumbered  but I can survive if someone just handed me a stick  just a stick and I would fight through every one of these men with guns  I just need one sign that someone is rooting for me against these awful odds and I will be okay  I'll manage  It's just me against a million but I'll be ok if I just had something to fight with" That is some crazy fucking optimism  It sounds insane  But it's how we are living our lives  in our minds  I wish I could find that cartoon  it says it better than I did  I'm just rambling at this point  I don't know what my point is  You're not alone  I'm rooting for you  I'm in the same situation  except we are both on different battlefields but we're fighting together  There's lots of us out there  Many of us only have our fists to fight with  fists against machine guns but we're still alive  That's a vicious  perverted kind of victory  but it's something  We have touched the limits  we have felt rock bottom and made our beds there  If we can do that then we make the long and bloody crawl back up to sunlight  just out of spite and defiance and the knowledge that we've climbed out of hell with half our limbs chopped off and our hearts shattered and we didn't fucking die  That is something  That's a stick I can grip on to       Edit  this is the cartoon http   m imgur com wZeK2vL r a little different to how I remember it
Looking at the event from the bright side of things  your coworker cares about you  Even though you couldn't tell him why you cry  at least he cares to ask what happens  Many people would just walk away from the room awkwardly  Cheer up and please use this sub to vent any frustration you have

Isn't     Isn't today Tuesday  
I believe you are describing a migraine  based on what family members that get them have told me 
I've been raised too sheltered to even know what I may be interested in  I'm at a point in my life now that it literally seems like even if I do meditate and think deeply about what i may want to make a living out of  literally nothing would come to mind  I have no exposure to anything beyond my computer screen  and venturing out would be a nightmare  If I can barely squeeze through high school  how do I expect myself to live through life and develop a work ethic  I sound like a whiney pre pubescent kid  but that's what I am  An average kid has more exposure to the world than I do  I just feel hopeless  
Did it actually grow mold   I mean  that question aside  you can wipe it down with a bleach solution inside and out  take the strings off first   Don't soak the wood   Wood is naturally antimicrobial  which is why butcher block cutting boards are better than plastic   so you only imperatively need to introduce the bleach to the surfaces that the towel may have touched   The inside should be fine because it's likely an untreated surface   Still  you can spritz a little bleach cleaner in there  Now let the whole thing dry while lying face up on the floor   Then  if you have central heating  place the ukulele near  but not on top of or resting over  a heater vent   If you don't have central heating  use a small space heater  Place the ukulele there  resting upon a dry towel   Rest it on its back for a couple hours  then turn it over and rest it on it's back     The gentle heat and forced air of the heating is just enough to evaporate the moisture and dry the wood   Don't do it too quickly  or the wood might warp   After it's dried maybe overnight  or over the course of an afternoon  put the strings back on and tune it   Should be fine  
I daydream like JD from Scrubs
Well  it's 12 46 AM on a Wednesday in    Kiritimati  Just roll with it 
Thanks for the suggestion  I like that song  I feel calmer right now 
Well    my mom does get them when she's stressed  She told me they got so bad at one point that she went to get checked out  but nothing was wrong  To be honest  I feel like a bit of an idiot for asking about this  but I needed to 
I just stopped taking it  Would nor recommend and get bollocked every time ibgo back to the docs    At the moment I'm quite stable but I think that's to do with the lifestyle here rather than some big breakthrough I've made  Sunshine helps  
Above all else  enjoy yourself  Running is a wonderful habit  once you really get into it  I plan to resume it once I'm a little further ahead in weightlifting 
Are you being paranoid  Quite possibly    Just  paranoid   That's a silly thing to say   This is causing you stress and pain  and affecting your quality of life   Why would it's objective rationality be the main concern   Perhaps you can find a therapist with experience on the issue  and or a support group   If it helps  when I've gone to therapy the first thing they do is explain in detail the confidentiality policy and laws   We skimmed through it  but only because it was pretty standard and neither I nor the therapist wanted to spend time on it  In your case  I'm sure they'd be able to spend the first couple of sessions going through it in detail so you feel secure and comfortable   I also chose to not allow therapeutic communication by email  because they don't guarantee security of the email and servers   It wasn't a problem  the only things I get emails about are appointment schedules and receipts 
Yes  I really got into it this summer and have my first full marathon coming up in April  but grad school and moving countries really threw my mental health out the window and I stopped this fall so I'm hoping a conscious goal of at least 1 mile per day will help me get the shoes on even when I'm "not feeling it" because I really love it when I'm out there  just really good a psyching myself out

Ha  I didn't even notice that  Still on holiday until next week so still in that "wait    what day is it again "
You shouldn't feel like an idiot  Your brain hurts  and you want to know why  and what you can do about it  and how worried you should be   You're being the opposite of stupid  you're being rational 
I agree with myceli yum that it would be important to get checked out by a doctor just in case  But if that does not lead to an insight  I would try a number of experiments if I were you  Try different exercises to see if the nausea occurs no matter what you do  for example what if you just go swimming for a change  Or go for a jog  Or even a walk  Try a much shorter and easier workout and see if you still get nauseous  Try it with a different trainer and without a trainer to see if it is something about your interaction with the trainer that leads to anxiety  Try working out on your own without anyone present  Also try to take the trainer's advice an increase your caloric intake significantly  and see whether that helps  Try different things and keep track of any times when you are not nauseous and figure out what could account for it  Once you find a way to work out without nausea  then you can start from that and see how much you can modify it to be more like your preferred workout but still without nausea  That's how I would approach it anyway 
thanks for answering
At least you have something you want  this is a blessing  Because the illness could be so bad  you don't even want anything    I used to be in your shoes  All I can say is use that desire to drive other changes  Maybe starting with looking at things from the bright side  Try to make little progress towards success  and change your belief that what you do is bad  My prayer is with you 
around the same age as me 
Yes they do learner stickers or badges  they're different depending on where you're from  absolutely  I practised in between lessons with my dad in his car as much as I could   Definitely recommend lessons and practicing with family  Eventually the lessons will just sort of become a mandatory thing and you'll look forward to them  and at that point you know you're close to taking your test  Good luck with it all    
I did that for a while but then being uncomfortable i just learnt to accept it  This can lead to health issues so I strongly suggest you don't do this  
Acceptance is the first step of recovery  I am so glad you have reached this first step  Good luck to you and if you need to just vent it out  feel free to pm me 
Thank you  It's just  I know I should be healthy  but there's been all these weird feelings and pains lately  and i'm so scared and confused 
Everyone's got stuff wrong with them   My right side obliques are so much stronger than the left that my hips get pulled out of alignment and it messes up my left knee and ankle 
but do you think what I believe is true or just bullshit  
I think your concerns are unfounded  unless someone with the right skills is specifically trying to stalk you   And  don't take this the wrong way  buy you're probably way too ordinary for someone to bother   Most of us are 
Sorry to hear that man definitely sucks this year so far but you got your whole life ahead of you to look forward to  Its what any mom would want for his son  
thanks  that makes me feel a little better
Just over a year ago I split with my partner  she took my daughter and moved out  she let me stay in our home  that she owned  for a month while I looked for accommodation  I swear if she hadn't left me my dog I would have taken my life  I have to admit I didn't treat him how he deserved over that time  Sometimes he didn't eat  because I couldn't get out of bed  he didn't get all the walks he needed  because I was in bed crying  or on the couch crying  or on the floor crying    But god damn that good boy greeted me every day with a big face full of doggy saliva  and gave me unconditional love when it didn't come from anywhere else  He lives with my ex now  he's got a HUGE fenced in yard and all the toys in the world and my little girl to play with so I couldn't be happier for him  but Dougy  I want you to know I love you buddy  from the bottom of my heart   I wouldn't be here without you 
Mmhm  And a lot of what I'm feeling is from anxiety  I just get overwhelmed 
Also  I have no idea who you are   I honestly don't know if you're male or female   Don't even have a hunch 
Not very well  My pre work anxiety starts on Friday night and tags along for the rest of the weekend     It's not constant but every hour or so my mind starts racing  flooding me with thoughts about tasks I need to solve at work  And it's usually the same when I'm trying to go to sleep 
Which is fine  You don't need to be okay right now  You will be okay again later 
I am still continuing the Core de Force workouts which are martial arts themed DVD workouts I got for Christmas  Today is supposed to be one I have not done yet called Agility Power  And because it is Tuesday  I will also go to folk dancing in the evening which I am eagerly awaiting 
I resigned last week partly because my boss decided to record my time off to attend two medical appointments as 'lateness ' I mean a few hours  Despite medical certificates l couldn't switch shifts to attend a brain scan or see my psychiarist to get meds 
I would tell a psychiatrist  This sounds like a few other disorders 
I will  And getting some sleep might help me  because I haven't gotten any at all  So  thank you again    
Yeh this is great for someone who has no idea how to help someone through a panic attack  Even if you don't have a partner  this could help a friend or a family member  
I am so sorry this happened to you   It is not your fault  it is theirs  If u are in the US  I believe this would be considered statutory rape   If so  you may be able to prosecute  In any event  do get some help   Stay strong  
Yes and no  Who we are a collection of our memories  We start wiping stuff out and we begin to lose ourselves  Humans learn from mistakes  If we forget our mistakes then we might unwittingly repeat them  Forgetting negative events in our lives could help us move forward  but there is a price to be paid   Ever watch the movie "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" 
Aw thank you

I was hoping there would be a silver bullet for this but that doesn't look to be the case   You've all given me a lot to mull over  I'll get back to you all after work  Thank you so much   Nausea is a pretty typical symptom for me but I definitely feel nauseous before I feel confusion or I start shaking   Has anyone had success with systematic desensitization on something like this  It's really worked well to get me into the gym and able to be around other people  I just don't know if the trigger is an internal physical sensation but I think if I lie down as you suggested  myceli yum  instead of just exit the situation the symptoms would at least stop worsening even if it's not a circulation issue  It's just that the nausea is so bad and the anxiety is kind of meh that I tend to just get home asap   Thanks again  all

I'm so sorry  Please don't give up hope 
I was on it for 1 5 years and had no dreams  also lithium though   When l was coming off it l had dreams for a week 
2 years ago  Did that 2 years ago  I will never return to it  Good idea though    I would go crazy if I had FB

It's cool to see someone else recommend that book and I'm happy shrinks are out recommending it  I constantly talk about it here and in real life   I've been talking about it for a decade because for me it was my "yes " moment 
Good luck for you  I will also seek help this year  after years of battling with my inner voice  Thanks for sharing
Call the police  Give me updates to ensure that you did 
I wish you luck
I smoked most days for about 10 years  from college to my late 20s  Most times when I took a break I would move to hypomania after a few days  which at the time was a great motivation to take a break  Of course  this was before I was diagnosed   My last binge was a couple of months after I was prescribed Wellbutrin  and when I stopped I came the closest to a full manic episode that I ever had   In retrospect  the prescription alone had already put me in hypo territory   After that I had my diagnosis and prescription changed  and started regular appointments with a pdoc   Now  I smoke on the rare occasion  a couple of times a year  and it is not a problem  Looking back  it certainly helped me cope before I got any professional help  and it certainly held me back from accomplishing a lot that I could have  including getting help   I never had the option of choosing strains  so I cannot say what effect that may have had   I really miss smoking weed  but I can honestly say my life is better now without it

Fantastic to hear  I'm traveling through Europe at the moment  Day 9 out of 32  and my anxiety has been dreadful  This is so inspiring   
dude congrats   I started with very little pushups too  now I can reach 40   5 months later  Now I fell in love with calethenics  I'm addicted to pushups because there are many variations of push ups  keep going  
so fucking true
The same thing happened to me  I stressed after I read that post  Convinced myself next time I felt that feeling I'd be dead 
Here is how to progress if you cant do 1 push up   Warm up your wrists  important   and do negative push ups  If you dont know what that is  You put yourself in the push up position with arms straight and go down as slowly as possible    repeat until you can go down and then up afterwards 
Yourself    your past    reality  Maybe it's time to confront whatever it is and work with it and not against it 
This sounds like rape      If it were not rape you'd have described a feeling of honestly  wanting  to have sex with all of them  That is some people's kink  I'm sorry but as one woman to another I want you to understand the difference between not wanting to have sex with someone and regretting having sex with someone   I never wanted my boyfriend to take my virginity while fingering me at 16  but he never asked  I regret having sex with my coworker because now it's awkward and I wasn't over the moon about him so it ended quickly   You are absolutely NOT terrible  ugly  a slut or any of those things  Go to the police and be strong  then lawyer up  
It's not that though care  it's that they don't know how to help you  Depression is one of those things YOU have to work on  Other people can't solve this because they will never fully understand what the problem is because you probably don't understand it all yourself  If you just need someone to hear it  tell your friend or mom to just listen and not speak  Get it out 
I guess it's hard because with whatever mental illness I have  still learning about it    had for about 2 years at a degree in which I am dysfunctional  I have been unable to function   let alone move forward   Previous to that  I graduated high school with honors  went to junior college and after doing incredibly well there  was accepted to my dream university and graduated there with honors    It absolutely blows my mind how much I have changed since then  I cannot even imagine the energy I had and how much I got accomplished every day  And I was functional    I was normal  Now my brain chemistry is fucked  So sure  it is comparing myself to others     But it is more because I feel as though I am being left behind  I want to move on to the next stage in my life  and I am getting much older too boot  where the hell did this come from    too boot lol         and feel absolutely and entirely  stuck     Stuck  in that I cannot even keep my living space anything less than disgusting and trashed   Stuck  in that I go through periods of time that I  cannot for the life of me prevent  in which I become antisocial  cease all physical activity  creativity  basic work     I can't deal with stress  Make bad decisions  Pick my face bloody  And I  don't  want this  I am sincerely trying  But something is wrong  and   yea     
All the best brother  
Gosh  you make a good point   You say you  used  to be in my shoes      I suppose you can venture to guess what I am going to ask now   How did you get out of these shit shoes  Why is this past tense for you    And thank you so very much  I would like to believe in a higher power someday

Almost everybody here is saying the wrong thing Drawing isn't about perfecting a skill You must sit down and approach drawing valulelessly Never chuckk anyting you have ever done  drawing is just a bunch of lines right  Nothing can be better or worse they are are only what they are I guess that might be a small shame in drawing in a style that is the same as everyone else's  even tho most people would take a large pride in that if it was considered a style of high value like realism or something  But if you adopt this valueless style and just try and draw as fuck as much as you can then after a while or so you will develop something independent or that feels a reflection of yourself possibly But still you must follow the valueless rules  and just draw the first thing that comes into your head  don't worry about what to draw Because otherwise what's the point  right 
I'm really sorry  Please don't lose patience  That's what my father always says  Don't lose patience  Don't break down

Inboxed you   
i also had a lot of anxiety about traveling alone  the thing is you never know what you can do until you try  if you love to travel  some part of you does enjoy being in unfamiliar places   that's what traveling is  and honestly despite my fears  doing a 2 week overseas class through my uni literally changed my life  even tat short a time overseas on my own just completely opened up my world 
  
Just keep at it  Don't let yourself stop improving because of doubts or a rough time  Like when you feel worse then usual  take some time for yourself  Take a relaxing bath  watch one of your favorite movies  take a walk it is ok to avoid people if you want   I do   eat something yummy  eta   Important things Sleep   not enough can make it worse Maybe you need more then average because during sleep you work through some of your emotions   Exercise  It releases the good neurotransmitters in your brain Also proven to be very effective in helping with depression   Get Sun Vitamin D is needed "Unexplained fatigue" and "difficulty thinking clearly" are some symptoms caused by  lack of Vitamin D  https   en m wikipedia org wiki Vitamin D deficiency    Eat   Eat well A bad diet can affect everything

Thank you  This also teaches you how to live in the present reality  and not be caught up in the illusory future  
I've been where you are my friend  Things will get better  When I used to feel that way I play some uplifting music and do some Hobbies that make me happy  I always try to remember tomorrow is a new day where I can do better than today  It helps an I hope it can help you  
  "aren't we all a little depressed "  Maybe they're clinically depressed too and in denial   Dysthimia is a mild but persistent depression  It may not cripple a person but it's still a poor way to live  What's worse is that SSRIs don't appear to do much for mild depression

That's very sad that your parents do not believe your depression is real  Well  I believe you  and I don't think you are acting badly through being depressed  It means that you are hurting and that you have needs which aren't being met  and people need to care for you and respect you  Your parents are probably unable to empathize because when they were younger  their parents  or other adults  didn't empathize with them  That would explain their behaviour and maybe help you to feel compassion for them  but know that it's also okay to be angry at them    What exactly is the bedroom situation 
 Sorry  tried to reply in the proper place below but my computer's acting up    I know  right  It's the last thing you want to be told when you're feeling like hell with terrible OCD   'Just make a bunch of lifestyle changes you totally don't feel like doing right now and you'll get better'  There were days when mine was at its worst I couldn't do much except just lie there  shaking and crying  literally unable to get up or concentrate on anything  or think about anything except the fear  It wasn't easy to keep doing the healthy things I knew I ought to do  With exercise and stuff  it got to the stage where I would pretty much go do a workout video in my living room when a panic attack hit  and think sarcastically 'Wow  it's not like this is instantly making me feel better  but it's sure nice to have something to do while I panic '  I was pretty cynical  It's just that when you get to that fight or flight adrenalin stage  sometimes you do feel better if you literally run about and burn off all those stress chemicals   it's what your body was designed to do in that situation  it's harmless and it works  So yeah  I get what you mean about feeling hopeless  That's a totally legitimate emotion to have when OCD is taking you over  especially if a medication has been promoted to you with false hope and you were really wishing for something that would take these awful thoughts away   However  the situation isn't truly hopeless  I'm coming to the end of my recovery now  moving into that symptom free zone for a lot of the time now  I just need it to be more consistent and get a bit more resilient to stress again   and my head feels unbelievably improved  I'm at a stage I never thought I would get to  I just don't have intrusive thoughts anymore  really  only the very normal infrequent ones maybe once a day where you get a tiny unscary moment of 'hey  imagine if I dived off this bridge' or 'just think  I could stab my cat with the kitchen knife right now ' and it goes away immediately after  Apart from the lingering phobia residue of my old OCD theme  I'm not getting any thoughts that actually severely scare me  or barge into my head and stay there  repeating  Plus there's been positive personality changes and other changes to thinking   I feel more confident  less socially nervous  I doubt my viewpoint on big issues less excessively  I feel more sure when I take decisions  all of which feels REALLY good   And a lot of people told me it wasn't possible to get to this stage  So I guess   being hopeless wasn't an accurate way to be  because improvement has been so major   A couple of things that might work for you to combat hopelessness  since you ask     Rate your recovery progress using measureable scales  and keep a quick record of them each day  Like  you can rate the amount of distress you're feeling at any given time out of 10  the number of times a day you give in and do a compulsion  the amount of intrusive thoughts you get in one morning etc  It's VERY motivating to look back through a recovery progress record and think 'wow  a fortnight ago I was going through the whole day at a 6  10 distress  and that felt pretty scary  but today's been my first real 3  10 day and it feels much more relaxed ' And if you have a shitty day where it's easy to forget all your progress  look back over the recovery records and realise that even though this afternoon has been a really mean 7  10  yesterday morning was only a 3   10  and you can aim for that again     Try an OCD recovery podcast  especially one you can just pick a motivational talk from and listen to first thing in the morning  OCD experts Ali Greymond's and Mark Freeman's ones might be best for you  because they firmly hold that OCD is a fixable problem you can make a good recovery from  because they have this personal experience and they help coach other people who also have this experiencea  Ali's one  https   www youtube com watch v xoZSqI6kioo and Mark's   https   www youtube com watch v BMqV746A7bs    Lots of great advice from them and sometimes it can be motivating on dark days just to hear them talk about recovering  even if it's a podcast you've heard before     Breaking your recovery down into 24 hours at a time can help too  If you can't even imagine how you're ever going to feel ok with these terrible thoughts  just stick to the day ahead of you and say 'Ok  whatever else happens  for this day  I'm going to try my hardest to do the healthy stuff I need to do  like cutting out compulsions  getting enough sleep  and taking my meds  and try my hardest not to unhealthy stuff that'll make my OCD worse  like giving in to compulsions or ruminating ' That way  you know that however bad today is  tomorrow is very likely to be a little better  because every single day you manage to do the right things instead of the wrong things is another day that your brain can heal  If its overwhelming to think of yourself having to resist compulsions all day every day for the rest of your life  it won't really be like that  but it feels that way when you're really suffering   don't try and think of those big time frames  Just put it more like 'Can I do the right things for the next 24 hours '          
I said it was waste of time since I have still go through many many times before I get any medications  It fucking sucks to buildup a courage to get a time for one and only to be told "we will have to take further meetings   " 
I second what was already told  I suffer from depression and anxiety too and had panic attacks before  I always have with me a bottle of a mild anti anxiety med that was prescribed from my doctor and it saved me a lot of times  best course of action is to inform your doctor and see what can be done about it  Wish you luck   3
SNAFU  situation normal  all fucked up   I don't have any motivation for anything anymore  not for even the most basic things 
Anyway  I'm going to bed soon  and I just want to say again that whether you feel good  bad  or ugly  I care about you and am here to talk to you  in public or in private  For now I wish you    onnea   good luck   It is my belief that we can heal from any disease  mental or physical  and live in utopia  But life can be a huge struggle too  What you've said about how your family treats you sounds devastating  and again  it is very much understandable that you'd want to do whatever you can to end the pain  I hope your parents will understand how much they are hurting you and that they will want to figure out how to communicate kindly with you  In the meantime keep doing whatever brings you peace  whether that's playing a game  reading  going for a walk  sleeping  and try to be gentle with yourself whenever you are suffering  You're not just faking  you're a good person  and you deserve to be loved completely  always  Take care    
I don't agree with the "women live on easy mode" thing  but using a joke as an argument is idiotic as the thing op said  This isn't even true  just look the statistics

My heart aches for you  man    My condolences to you and your family    I guess the best advice I could give you is to be there as much as you possibly can for your father and sister    Be sure to go through your grieving process  get through it however you can but be sure to cherish the life your mother gave you  she'd want you to be happy no matter what  
Thank you for this  I woke up this morning read this and now feel so much less anxious about my day  
It is NOT your fault  It will NEVER be your fault  Please  please  please do not feel guilty  It will only make you feel worse  It is shocking what has happened and it seems surreal losing a parent like that  I wish you the best  the next couple of months will probably be harder as you adjust  But never stop  Keep going  Deep breathe  exhale  clear your mind  you've got your whole life to live  Keep going for her  
Hey  I've been taking 200mg of sertraline a day for 9 years  It takes a little while to work  but it makes a huge difference  Good luck  stay positive

Flaming around on reddit is quite entertaining   You should try it out 
I also want to help you  if you want to talk you can send me a pm 
Agreed  it's a hell yes from me 
It's weird because I used to be strictly panic based  I would have frequent panic attacks   I almost kinda yearn for those days because at least it wasn't constant 
I'd recommend telling all of this to the doctor who prescribed it to you   In fact  just cut and paste this into an email to the doctor  assuming you have their email address   You may just need a different dosage  or you may need a different med   What works for one person may do nothing for the next  it's not you it's just the way things are   And  it's probable that a med is only part of the solution for you   Don't give up  it's really worth finding what works for you 
I already tried that  but the problem is that she keeps coming into my mind  because I am so used to it  Can't get her off my mind

I read many books about cognitive behavioral therapy and law of attraction  Collectively this led me to make the decision that  1  I am not a victim of my condition and I will get out of it  I take 100  responsibility for my thoughts and actions   2  I change my thinking habit bit by bit from negative to positive   Making decision means you really decide to do everything you can control for change  I would like to give you a magic trick but there was none  I just made a decision and start to change  You can do this in the next minute  And if you can flip that switch once  you can do it again and again  Next thing you know  you are normal

Yeah    I just tried it with eating  literally just went into my kitchen and asked  'what will make me feel better'  And have since started eating some chickpeas  And I do already feel a little better  Seems intuition has something going for it 
Thanks for this    sorry that you're dealing with it as well
Yes  I've had these thoughts too    A lot of it always goes back to the government for me  They are trying to poison me and everyone else and downplay our abilities    And the Truman show is just a mind fuck  Lolol  
Can so relate  I'm too busy living in my imaginary world to participate in reality  It's hard  Sometimes even think why go outside and do something when my fantasy will always be 10x better 
To make my point more clear I will give you an example of taking responsibilities for my thoughts and actions and change them bit by bit   Suppose you caught yourself thinking  I am depressed therefore I cannot be successful  my brain is messed up   You will then take a piece of paper and write down the thoughts  Then you will write a counter thought  For example  write "If I want to be successful I have to stop entertaining this belief that I cannot be successful because my brain is messed up  People with that type of beliefs cannot be successful  In fact  I believe that although I have not figured it all out yet  there's a way for me to become better  To have better attitude  To love myself again  And if I keep changing my thoughts deliberately  I will build the necessary mental habits  I will be alright "   At first  it's like forcing yourself to write down things you don't believe in  but over time  trust me  the positive thoughts will become your new normal 
i am in the exact same situation  even 10 years  you know that corny cliche saying   when one door closes  another opens   but were too stuck looking at the closed door    i think that applies in this case  baby steps 
I think it's important for people with anxiety to find a job where they are surrounded by mostly kind and positive people   I have quite severe generalised anxiety disorder   I struggle to leave the house without panic attacks  new things are incredibly difficult for me and require lots of preparation and relaxation in advance  etc   and I graduated university in the first half of last year  thank god for being able to work from home   I was terribly scared that I wouldn't survive employment  But I mustered my courage up and just threw myself out there  and I will admit that I got very lucky    I ended up in a job where everybody I have contact with is pleasant  and the atmosphere is very relaxed  I've been here since July and I have had only a handful of very bad anxiety attacks   which for me  is extremely good  Jobs with fast changing environments  lots of travel  lots of customer facing time such as retail  probably aren't as good for anxiety as a "behind the scenes" job   I feel like you need to find work where you can rest assured that people are comfortable if you make mistakes every now and again  We can all try our best at our jobs and still make mistakes because we are only human  and it's important to note that being berated can be very damaging to someone with anxiety   It also probably helps to try and find work in something you are passionate about doing   for me it is computing and I am continually fascinated and immersed by what I do on a day to day basis  which is a great way for me to relax and take my mind off my anxiety

This is one of the ones I'm having a harder time getting over  Where I think our mental illness is actually a strength of some form  Or something completely different than an illness  and more of an unlocked special ability    Really really glad this post helped you   3
I really hope it works but I also hope you don't get your hopes up to much on the first try  It can take several weeks to find the right dosage and maybe the right combination of drugs  Good luck though I hope you find what you need  
Not conspiracy like  It's a legitimate question   THC cannabis often causes bad anxiety  it can make you delusional but it can also definitely clear the way for real memories and things to appear to you  And that can be scary   I ate too much edibles last summer  and something similar to what you're talking about did happen  I did feel very anxious at points  uncomfortable  and got quick flashes of insight as to what happened to me  Revelations which are now just barely remembered because I was so high and because it's hard to retain high memories  They weren't memories per se  though  more just thoughts realizations about why I had a certain phobia  for instance  Putting pieces together and realizing the details of what might have happened to me   But I've never had concrete memories of what happened to me and so I'm still in the dark and going off of symptoms and feelings and random revelations but no hard "evidence "  Anyway  long story short  I think it can definitely help  but it's not for everyone  and the anxious state it often provokes is probably not going to make for a pleasant experience when you're already having a flashback to these kinds of memories

Whatever you do  don't mess with your dosage   stick to it for the next 2 months diligently   FYI  From the national alliance on mental illness   "Sleep  energy  or appetite may show some improvement within the first 1 2 weeks  Improvement in these physical symptoms can be an important early signal that the medication is working  Depressed mood and lack of interest in activities may need up to 6 8 weeks to fully improve "
Same here  I managed to clean up somewhere from August through to November  But December has been a massive come down  So here I go again  I need something I can stick with which always keeps me going  I already exercise sleep well and eat well  but I need that extra belief in something that'll move me onto the next level of living and experience 
It's a mix of being envious of them and feeling that they are empty for finding happiness in such average things 
Hope you feel better soon   Today I'll be swimming 3k and then going to my first martial arts class in years  I'm excited 
Deepest condolences on your terrible loss  I know it's hard to do  but try to be kind to yourself right now  Allow yourself time to grieve in your own way  Take care  Again  I am sorry for your loss 
I'm getting back into jump rope this year  I haven't done it in at least 4 years and yesterday  Monday  I had my first session to re familiarize myself with it  Boy  I had completely forgotten how demanding it is   For Wednesday the plan is to lift weights at home but depending on how things go I may go for a run instead  My anxiety was triggered this evening and it has me worried for my future  I've sent my therapist a message to schedule an appointment  I hope he's back in town  but if the anxiety wave doesn't subside by tomorrow running will be easier for me to get into that weights   Backup plans   
Oh man  I can't begin to imagine how you're feeling right now  We had a similar situation some two years ago  my mom had a blood sugar level of nearly 800  but she survived  However  I was too much in shock when I heard about it  to call  visit or even talk to her after she was back home  To this day I keep hating myself for doing so  BUT I believe she understands  And I believe  no I'm sure  your mom understands too  wherever she is right now  Noone ever imagines such a situation  and if it's there  it's all too quickly for you to react  Please  don't give yourself any fault in this  and rest assured your mom is not mad at you or anything  She's still loving you the same  and will be very proud of every little achievment you accomplish in your life 
I'm so sorry you have to go throufh that  A friend of mine attempted suicide  but he fortunately didn't succeed  You may also want to visit  r SuicideBereavement  
personally  meds were worth the time and effort it took to find the right combination   While it did take some trial and error in order to get to the right conclusion  I feel as if I am much better than previous   It is a guess and check sort of situation most of the time  so the best thing that you can do if you do start taking meds is be completely honest about any negative side effects and let the doctor weigh them against the positives   
I find that dogs are even better They love you so unconditionally 
have you tried switch meds or upping the dose 
I repeat  THIS IS NOT YOUR FAULT  It's normal to feel like you do  but please please please understand it is not your fault in anyway  Go and tell someone  
You sound alot like me  I went from 170 lbs to 120 lbs over the last 3 years just from anxiety and inability to eat  I've had emetophobia since I was 8  I'm 35 now   The thing that finally helped my emetophobia was anxiety meds and therapy  no joke  With me I have a fear that certain foods will trigger a reaction  making a reaction more likely to happen just due to the panic attack symptoms  So I avoid foods in general if they make me anxious  To make matters worse I have GERD and IBS which create symptoms and feed the emetophobia   The things that really helped me was finding the right meds for my anxiety  mainly the SSRIs  Cipralex  and  Benzos for anxiety panic  Clonazepam   I also take Domperidone for gut motility and Zofran for nausea  very expensive   Plus  the usual assortment of over the counter meds  Pepto bismol  Maalox  Zantac  Diovol  etc    I also eat lots of healthy priobiotics  sauerkraut  kefir  kombucha  and drink copious amounts of herbal tea  ginger  fennel  peppermint     Therapy is also very important  whether that's group therapy and or one on one counselling  I try to get as much as I can  I find it very helpful when dealing with my anxiey depression emetophobia  Just getting out of the house and having people to socialize with is very important  don't isolate yourself like I did for 10 years  until recently    I also do a lot of deep breathing  relaxation techniques  exercise yoga  distraction  etc   to try and reduce stress and anxiety  For me sleep is also very important  if I don't get a good sleep I'm sick the entire next day  So  I try to practice healthy sleeping habits  get off computer by 6 8pm  and then relax the remainder of night  keep a regular sleeping schedule  etc        tldr    From my experience the main thing is getting that anxiety in check  Once you manage the anxiety the emetophobia fear should come down with it  For me that means therapy  SSRIs  and benzos  Every person is different though  what worked for me might not work for you  There's a very strong anxiety emetophobia connection though in my opinion   
Jacqueline is right  practice is key  I could barely play in tune when I started  I've known people with dyspraxia learn to play guitar  even helped teach one or two  not that I'm a magical teacher who knows everything about guitar    Start with power chords and slower songs then pick up the pace over time  incidently metal core with all its 1s and 0s can be an okay place to start

I'm prescribed Wellbutrin SR 150mg  Setinin 25mg  and Lamictal 25mg  When I take any type of medication  I usually don't experience drowsiness but these make me tired  Really tired  I'm supposed to take the last 2 at bedtime but that shit makes my body so tired  I can't even describe it  Like my mind is awake and active but my body becomes progressively number and number it becomes incredibly frustrating  I can't go to sleep at all when I experience this  I despise taking meds so I think that's affecting it's effects on my progress  
Several other people are saying the same  And even if she's telling the truth  no  especially then  she should be advised to seek help from trustworthy adults and or the police  Letting her post here for hours while any potential evidence of the crime is decaying isn't doing anyone any favors  Especially not the next victim of those guys 
I've never really understood why so many people think going to a movie theater is a group thing    You're sitting there in a dark room  not talking  ignoring the people around you  attention focused on he screen in front of you  Nothing about that seems like a social activity to me   I've been going to the movies alone for years  It's the only way to do it  if you ask me   Go during the day or early afternoon and the theater is usually empty  you get you pick of the seats and plenty of room on either side of you 
Same  I can't think of anything that would satisfy me  which I could live off of   With that said  it's not like I know for sure things won't get better  It would have been easier if I was never born  but since I'm born anyway I think it's better to live on even if it sucks because things might get better and it would really be a mistake to not go further by killing yourself  I mean  some people are living a happy life right  I'm sure there is a way somehow for us too to live a happy life  we just haven't found it yet 
Kind of funny story I want to add on here about what helped me realize my delusions  and what delusions actually are    So  when I went to the doctor to get on my meds I was talking to my psych and I was saying  'I have delusions  My delusion is that I think every person in my life at some point hates me  My mom  my boyfriend  my friends  everyone doesn't want me in their life '   And he said  ' Those are not delusions  Delusions are things that are out of possibility  Something like the government is following you  aliens  conspiracy theories  alternate realities  Those are delusions  Everyone not liking you is a real possibility'   And I know I sat there with the blankest look on my face after that because 1  He just told me everyone very well may not like me    Which is actually true because of the path of self destruction I continue to go on in my ups and downs  I do things to make people not like me sometimes   But obviously that didn't really settle well with me upon impact  So 2  I'm sitting there like  'Well this guy is brainwashed idiot '   It took SO LONG for me to start thinking      Maybe I should think about that some more  Lol  Like I say it's still very much an issue  but I'm on my meds and working through it  And maybe my psych's definition can help someone else out there  Love you guys  And Happy 2017   3 
Hey  I imagine you're getting enough 'I can't imagine how you're feeling's and 'remember it's not your fault's  so I'll just send my love and most positive thoughts I can muster in your general direction  I hope you all have the strength to keep each other going  and even if we're just a bunch of faceless usernames on the internet  we still care a ton about you  Hang in there friend    
Well  any suggestions   Seriously   I'm completely lost in every direction    This is the closest thing I can afford to therapy    So  I figured I had nothing left to lose    Also I appreciate you taking the time to read everything  
I'm so sorry to hear that  sending my love your way  I hope you manage to stay as strong as is reasonable given the circumstances  And thank you for your words as well  honestly  I find it so easy to worry about the state of my life and what I'm doing and how I'm not improving  but I guess it is important to just   exist  even if I can't do anything else 
My mom has decided to take him back  so yeah
Just hang in there bud  hopefully tomorrow will be an up day for you 
You're really going to throw your life away for a girl    think with your head  not with your heart

It takes 2 weeks on average for most anti depressants to build up enough in your system to start working  Keep at it  even when it feels like it isn't working  You should start to see some improvement after 2 1 2 weeks 
I can't wait for the day when we can send physical hugs over the internet  but for now a virtual one will have to suffice             Thinking of you  hope you're doing okay   
Please do discuss it with your therapist   There are lots of different meds available and hopefully you can find something that works for you 
Call the police first

I know this sounds like a very standard response  and I understand if it annoys you to hear it  but have you seen a therapist psychologist  I say this not because it's a default suggestion for mental illness  but because I think it can actually help with working through where this stuff is coming from and how you can change it  I've found myself more interested in super violent and gory films and videos recently  and talking through why I'm drawn to these things and what I feel it gives me with someone professional I hope is helping me to address whatever it is in my mind that's underlying this
I was a way chronic smoker as a teen  also drugs  First psychotic episode at 22   it was bad  I didn't feel like myself for almost two years when I gradually started smoking weed again  It definitely led to my next psychotic episode  hospitalized 3 months  No weed for 20 years  functioned ok  Started smoking  felt weird at first  bad reactions  but kept smoking  after a year  another severe psychotic episode   bad  I'm positive weed led to these  2 bad psychotic episodes for me  I learned my lesson and won't smoke ever again  I'm on disability for life  Every psychotic episode does something to your brain  makes bipolar worse  I can't have another one   I wish I never started weed or drugs  I'm sure my bipolar wasn't helped by it

I'm nearly 20 and haven't dated anyone either   I also have no friends      I don't really know what to do  I can't put myself out there because I'm not really sure what that means  for one  and even if it literally means "just go outside" exactly what am I supposed to be doing out there  Hang out with my no friends   I don't know  apparently that's the end all of the situation "put yourself out there " thread over    Anyway  I'm lonely AF  if you want to talk about being a horrible failure  PM me  I can relate 
I'v had it since February 2016  it's is honestly pure nightmare  But just remember it is not dangerous in anyway  But with anxiety it really feeds the loop  I sent you a PM with a link to a guide to help you through it  
May I ask why you are switching 
Because it took so long for me to get diagnosed I can honestly say without marijuana I don't know where I would be today  I understand where it can make some peoples paranoia way worse  but I've learned to deal with the paranoia because I know it's only because I just smoked  And even if I do get paranoid when it goes away Im calm and it does what I need  And it's really is all about the strains too  Sativa strains are great during depression when you need to get up and start doing something  Indica strains are great when Im all manicy and need eat  go to sleep  and need to chill    I'm starting my medication now though and hoping that I might be able to ween off once I'm not going up and down so rapidly anymore    Really do love it though  Wish they would legalize it and do more studies on it  
Actually  one of the things I hate most is when people say "Just get rid of those thoughts  be happy" and then just ignore real problems or make them worse   Thanks for sharing this  it actually helps when people show empathy  is because of people like you that I don't give up  there's a world worth fighting for  not all are assholes   
it did nothing much for me it felt kinda chill but boring chill 
You definitely did the right thing  
I've given up trying to find a solution to my generalised anxiety disorder long ago   but I never stop fighting to stay ahead of it  It feels so good for me to do something challenging that requires me to face my anxiety head on  aka almost everything  and win   Treatment or not  don't let it control you lovely people  It's all worth it in the end 
I was on wellbutrin and it didn't do anything for me  I'm also on lamictal  which is my life saver  it has truly changed my life and has helped with my moods
You can try writing to make your characters come alive  I've been doing that for some time and it's helping to distract me from life even though I suck at writing lol
Hmmm  I wanted an IUD again and my GYN said skyla is easier less painful and he prefers the for women who haven't had children  I didn't have a very good time getting Morena inserted so it sounds nicer I suppose   The mirena was inserted in    2010  2011   I have been on the pill since I had the mirena out and I'm not a fan of it  tbh   I had the mirena out because it was almost time and I was getting cysts that were benign but painful  I think the skyla is also lower hormones  don't quote me   which should help the cysts

Personally i feel medicine is good if you are really really out of it  but i find it very hard to work on the anxiety when i can't feel it    For me i started getting medicine for it  I was so fucked from anxiety that i was crippled mentally  after that  i had a good run with meds for some time  but i don't want to take meds the rest of my life so i weened off them but the anxiety came back 10fold   this is my experience and will not be the same for others  I had nothing  no tools to calm myself with or anything  i decided not to take any meds so i could learn to calm myself when i got a bad episode  I have GAD with some panic attacks  panic attacks i haven't had in a long while     When you are on meds and don't get help like a psyciatrist or something like that  you have nothing to withstand the anxiety when off them  Imho 
The question here is    which one of us is the clone 
This is exactly the way I feel about work it's as if work has created this problem for me in the first place

I feel like there is no going back  I believe I will deal with this all my life  be it the symptoms  or like you say the darkness of it all  I'm not saying we are doomed but it'll always be a part of us  I think you develop a new perspective on thing  maybe a more cynical or distant one  to protect yourself    It doesn't mean life can't be enjoyed but you sure don't forget  The pain we experience d  clashes with our happy moments  The world is just    different  It can become an opportunity for growth and wisdom  I'm still debating if the pain was the cause of my growth as a good person  
What device are you actually using  I've worn 3 different heart rate monitors at the gym one day while doing this free training class and they were all drastically different  
I have a good cup of coffee or tea  I read  listen to music  maybe watch an upbeat show or movie  I make plans and goals   Sometimes it helps just to remind yourself of where you are  and what you have   Chances are you're better off than most of the rest of the world's citizens   Sometimes just being thankful you got through another day without being a "statistic "

Yeah  Since 2012 I don't go out much  I'll go out when I need food or quick stops to pick up something I purchased but if it can be avoided I'd rather not  Not really convinced that I'm missing out on much with the way the world is these days  Scary to even drive in my city anymore with how crazy people are  I'd probably go out a lot more if I could afford to live somewhere I'd like to live  
I'm so sorry this happened to you  You have nothing to be ashamed of  It sounds like you were extremely intoxicated and he took advantage of you  He is the one who needs to feel sorry for his actions not you  No one has the right to force sex on someone who was clearly unconscious  You are allowed to feel however you want to  I don't think it's helpful if you try be "forget" this  You need to talk about how you feel and talk through it with someone you trust  these things are easier when shared  
Yeah  I do think it is lower in hormones  But it also lasts less long and is less likely to stop your period  My gyn was all "um    I am supposed to tell you to get skyla since you've never been pregnant    but    personally I think that's a bunch of crap and I insert mirena for women who have never been pregnant all the time "
I agree with this comment  You never know when your hypomania could turn into full blown mania too  So just make sure your talking to your psych about it    And yes  I'm triggered by movies  television  youtube  news articles  pretty much everything  Worst one is youtube for me  Lol
Whenever I smoke weed I get nervous  anxious and can't eat  I also think about all of the shortcomings I have caused and it generally makes me feel out of wit with myself   Sort of the same thing  I think chemically it's just not out thing  I can't do anything lol  Meanwhile all my friends excel while high   Let's quit together  
Sorry you're hurting  The fact that she's dating somebody else already makes me think this has less to do with your shortcomings and you're blaming yourself too much  Obviously she's too afraid to ever be alone and show some respect to the marriage that isn't even officially over yet if she has to be with somebody else already  So gross when people do that    Realized I misread your post at first and having a son taken from you was a previous situation  not this one  Sounds like you could also benefit from committing to spending a few years single and worrying about getting yourself feeling better before you find yourself in another relationship    Read about No Contact and why that's the best thing for you right now  If it's over it's over  Communicate with her only as much as you need to in order to get the divorce over with  Don't keep tabs on whatever else she is up to with social media or anything else  Are there children from this relationship  If not  make it a clean break with as little drama as possible   As far as how to feel better  it's all too fresh now  but you'll get there  You'll get there faster by doing No Contact and getting the situation sorted out as quickly as possible  Treat it as a business deal that needs to be done  don't get emotional or share any feelings with her  There's nothing to be salvaged in a situation where she's already dating somebody else  
I'm currently on medication for my Generalized Anxiety Disorder  I am so glad I finally sought medical help  I was lucky and the first one I was put on did the trick  I did experience a sensation of having drank 10 cups of coffee in an hour to begin with when I was easing myself into the medication and saw my Doctor again who suggested I continue with half doses a bit longer before going with the whole dose and that did the trick 
It's not a case of it being hard to win as it is the crime being hard to prove unless there's sufficient evidence   The system isn't in place to screw victims over but to be as fair as possible and sadly rape is hard to prove unless there's DNA evidence and or witness' or recorded evidence or other such open and examinable things to show beyond a reasonable doubt the accused is guilty
  fan  It's great that you have a process that works for you though  Setting a minimum is a great way to challenge yourself of the days where its extra difficult  The point is you're sticking with it  
Very nice  I agree with the sentiment  Most times trying to remain calm and peaceful and letting the crazy world go on around me is enough to keep me going  but sometimes the darkness still manages to creep in  
I get these all the time  from grinding my teeth at night sometimes I catch my tongue or sides of my cheek and then I get a bump  Sometimes it's s little on the big size too like a dime even  Maybe smaller   Not sure exactly what you mean by thinner and thicker  I don't think I could tel that    And wisdom teeth suck  Especially if they are impacted or coming in weird  Could all be from that  Just ask your dentist at your next cleaning  They can do a swift X ray and confirm they messed up to all hell  
It's the best series I'll ever see   You should really consider watching it
Good luck  
I refuse to believe that  Thats depression talking 
Impressive list of things you've already tried  but then to get to the end and see your awareness that you don't like the path you're on and don't care to finish the 7 months of classes you have left  I would imagine that might be why all those other things didn't work  Diet and exercise might improve the mood of somebody who is just generally down in the dumps  but has little to with realizing you don't like the path that you're on  Simplest solutions are usually the best  You don't like where you're going  so aim elsewhere  Doesn't sound good to me trying to medicate yourself into wanting something that you don't want  Beyond that  I don't know how to address the lack of motivation to make the changes  That is something I struggle with too  I do things on a daily basis that I know aren't taking me where I want to go  
That's so cool  I wish my FMIL was as thoughtful and kind  
I have been where you are now and I can tell you one thing   it does get better  From your post I am getting that you feel like you don't really know who you are  This distressed me for many years and I have one big piece of advice for you  if that is how you feel   I never did find out those things that I was missing  and that you are missing  Instead  I accepted it as a part of my life that I would use as a "clean slate" to try and find new things to pursue  I feel like this might help you  Try new stuff  Search hard for those interests  You don't have to do a million things at once  But if you focus all your energy into doing something new  one thing at a time  you just might find yourself in a much better place   Where you are right now is only temporary  and you can't blame yourself for what others want for you  like your parents  It's okay for what  you  want and what your parents want to be very different   and if they don't understand or see that now  all you can do is hope that they do with time  You are not living your life for them  you are living it for you  never forget that   Around this time two years ago I felt like you feel now  Then I started just  doing stuff  Not quickly  I could only muster up so much courage because of my anxiety  but I would try new things when I felt positive enough to do so  After just a few months  I tried riding a motorcycle for the first time  It was one of the scariest experiences of my life  But it really clicked with me  I felt the same anxiety as I did doing everything else  but I felt something else too    The next two years that followed until now I have centred my entire life around that interest  I'm like an entirely different person  Finding something to do that you like can have a profound effect on you as a character  and there's always the bonus of meeting new people too  Being  excited  to go and do something  or to be a part of something  is a great motivator  And I wish I could help you find what your calling is  or find the motivation to chase it  but only you can help you with that   Ultimately  my advice is to use this time where you are feeling lost to develop yourself as a person  Instead of searching for pieces that you think should be there  have a shot at creating some new pieces  It could end up leading you on an amazing adventure  and I really hope it does  And even if you still don't know what you're going to do and feel stuck  focus on the excitement of finding out 
Always something I have struggled with  When you have very few friends from the start  it's easy to keep forgiving bad behavior when you feel like it's either bad friends or no friends at all  But obviously there's no point in keeping something in our lives once it has a larger negative effect than a positive one  so you just have to try to gauge that somehow   If someone is hurting your feelings or disappointing you more often than they bring any light into your life  it might be time to let that go   As far as what to do about it  sometimes nothing is best  You don't really have to make it a grand official gesture and tell them that the friendship is over  If they've been a crappy friend in the first place  chances are if you just distance yourself and talk to them less they probably won't even notice you're gone for a while  Unless you definitely want the certainty and closure of knowing that bridge is burned for good  then you could tell them or message them somehow and tell them why you feel the way you do and what you've decided to do about it   Of course the middle ground in there somewhere is that you could try to tell them how they hurt you and see if the relationship can be salvaged somehow  but that depends on if you think they're the type of person who will give two shits to listen to what you have to say  
Getting out into nature  Which is hard to do since it requires time and effort  Hiking some trails or going to sit by a river has never failed to make me feel better  Kind of a limited option during the colder months  
In those times  just remember  you are loved and important to somebody  Even if you don't know it  Your small talk or conversion with your local grocer could be the highlight of their day and the thing they look forward to in their job   You have an impact on more people than you think and there is nothing wrong with reaching out to others when you are weathered by the hardships of life   Hang in there mate and I wish your aspirations and dreams come to fruition in 2017 
I've been trying to do this as well by speaking positivity into existence  I tell myself daily I'll have a great day and won't let anything get me down  So far  my mood has been better    Best of luck on your journey  friend  
Sounds like he's living a pretty awesome life for a bachelor  but yeah that's a bit strange for a married man  But depending on your age it's not really your place to say anything  If you're living with them or they pay for things  you have even less of a platform to stand on    It's not really up to you to try to figure out what label or disorder you want to apply to him  Saying you want a surefire way to resolve your issues with him once and for all  this isn't really the way to go about it  As you alluded to  him having a willingness to attend therapy or something like that would probably benefit everyone  but if he won't he won't  Nobody on Reddit should read a few paragraphs from you and be able to say "yup  he's depressed"  Any number of things could be going on  If he's successful enough that he's bringing in money while living that lifestyle  well damn  good for him  I'd probably tell people to leave me the hell alone too if I could get away with living like that   Ultimately the person more in a position to be trying to figure out what's going on here is your mom  It's her husband and she should want to figure it out of it's making the entire family unhappy  Your only choice is get along in whatever way makes that possible  If he's that wrapped up in his computer all day  go about your own business  worry about having a good relationship with your mom  and keep things short and sweet when you see him  I guess  They'll always have that trump card that if you complain about things too much  to tell you that you just shouldn't be living there then    Relationships are 2 way streets  There's no way you can aim to repair this all by yourself  He'd have to want a better relationship with his family as well  All you could do is maybe write him a letter or something and tell him how this troubles you and how much you'd like to have a better relationship  as much as he doesn't exactly sound approachable about something like that  and then it's out of your hands  
Yes  My anxiety comes and goes  But it has been almost unmanageable the last two months ever since I accepted a new position in the company  I work in an large retail chain  I went from a position that kept me largely in the backroom to out front in the optical center  I took the job because it was more money and everyone told me how much they enjoy it  Long story short  it's a nightmare for me  The doctors I work in conjunction with frighten me to no end I'm constantly worried I'm going to screw something up and get fired  There are way too many times I am left alone in the department even though there are many tasks I haven't learned how to do yet  and once more  I'm terrified of messing something up  When patients come in to get their glasses adjusted I'm frightened of breaking them and my hands shake so bad that I have trouble doing the simplest of adjustments  Before work I have trouble eating anything because I gag  During work I am both hungry and want to throw up   It is so bad I have asked to return to my old position for less money  I feel like a colossal failure and disappointment but I have to do what is right by my health  I will most likely be seeing a counselor again when I return to my old job to work on my confidence issues and my poor management of stress  But after this  this is the last time I'm going to try to move up in the company  I would prefer to just be done with customer service all together and find a job elsewhere 
are you envious of their ability to find happiness in average things 
honestly i wish i could give you advice  i wish i could tell you to just run away from all of this and start over  but i dont know if that's possible   or is it 
http   well blogs nytimes com 2010 06 16 exploring the links between depression and weight gain 
I completely relate  Everything appears to be great on paper but all I can seem to think about is being let go or replaced  I still need to figure out how to explain my diagnosis to HR but my fear of it being too late to disclose is pushing me in the direction of a talk with my therapist about it soon    Keep being awesome at work and sorry for the fear  You're not alone 
I remember losing my Dad four years a go  It was just before Christmas  He was ill for a long time but we had convinced ourselves he would get better  I had the same reaction as you  I was in utter shock but knew I had to keep it together for my family  I feel for you and hope you have the strength to soldier onwards  We all know we have a limited time here and that's why we need to make the most of it  Please don't let it defeat you  instead use it as an energy to fuel your way through life  
maybe you're right 
Oh my goodness    thats terrible    I hope that it works out for you  hang in there 
Thanks very much  Interesting read    
honestly same
escaping depression  i think  its a long  arduous journey but seeing my gf complete it inspires me to keep pushing too
Ouch  
I wrote this a few minutes ago to somebody else  But I think it may apply to you as well        In these times  just remember  you are loved and important to somebody  Even if you don't know it  Your small talk or conversion with your local grocer could be the highlight of their day and the thing they look forward to in their job   You have an impact on more people than you think and there is nothing wrong with reaching out to others when you are weathered by the hardships of life   Hang in there mate and I wish your aspirations and dreams come to fruition in 2017          If you ever want to talk  just hit me up  I am slowly working through my own problems and have been battling depression for some years now   I am only 25  so I don't have much in the way of life experience and may not be able to provide you with the advice needed or what you want  but I'm objective to your situation and I am happy to help in whatever I can  even if you just need to vent or talk to somebody 
Before you ask  no  this isn't a shady way of saying "I"  But my friend has a relationship for literallybone day  Now he has hard time getting over it 
Our ancestors developed mechanisms that are subconscious but were and are essential for our survival  That is why most people can depend on their feelings of fear  anxiety or what is called "impending doom"  they're there to keep us safe and warn us of possible danger after all  The problem with anxiety as a disorder is that our "system" is NOT working properly  it's oversensitive and therefore we cannot depend on it without questioning  If you're bleeding  hurt or there's anything wrong with your body or situation in general then yeah  you definitely want to take it seriously  otherwise it's just your brain being wrong again  
Currently on 100mg of sertraline  don't give up hope if it takes a while to work  Pay attention to how you feel while on it  side effects can happen  shouldn't be major though   Also  at least for me  do NOT forget to take it when you get in the habit of taking it daily  When I forget a day  I get this buzzy like dizzy feeling  and get extremely nauseous  Good luck 
Oh please  as long as there is another person on this planet she'd take them over me 
That's great to see how assertive you are  even with anxiety under pressure  Just more of a reason to know that you're strong willed and kind     
i could probably draw anything with enough references but i wouldnt draw it good  that's for sure   if youre determined  my submitted history has some various art things submitted to subreddits
Hey fuckface  you still around 
heyyy that's one more gf than I've ever had 
Audiobooks  I think most libraries can loan out audiobooks now   Damn  that's impressive  I've always wanted to write but just haven't gotten around to it 
Sounds to me like you've worked your way through a good chunk of this journey and maybe you're just too caught up in wanting this to be the end already when you aren't quite there  You have the insight to be able to list the improvements you've made and also the things that you know you haven't tackled yet  At least having that information gives you an advantage compared to somebody who might be feeling down but can't pinpoint why    You're two days into dropping another bad habit  you say you're still uncovering and working through some abuse experiences  you know you have room to improve in diet and exercise   As they say  you have to try to appreciate the journey and not just yearn for the destination  No  I don't think where you are now is "as good as it gets"  I think you are well on your way to it continuing to get better and better  But in life there probably never is a distinguishable end zone  aside from the grave  Don't look at this as some end point that you're trying to get to  You'll be on this journey for the rest of your life  You have a pretty long list of things you've already improved and it sounds like your mind tends to downplay those things and instead focus on whatever else hasn't happened yet    I've dealt  still dealing  with narcissism in my family and sadly pretty much understand it'll be an emotional scar for life  It is hard to connect with other people when you know they can't ever understand what it was like    Getting the blood work done was a really smart idea as many people never make the connection that there can be something physically wrong that contributes to moods and mental states  Getting any information back about any deficiencies you might have is just one more big step you're taking that will continue to make things better    I think you're doing awesome  Sounds like you just have that all too familiar negative attitude that comes from having lived in the shadow of a narcissist    I really need to get to work on watching what I eat and getting back to exercise  As expected  it's January 3rd and I still haven't gotten started  You're not the only one not looking forward to making those changes  I'll see if I can make an effort today  maybe you can too  Even if it's just going for a walk  A lot of times getting your heart rate up and getting some oxygen to your brain is a huge boost for mood  
It's different for me  I see a lone person  and I immediately get curious about them  The quiet ones are often the most brightest  But I get scared that they might not want someone prying into their lives  And the other thing  what if they get dependent on me  I won't be able to handle that  I don't cling  I don't want anyone to cling to me either  But just that feeling of having people to back you  while you back them as well  Sometimes  rarely  I do end up making small talk  hoping  that if they are interested  maybe they'll ask me a question or two  back as well  
I need them   But nobody will give them to me   Cutting myself helps though so that's the only thing I can do right now 
I used to have some really odd nightmares when I first started talking about the sexual assault I experienced  It's only recently that they have died down and I haven't had one for a long while  I've just finished specialist counselling and the link with the nightmares for me was control and power  My nightmares where usually unrelated to my abuser or the assault but the theme was very much linked  The counselling really helped as it helped get the stuff out of my head and express the anger and sense of loss I felt about the part of me that was gone   I also found getting a pillow with a small speaker in helped as I could play relaxation exercises or music through it  I also discovered the sleep with me podcasts  which are deliberately dull  meandering podcasts that give a focus to your thoughts without being stimulating  I got my pillow off amazon and I just plug my iPod into it and play stuff  I haven't needed to in a while but it's a good fallback if I find my dreams getting disturbed again 
You need to do what you believe is best for yourself  If that means a ptsd program  fantastic  If it means having your parents turned over to the authorities  so be it  Do whatever you think will help you  That being said  look into every option  Examine the pros and cons  I'm sorry that you are suffering and I hope you press on and prevail through this situation  Good luck 
god i hate having such a brilliant idea in my head trapped in a prison that my hands cant unlock  its so deeply frustrating
I'm from Canada  P but seriously  don't worry about finding the dream job and then everything is solved  There are always problems  It's okay to have a job that sucks with decent coworkers that puts food in your mouth and to live for your hobbies  
I was going through something like this yesterday  but I don't know how I snapped out of it  Sometimes I'm sure that my own depression is linked to my diet  the more I eat a balanced diet the better ability that I have to get out of the fog 
You can absolutely get through  I'm so proud of you for getting out and for starting therapy  It will take time but keep at it  Things will get better 
Yeah  same for me   My parents had me in "therapy" but it was really just an attempt to get me to talk about what they wanted me to talk about   I don't think it actually benefitted me at all until I did it on my own and got to set the expectations 
I have been on medications for 12 years or so  and I wouldn't be alive if it weren't for medications  I have ADHD  anxiety  OCD  and depression   If you find the right medication  it won't cause side effects like a mind fog    Good luck  
Apple Watch gave me the 178bpm spike while walking  Polar H7 gave me the 17bpm while resting a few hours later  Wasn't using them at the same time  
Yes  I'm so glad I'm never the only one   I started my job in September  This is my first full time position because I graduated college at the end of July  I felt so out of place because everyone in my office is so close knit  and we have to travel for weeks at a time with my job   plus  I am the youngest  I was out on the road just short of a month after starting  and honestly  little training  I really only started and am in transitioning to "being more comfortable"  my anxiety literally keeps me on edge 24 7   and truly learning all the information after traveling and talking to people  I'm really not happy with where I am at  and I'm only here because I receive full tuition remission if I go back for my Master's  which I am planning on doing and feeling rushed to start   If you're allowed to get up and walk around or take a small break outside  that helps me since I'm at a desk all day  staring at the computer  Give yourself the 5 minutes you need to recollect your thoughts and breathe  you more than deserve it    
I didn't feel anxious that night  but the difference was that that was he most of ever eaten   that  is what makes me question the Ligitimacy 
I appreciate your post and I thank you for sharing such  I'm glad you were able to feel better  even if momentarily 
If I had this advice when I was young   I wouldn't feel this depression I have  I would be racing away to escape this broken lie of a society and live my life as full as it can be     With all its sham  drudgery  and broken dreams  it is still a beautiful world   It is a beautiful world and I can't deny this beautiful piece of literature made me remember why it can be beautiful  That said  I pity the children human society molds and breaks them into something they'd rather not be  
Of course they will say that  they are trying to watch out for themselves 
I have tried my friend   been off of them for a month now but no luck 
Maybe you could thank  and possibly apologize to  your friends for helping you out at the time it was happening  I'm sure they will respond with something like "hey  that's what friends are for " because for non emets  it is no big deal  I understand how you are feeling embarrassed about the situation  so I think that by apologizing  and or thanking your friends for being there to help you out  it might make you feel better 
Me too 
Why will no one give them to you  
I got one of these for Christmas as well  They're really therapeutic for me and help reduce my anxiety  Not sure why  but it helps  
It's always been one of my favourites  I watched it again recently for the first time in a while and cried like a baby  It's a really beautiful story  Sorry that your friend never took the hint though   
That's a bummer  It's hard not to get attached 
Thank you  That is really helpful  I DO get hung up on the destination  And I DO get hung up in negative thinking  Mostly I think everyone is better than me  Especially all women  I need to recognize these as toxic thoughts that are not true  I really appreciate your support     
Your school may have a person you can speak to there   I have been there  i left half way through year 11  goes to year 12 before uni here in aus   Anyway  go see a psychologist or psychiatrist if you can  tell your parents how you really feel  it is hard but it may assist if they don't want to take you for whatever reason   I regret dropping out  but it was the best thing for me at the time   Seriously  talk to somebody at school if they have a somebody there for students  But honestly it would be best to see somebody outside of school   I am sorry you are stuck in this shitty cycle and as much as i can say it will get better  I understand that it is today that sucks  Speak to your mum and dad  not about leaving  but about seeing somebody to help you through this that is objective not subjective   Your mum and dad are subjective because of your relationship with them  Be open and honest  if you really need to then mention you are contemplating taking your own life if that is what it takes for them to take you seriously   I will check in in 9 10 hours to see how you're going if that's cool with you    
I lost my father the day after his anniversary last year  7 months ago now   edit  to cancer  so it was not entirely unexpected   I know it feels terrible  like you're drowning and you can't seem to figure out what you can do to catch a breath  and that's okay  It's natural to be overwhelmed right now  and if you could somehow stop feeling that way  you're just kicking the can down the road    You may have lost your mother  but you've still got a father and sister who love you very much  You're all going to need each other in the coming months  and as hard as it can be sometimes due to how we process grief  remember to try your best not to push them away  Be open and honest about how you are feeling and encourage them to do the same    I subscribed to this sub a long time ago when things were much worse for me  and I mostly avoid posting because I've gotten better over the years  which I mention now because it's important to realize the effect that surrounding yourself with other crushingly depressed people can have on you  Seek out positive elements and do your best to make them a part of your life  now more than ever  Try to smile on a daily basis   even if everything seems wrong  there's always something to look forward to  so set your sights on that  pick yourself up  and keep moving  If you remain static you run the risk of becoming paralyzed by your grief and your fears    Finally  a bit about grieving that I am going to shamelessly steal from another  much older and wiser  redditor     u GSnow   Alright  here goes  I'm old  What that means is that I've survived  so far  and a lot of people I've known and loved did not  I've lost friends  best friends  acquaintances  co workers  grandparents  mom  relatives  teachers  mentors  students  neighbors  and a host of other folks  I have no children  and I can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child  But here's my two cents    I wish I could say you get used to people dying  I never did  I don't want to  It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies  no matter the circumstances  But I don't want it to "not matter"  I don't want it to be something that just passes  My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person  And if the scar is deep  so was the love  So be it  Scars are a testament to life  Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut  or even gouged  and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love  And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was  Scars are a testament to life  Scars are only ugly to people who can't see    As for grief  you'll find it comes in waves  When the ship is first wrecked  you're drowning  with wreckage all around you  Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was  and is no more  And all you can do is float  You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while  Maybe it's some physical thing  Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph  Maybe it's a person who is also floating  For a while  all you can do is float  Stay alive    In the beginning  the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy  They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath  All you can do is hang on and float  After a while  maybe weeks  maybe months  you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall  but they come further apart  When they come  they still crash all over you and wipe you out  But in between  you can breathe  you can function  You never know what's going to trigger the grief  It might be a song  a picture  a street intersection  the smell of a cup of coffee  It can be just about anything   and the wave comes crashing  But in between waves  there is life     Somewhere down the line  and it's different for everybody  you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall  Or 50 feet tall  And while they still come  they come further apart  You can see them coming  An anniversary  a birthday  or Christmas  or landing at O'Hare  You can see it coming  for the most part  and prepare yourself  And when it washes over you  you know that somehow you will  again  come out the other side  Soaking wet  sputtering  still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage  but you'll come out     Take it from an old guy  The waves never stop coming  and somehow you don't really want them to  But you learn that you'll survive them  And other waves will come  And you'll survive them too  If you're lucky  you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves  And lots of shipwrecks     
I went to therapy  I'm on Paxil  25mg every night at bedtime  and just trying to focus more on myself rather than others  Yes  I still have my bad days  but I still work hard to make sure I don't let it get the best of me  
I mean if it makes you feel better  There are a few class action lawsuits against a few of the big brands  Fitbit is the biggest I think with one going  It could be settled by now  But it seems as tho the ones on your wrist are pretty inaccurate  Especially when you are doing something   And they aren't doctor "making any medical decisions     
Thank you for this reminder and congratulations   It's so important to remember to take it day by day  and not to be too hard on ourselves  All progress is good progress    
I seriously just panicked that I'm a day late returning to work   
Made me euphorically manic and had me discussing sheep with anyone who would listen for some reason    but it didn't trigger it for long  only smoked the one night   Effects may depend on strain and dose and susceptibility so use with caution  
That is absolutely legitimate  He took advantage of the fact that you were a young kid  who was not neurotypical  He took advantage of your kindness to sexually abuse you  It doesn't have to haunt you every day to be real  You don't have to be a perfect saint for it to be real  In your mind as a kid  it sounds like you picked up on a sense from the grownups that coercion alone wouldn't be taken as seriously as it  really was   and you wanted to make sure that they understood that what happened was wrong  It's sad that even after going through sexual assault  we often have to worry about people not believing us    And you did what you had to in order to make sure they'd listen  with the tools you had as a kid    Any consequences that came down on him  or harm that came to his family  are because of  his  actions  He committed a very serious crime  All you did was tell the appropriate authorities about it  That's on him  not you    Your experience is legitimate  And you shouldn't have to feel guilty about it  You did your best  and  you  didn't hurt anyone  
Starting off anything you're going to be the worst at it  You're the one with the least experience of course    I was an absolute shitty athlete  but if you work hard you don't have t be good for people t respect you  I was terrifible  The worst player in the league  and my team still encouraged me to get better and I was an all around liked guy    Don't give up  you'll get better

It is not your fault  What they did is criminal  Love and best wishes your way  3  3  3 
This is the same way my and my girlfriend are 
Thanks    though the  17bpm blip was a Polar chest strap and I wasn't moving  just sitting there  I hadn't wet the electrodes in a while as they ask you to do     but all the other readings near that moment seemed accurate  
Sounds like you are dealing with a lot   is the person who gave you the diagnosis someone you can get counselling from    Are you still in school   Make sure you see if your school has a disability services department because you might be able to get some extra time to do your assignments   The 2 strategies that I used when I felt really bad is Cognitive Behaviour Therapy and forcing myself to try to do occasional volunteer work without too much pressure   Maybe there is something you can do a couple of hours a week    It will help you see what your other interests are and get you connected with your local community   
You can do it   hugs 
You did a really good thing  I hope you're okay 
I am glad that stuff like this is getting more acceptable to buy and do  I used to work in a daycare and it would give me huge anxiety  On days where it was particular bad I would crank out there or coloring books and it would give the kids something to do and would get me calm too  Michaels sometimes has those too btw  
chgorocks2  You've posted really negatively a few times here  so others please keep that in mind  Dont take it to heart too much  You cant say "Normal folks in relationships with ocd partner RUN as FAST as you can " it totally depends on the situation  what the OCD partner is doing to fix it  and I guess the type of OCD  Dont fuel the OCD thats for sure  dont help with rituals etc  ERP  Exposure Response Prevention  is a great proven tool  but treatment aside  your comments chgorocks2 are to your personal experience  dont make people lose hope for no reason  OCD can be treated to 'virtually cured' and people can live life again  Relationships dont have to end  but if they do  its down to the couple to know based on the situation  Some random person on the internet has no say in that 
And that fantastic  fuzzy feeling you get when they eventually die  from an accident or age 
Came here to say this  Also you might have to to try a couple different medications before you find the right one  so if you're not getting better  having side effects  etc  tell your doctor   Congrats     
"Too many have had bad side effects"  So I can't get anything anymore 
The burden of depression is hard to carry  especially when everybody wants you to pretend you're fine when you're not   I hope you can shed this burden or at least lighten the load you carry by yourself each day   There is no shame in reaching out if you ever need to  I hope your depression is gone or at least eases this year   Remember life has highs and lows  depression mutes the highs and amplifies the lows  but you are important and loved 
I had the same issue at 22 and went thru a ton of test  Ended up I didn't have an ulcer and it was just from stress causing issues to my stomach  Turns out increase production in stomach acid is one of the first things your body does under stress    Have you had a scope done to your upper gi  It would tell you if you had stomach cancer or even an ulcer  Also a gi doctor talk would help if you have been having issues  More then a regular doctor    You literally sound like 22 year old me  I was in my last semester of college when it all started  Probably from all the stress going into the real world was bringing   I had to keep a food journal of what caused my biggest problems stomach wise  and just cut them out of my diet  I still eat fairly crappy  But I always make sure to do something probiotic and get in enough healthy stuff to balance it out  Once I started eating better and eating yogurt daily  I haven't had any chronic shits  but I do occasionally get stomach discomfort  I'm used to it by now  It's nothing serious  Usually just a build up of gas that I panic over and make worse  
It helps me to deconstruct them  and identify what the underlying fear is    For instance  I have dreams that sound pretty mild and normal  but I feel very upset over  In the most recent one  I had a guest in my home for the first time and he criticized my decor  It might sound silly  but I woke up  unreasonably  upset  So I dug into that feeling until I identified that the main "button" getting pushed was shame  So from there  I could reassure myself not about the dream  but about what's really on my mind    I've given up on trying to control dreams  But you can control how you respond  You live a good life  and you're a responsible pet owner  and your little ones are okay  And you'll be okay too  
I vividly remember the morning in 1997 when  after 4 weeks on an SSRI  I woke up feeling     not euphoric  but     normal  fine  okay  No feelings of dread or despair  or wishing I could just sleep forever  There was morning sunlight coming into the room  and I lay there for a bit thinking how nice that was  and realizing that it had been months and months since I had been able to notice how nice the morning sunshine is  I've had recurrences since then  and I've had to adjust my medications numerous times due to side effects or a specific med becoming ineffective for me after a few years  But I've had good psychiatrists who 1   Listened to me and took me seriously whenever I felt there was a problem with my medications  2   Were knowledgeable about a wide range of medication options  and 3   Were flexible and creative with adjusting doses or combining different medications  I talk to a lot of people who went to a general practitioner  or a second rate psychiatrist  who prescribed the latest "breakthrough" drug  or some old standby medication they always prescribed  and then when the results weren't good  the doctor would basically blame the patient  So these people went on suffering terribly with depression under the mistaken belief that "antidepressants don't work for me " Ooh  I could just throttle the quacks who treat their patients that way  if any practitioner tells you you're out of options with medications  or that the side effects you are experiencing are "not typical for this medication"  i e "you are imagining things"   find another doctor  You can feel better  Non chemical strategies such as cognitive behavioral therapy are important  too  and can be very very helpful  but in my experience I couldn't use those tools effectively until my underlying biologically based depression was under control  I wish you luck  Do not give up    You are going to have a good  fulfilling life   
Exact same experience with Ativan  I would randomly fall into fits of anger and scream at my wife over little things    It was a tough time 
Take a shower  wash off the day  Drink a glass of water  Make the room dark  Lie down and close your eyes   Notice the silence  Notice your heart  Still beating  Still fighting  You made it  after all  You made it  another day  And you can make it one more  You're doing just fine   Hugs 
Yes  sadly everything is actually a symptom of everything  Because by this point there is enough cases that enough people have claimed they have had every symptom wth every single disease  All it takes is one google search to mentally crippled someone    
ive gone from 50mg to 100mg in bad times recently  and i find myself suicidal every morning   its been about 3 weeks   should i keep going 
My PTSD nightmares seem to come and go in waves  I have noticed they're much less common and less severe when I sleep a little bit cold  no heating blanket  maybe one less blanket on me then I'd like  and when I don't eat anything for 3 5 hours before bed  I also like to sip herbal tea before bed  the ingredients don't do anything but I find it calming  I also have a very non stressful tv show or podcast ready on my phone to watch if I wake up from a nightmare  since it quickly diverts my attention away from the nightmare and back to reality 
You should buy a pet that will keep you company and love you    and also finding a girlfriend over time  D good luck hope all works out for you  3
I second what  u leap2 has already said  I used to have extreme panic attacks very often and it has been going for a while  but therapy really helped  Note that therapy doesn't always mean "go take a bunch of pills"  there are many kind of therapies and a lot of them what you could call "talk therapy"    I underwent Cognitive Behaviour therapy and it helped to reduce the intensity and frequency of panic attacks  It also teaches you how to help yourself without the need for distracting yourself  with video games for example   I'm just throwing this one in as an example of non pill taking therapy  I know there are many more but I have no experience with them    So the best thing to do would be to consult with your doctor and take it from there 
There is an important distinction that needs to be made here    'Ideas of reference must be distinguished from delusions of reference  which may be similar in content but are held with greater conviction'  13  With the former  but not the latter  the person holding them may have 'the feeling that strangers are talking about him her  but if challenged  acknowledges that the people may be talking about something else'  14  https   en m wikipedia org wiki Ideas of reference and delusions of reference  A delusion is fixed and false and cannot be reasoned through despite evidence to the contrary    I assure you not everyone hates you   and I bet you can find some examples for yourself to counter this  idea  and  feeling   It is a cognitive distortion that can be reasoned through  If you  believe  everyone hates you  you may provide elaborations for your delusion like you are damned or a mastermind villain    I think the gray area or spectrum for this may be if there is a great delay in your ability to reality test  
Hey  I understand why you feel like blaming yourself   Sometimes it can even feel a little easier to take responsibility for someone else's bad actions  because it means we could have controlled the outcome    However   this was not your fault   You did nothing wrong   The consequence of drinking too much is a hangover and a dry mouth  not sexual assault   This person is a predator   He fed you alcohol and he himself wasn't drunk  or not enough to impair his ability to take video and force you to do sexual acts   He is fully at fault here  not you   If you can talk to someone who is kind and understanding about this  it might be helpful   It's a lot to carry with you  this kind of experience   You shouldn't have to struggle with it alone 
 We start wiping stuff out and we begin to lose ourselves    Which makes memory loss during depression even more fun 
As a teenager I had panic attacks  Eventually I found myself on Paxil and later Zoloft which essentially fixed it  The panic attacks became rare and predictable  In college I went off all meds  I am now 29 and they have manifested in a new way  I get extremely anxious anywhere that I cant get to a bathroom or perceive it as inappropriate to suddenly leave and go  For example a 10 minute meeting at work is hell to me as soon as I realize I am trapped in that room  My stomach will turn and a panic will set in  Car rides are a nightmare  I am 29 and this started slowly this summer but has escalated now and has begun to take over my life  Christmas parties were hardly enjoyable  I went as far as to get a colonoscopy and am on some stomach meds now but it has become apparent that the mental end is the bigger problem since the gastro didnt find any wrong  I never wanted to go back on anxiety meds but I just scheduled an appointment with the doctor  I will probably look into CBT this time around as well  Heres to hoping this roller coaster if over soon 
Nothing I do these days makes me feel any better  I go outside  listen to music for a bit  I feel momentarily alive  Then I come back inside  and I start dissociating again  I think "Oh  if I watch a movie I like  it would motivate me to get going again " Nope  Maybe I feel kind of good for the hour and a half of movie runtime  but then I crash into the ground again  I'm "out of it" practically 24 7  I don't even feel like myself anymore  if that makes sense  I don't even have energy left to contemplate suicide  which I did until fairly recently  I feel like I'm hurtling towards  something  awful  but I don't even know what that is 
Hey thank you  that made me feel better 
I know you have already tried many things  and therapy  But here are my 2 cents  Try this book  Overcoming OCD by David Veale  Its fantastic  It is the core book used by therapists who are leaders in the field  So if you cant afford the fancy OCD programs  try this book  They literally use it in their own treatment programs   https   www amazon ca Overcoming Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Behavioral dp 046501108X ref sr 1 1 ie UTF8 qid 1483455743 sr 8 1 keywords Overcoming Obsessive Compulsive Disorder  Different methods work for different people  but I find a good combo is using SSRI meds to bring the anxiety OCD down to manageable levels and then using CBT such as Exposure Response Prevention to then treat the OCD  and then keep going and slowly reduce the medication  to the point where you no longer need the meds  and the CBT is what is keeping the OCD at bay  Using this approach I have seen OCD virtually disappear but you need to keep a wary eye to the signs and symptoms and fight it quickly if it ever creeps back 
What have you done for your social life there by now   The most straightforward thing would be for you to jump in the cold water and try to talk to people until you find someone you get along with  but I suppose you already did this
Ask your teacher if she could place you somewhere else  this always worked for me    And if this won't work  I would still talk with someone about it  Either your parents  a trustworthy teacher or someone you trust  Maybe they can give you advice
I always struggle big time this time of year   Nice to know I'm not alone  
I'm starting to think that CBT is not working for me as it should  as you have mentioned  It has helped some  but the constant negative thinking and terrible flashbacks still get to me  Maybe I'm just not trying hard enough or maybe I just need to see a psychiatrist and get put on medication 
Yes this is the typical approach  DBT is a special form of CBT  
Hey  what you're feeling is totally understandable   You have every right to be angry with this person   He was a predator  a criminal and an abuser     It's a human reaction to feel pity for someone who dies   But that doesn't erase their other behavior   This man was a complex person  so it's possible to feel bad for his death  but absolutely hate his behavior prior to death     I think it would be a lot to expect you to just deal with this type of situation alone   It's complicated and difficult   Do you have any kind of support network  where you can talk to someone about how you feel 
Hang in  there  Take the pills  Do the therapy  Focus on what makes you feel things  And do your best to not forget that you are wanted and needed  no matter how your brain tries to tell you otherwise  I encourage you to tell a friend  but only if and when you're comfortable  You're putting in the work  and that's commendable on its own  Keep it up   
This is actually super helpful  For whatever reason that last line really reassured me  Thank you very much 
Sorry for such a long reply  The short version is  if by any chance Sertaline doesn't work  don't give up and find a good psychiatrist who won't give up on you  either  Life  Is  Good 
They told you those things to try to silence you and excuse their behavior   They know what they did was evil     You did NOTHING wrong   They went after you and hurt you  they are criminals and they deserve to be locked up   Is there anyone you can talk to about this who could help you to get some care   You might need to go to the doctor 
So yesterday I felt a little gross still in my tummy  but was able to self soothe  I felt afraid to eat because I was afraid of the aftermath  That alone keyed me in that I was afraid of my IBS  and that I know that  and it's ok  Today I'm still a little yucky  Granted I still have a stuffy nose and cough  Sometimes the longer something persists  the more worn I feel against it  This phobia is so mean  
Dude  everything in this comment    Part of the problem with Trump  and part of the problem I have in even trying to understand the most basic elements of what the next 4 years are going to look like  is that I have no idea what he really believes  because his stated policies change from moment to moment  "Build that wall" becomes  "well  a fence" becomes "well  a wall    in some places " A week before the third debate  he had  no  position on abortion  then the night of  suddenly he's mister ain't life of the unborn the best  It's like pure chemical flip flopping injected right into the eyeball    But as a consequence  I feel like it's safer to take him at his word on everything  even when that everything conflicts with itself  However  I recently read an article about a family in a rural area near where I live who are scared about losing their healthcare despite having voted for Trump because  "We assumed he didn't mean it " WHAT THE EVER LOVING FUCK     The husband is on dialysis and a waitlist for a liver transplant  and you thought this was a good time to roll the dice on whether or not the "Obama care is a disaster" guy means it  I know you're stupid out of desperation  but jesus christ are you stupid 
Sorry to hear this  Sadly there just doesn't seem to be anything promised in this life so it seems we're all picked off pretty inconclusively  I think in some sense  at least he's not hurting anymore so that's good  It's a cold world and we're all huddling towards any trace of warmth we can find   I hope you find some warmth xx
I guess we are similar  Personally  I just tried my hardest to talk to people  Phases in where my depression was weaker than usual were very useful to me  It was extremly troubling  but I managed to get into discussions and being part of a normal chat can build up a lot confidence  So from there onwards  my anxiety got smaller and smaller and I think I can defeat it  
Hell I'm 23  never had a boyfriend and I know that I will end up being a crazy cat lady  For some reason the thought of getting old and living with cats alone isn't so bad to me 
Yes  but I wouldn't worry for this occasional and yes  legitimate use of sick time    I haven't been to work since before Xmas due to an episode that landed me IP  Will not be going back until PHP is done  Work doesn't have the details and as a temp employee there is no way for me to interact with their HR    scared  
yes  I've had way too many to count 
How do you mean confirmed    And yeah  a lot of people in my friend's list are black and Latinx  and I'm pretty worried for them after Jan 20    What are your thoughts on all the think pieces saying that left leaning people need to layoff the identity and racial politics 
The last time I was s  I was drunk  And I was also very calm because I had no idea it was happening  To this day  it's the only time that I feel ease around because 1  My body literally saved me  It was also one and done and I felt worlds better after  2  You can absolutely control this so it doesn't happen in the future  Water  water  water  eat  know your limits  I understand the obsession  But this is one time you absolutely NEEDED to get it out  
I smoke weed very casually  I was told by a psychiatrist once that it could have a similar effect on my mood as alcohol if I used it extensively  I trusted her  She was an exceptional physician  and this wasn't in a part of the world where marijuana was really stigmatized  I have heard it can worse mania    Generally  though  I think the research about bipolar disorder and pot is pretty inconclusive at this point though   There ARE long term consequences of smoking marijuana  though  They are well documented  and don't forget about them    My general opinion is that pot is great for anxiety and mild depression  It is probably better for your body than an antidepressant  and CERTAINLY better for your body than taking benzodiazepines regularly  
Why did your parents think that your franchise idea was mania  Mania is normally marked by other things rather than just grandiose ideas  If nobody ever had grandiose ideas we'd never get anywhere   Edit  also lithium isn't most doctors' first choice when it comes to a mood stabilizer  Usually they'll try you on something milder like Lamictal  I've been on plenty of meds but never lithium  My doctor just does not want to put me on it  and I understand why   IF you are bipolar  trust me  the right combo of meds is the best thing compared to living in your "normal state"   Having ADHD also has a tendency to be comorbid with bipolar  
Don't give up please  You might just meet somebody someday who understands you  You can take comfort in pets if you like  but just don't rule out that there is somebody out there please  
Just want to chime in to add another voice to the conversation   I'm going through something similar and slowly learning to trust that my doctor knows best  And there are a lot more who know how you feel  Hang in there  and like lostinedental said  just breathe  
Be careful  it won't make you happy
I can feel the same sometimes  Im 22 and ive never had sex nor have I ever kissed a girl  I went on one date before and its the only thing on my love life's resume    But the key is to not dwell on your lack of experience because the truth is at this age every single girl is going to be way more experienced than you so its not even worth worrying about  If you dwell on it you are completely screwed  
  I've been told Hillary actually won the popular vote too  a la Gore   Yeah  by something like 3 million votes  On one hand it's comforting  of the people who voted  they slightly prefer her to him  which seems slightly more rational  On the other hand  it's depressing because the Republicans have spent the last 8 years rigging the fucking game behind the scenes so that the voting districts would land in their favor  and it paid off "bigly "   I was barely around for Reagan  My first conscious memories of a president are Bush sr  But Reagan's administration was pretty fucked up  and yet you can't get near the presidency without singing a hymn to the great and powerful RWR  Even Hillary had to say how fantastic he was when almost everything awful about our current situation can be traced back to policies he enacted    I was going to vote for Bernie in the primary  I lived in CO at the time  which he won  so ultimately it didn't really matter   but discovered at the last moment that I didn't change my party affiliation from Republican from waaaaay back when I first got my license  I voted for Bush in 2004 as my first election  At the time  as a dumbshit 20 year old   I thought I had the world figured out and it seemed so obvious and easy  I feel like getting people to see their own ignorance is sort of the key to getting them to vote smarter  Like  an honest admission of knowing that we don't know a lot would go so much farther than being very confident in the small bit we do know  But I think conservativism creates a double bind in that regard  many of their values don't stem from knowledge itself  In fact  the act of conservation is  in many ways  a push against new knowledge because you're trying to preserve an old way of being  and old ways of being often fly in the face of new knowledge  But then they start to revere simpler modes of being expressly because they're simpler and not because they're factually better  
Can you please tell an adult so they can report this to the police  This is not your fault  Those guys deserve to be punished 
I have considered it    Especially since I hold out hope she will change her mind    Since she just went 180    Maybe she figures out everything I did was for her    This hope however is destructive    It has almost completely shut me down   However   I plan to add to this post for more details   It might sound sad  but I pray maybe someone reads it that can maybe help     Sadly  I didn't post a lot of the craziness     
I can be your someone to talk to
Hey there   I'm sorry you're going through this   Are you still in a control situation with your parents   I ask because I was severely abused by controlling parents  and I could not heal very well until I was away from them   For me it took a huge student loan and three part time jobs  but it was worth it to get out from their home and their toxic behavior   It was incredibly difficult for me to even think straight when every time I walked in the door I was barraged with abusive comments   If you are out from your parents home  then I think you might start by putting less pressure on yourself   It sounds like you're pushing yourself to figure out who you're attracted to and to move on those feelings  but if you feel confused  then acting on attraction may just be hurtful to you     It is okay to feel angry and hateful sometimes   During my severe depression times I would feel like I just wanted to destroy my body completely  Sometimes I felt suicidal and sometimes I just felt this global anger at my entire being   A lot of that was anger at other people  at my abusers  that I was redirecting inward   The important thing is  don't judge yourself for those feelings   They're only emotions  they aren't "wrong" or "bad"   it's just a way to feel   If you are able  feel them and let them pass     And if you can  be kind to yourself   Start with small self care  and build up from that   If you can do small things   go to bed on time  take your medications  if you have them  as I do  at the same time each day and be proud of yourself for that  wear comfortable clothing that you actually like  do some meditation if you are able   Once you get a good habit track going  you can fall back on it during really bad times   I'd be happy to talk more about this with you but I don't want to overwhelm you right off the bat 
Dude that is freaking awesome  good job  Keep going  you got this   Remember   You are smarter than what they tell you  Stronger than you think you are  and Braver than you believe   Have a nice day 
You have to dig deep and try to figure out if this just isn't the right thing for you  or if you're wimping out of something that could be really good for you  Forcing yourself to do something that you dread won't lead to anything good  but avoiding something simply because it's uncomfortable isn't good either  I just saw some quote in the past few days along the lines of "the comfort zone is a safe place where nothing ever grows"    Being humble and vulnerable enough to admit when you're bad at something is really freeing  You could choose to have a good humor about it  tell the class leaders how inept and silly you feel  compliment the other students who are better than you and learn from them  Maybe you could approach one of the leaders separately after a class and tell them how you're feeling  maybe they'll have an idea whether they think you'd be better off sticking with it or not    If it's not where you belong  that's fine  but try to replace it with some other pursuit then  Maybe just working out in general where it's not a group activity   Nobody in my family was ever athletic or helped me understand how to be so I know that's frustrating  I did come to find my own love for weight lifting  although I've ignored my own health for a few years now    Giving up is only self sabotage if you're giving up too easily  Nobody wants to have a class scheduled that they dread thinking about for the entire week  If you don't want to be there  don't do it  But just challenge yourself by asking if you're giving up for the wrong reasons  
1  It doesn't mean that  You definitely will see literature saying antidepressants are not useful for bipolar disorder  This is because research is not definitive yet  Lots of people with bipolar II disorder  probably bipolar I as well  take an antidepressant  Very common  They don't work for everyone  But having efficacy on an SSRI doesn't rule out bipolar II   2  My reaction is usually "you'd know " I have bipolar II  I wouldn't sleep for days  like 3 hours across a week  and would feel euphoric  talk so fast I'd choke on my words  Afterwards I'd be like    yeah not normal  Even though hypomania isn't full blown mania and you can function  you're still abnormally up up up  With that said  I didn't know at first and was only diagnosed when I was 23 after being treated for depression since I was 19  Things just kind of kept getting worse  Just talk to your doctor about highs you have and see what they say   3  Mild is a weird word because different drugs effect different people  But yes there are treatments that require less of a "commitment" than lithium  i e no blood work or being careful with liquid intake    4  Something that we cannot tell you  but I have heard it is normal for your body to have mood swings a bit until it readjusts to not having the antidepressant  Generally  though  you shouldn't have just stopped without a doctor   5  Not sure 
No it might not get worse  if it does or does not  you or me wont know  only those in the relationship  seriously what are you trying to achieve  You can give advice  but you should not say things like this with 100  certainty  You dont know the situation  And OCD does not have to take control  It just takes the right approach  I'm sorry if you had a bad experience or heard about a bad one  but it doesnt have to be bad for everyone  I would however say that regarding the post about the person getting help putting clothes on etc  the person without the OCD should try not to join in doing rituals compulsions avoidances This in the long run could make it worse  Help them fight it another way  But actually  we should not really tell people what to do here  https   www reddit com r ROCD comments 5cwxmz stop posting personal advice   Read that link  I know its not for this sub reddit  but the notes are still important 
So far  yeah  I've been with them 3 weeks  and the average seems to be a little over  10 an hour   Probably nothing compared to yours  but I also live in an area that doesn't see a lot of tourism 
Yup  I told my nuclear family about my awful time in out of state college  how I got to the point of suicide  and how I barely recovered through the college counselors   It was really hard  but really good for me  Now that my parents know  they have drove me to the therapist  psychiatrist  and I can tell them how I'm feeling   However I only tell my dad some things as we got a lot closer after I told them everything  For example  at one point during my time back home  dropped out because suicide and they agreed  I practiced hanging myself in the garage  Fortunately I didn't go through and told my dad about it later  I don't want to tell my mom because she won't be able to handle it well  
good luck to you man  this world is more interesting with someone like you in it
You should contact your doctor immediately and talk to him her 
I would defiantly get someone with authority involved it sounds like they took advantage of you which is not ok 
Pretty cool  I have a couple good coloring books myself  I'm glad people are rediscovering simple pleasures like this 
No praabs    And in many instances  it's not necessarily Trump and his policies I fear  though they aren't exactly a prize either   but the fact that the KKK and various white supremacy organizations love him so much  His presidency gives them a degree of validation they haven't had in a long time  and that's what the documented outbreak of violence testifies to  the super duper racists feel like it's their time to shine  All the planned protests on the 20th are going to get fucking bonkers   This isn't to say all Trump supporters are crazy racists  I think at the most 20  are  but that 20  is pretty spooky  This guy  for example  http   www cnn com videos us 2016 12 07 richard spencer texas am ganim dnt ctn cnn There's a longer piece about him from The Atlantic that's worth reading too 
Well done  I don't know you  but I'm proud of you for seeking help  Remember that that help is there even when you're at your worst 
What more can you ask for  That's great progress 
This is not your fault at all  Please tell an adult so they can notify authorities  I am so sorry this happened to you 
Would appreciate it if you could put some context to this  what do they usually expect from you  Also Is it your perception of how all people treat you or is it certain individuals and their particular personality traits that make you feel uncomfortable 
I just got one of these yesterday and I totally agree  
Thanks  I appreciate it   Your words mean a lot   I'll try my best to keep writing and persevering   A vent is a vent  it shouldn't matter if it's good  so long as I can get things off my chest 
I got on sertraline about 10 days ago   I was on 25 mg the first week and then up to 50 mg since then   I would talk to someone that you trust  if you can   Other people can sometimes notice symptoms that you cannot   I definitely have noticed side effects and effects  but they changed from day to day at first  but now things seem to be stabilizing   The side effect were generally mild and tolerable  one day  no sex drive  which is unusual for me  another day  light dizziness  another day  a nice feeling of calm  another day  heartburn  another day  diarrhea    Good luck  
First of all  congratulations on not 'freaking out' about your new diagnosis  I'm really proud of you too  That can be very scary on its own  and with anxiety it can be even worse    As far as being scared to sleep  I'm so sorry for what you're going through  We all know how important sleep is  and if you're anything like me your anxiety probably gets worse if you're not well rested  My biological father has sleep apnea  and while he doesn't suffer from high anxiety  it made him deeply afraid to sleep as well  The good thing is that they had solutions for him  he now sleeps with a mask that helps him breath during the night  even if his brain forgets  This actually has helped with his depression and with a heart condition he takes medication for    I'd encourage you to pursue a sleep study and talking to your doctor about possible solutions  I seems so much easier to not know and not deal with situations on this side of them    but imagine what it will feel like to have control over this situation and be working toward some solutions to help you be healthier  It's okay to be scared and feel like you're up against something scary and unknown  but you have me and r anxiety to help you along the way    Good luck with whatever you decide moving forward  and please PM me if you want to talk or need some extra support  
Yeah  I feel awful
When I'm feeling low  I buy computers and computer upgrades  In the last few weeks  I've bought a surface tablet  16 GB ram and an SSD hybrid drive for my desktop machine  and I just bought my dad a chrome OS machine 
Thanks  that means a lot   I really appreciate it 
You have depression so it's normal that you don't want to participate in these social activities  They  parents  school  society  might drag you by the collar  telling you this and that  and you might kick and scream in retaliation  your life may just be a constant fight because of this tragic condition that you  like me and so many others have to take shit for   But I think it may comfort you to know that regardless of what anybody may say  you're definitely NOT wrong or unjust  Stay safe and PM me if you wanna talk xx
Totally true  When I'm really keyed up  I feel paranoid  It helps to stop and think "OK  is there some specific reason I think something is going on  Probably not "
I am going through the exact same thing right now  except that I have to go to work tomorrow  I don't want to postpone it again  I feel like the more time passes the more afraid I become  I am not sure I can stay there for 8 hours and focus on my job  Last time I was there I started crying and wanted to go home  I don't know what to do   
Congrats    I hope they help you  I have depression and finally started taking meds for it last year  They helped immensely for me and I can live almost normally   whatever that is  Best wishes dear 
I'm so sorry this happened to you  Have you thought about getting tested for STD's  I would consider talking to somone about this and if you are comfortable maybe talking the police  It is obviously up to you and you have to do what you feel comfortable with  whatever decision you make it will be the right one  Maybe contacting someone from your local rape crisis is also a good idea  they will be able to point you in the right direction  I am always here if you want to talk 
What was the subject you liked 
my parents are quite controlling  asking where I am  where I got my pills from  psychiatrist   to gender identity issues  very controlling and repressive   I just feel completely messed up like I'm just externally alive to keep them happy  but inside I've been ripped apart completely and very hallow inside  I don't know how to proceed with relationships either  it's like if someone talks to me  female  I want to get real close with them and start a "relationship" but have no idea how they'd react if they later discover inside I feel different and all the mess I've been through   I'm going through  I feel so  so much pain in my upper inner thighs and groin 
Maybe you can bring something nice for yourself to eat or drink if the day starts to get bad or lonely  
Tbh with you I can't tell  I do dread it all week  I just don't know  I like how aggressive people are in there  It's the only place where I got that outlet and actually feel like a man  But yeah  idk    My gut is telling me that I would like it if I was brought up knowing how to be physical and all that stuff you described  
I have a lot of avoidance strategies  I try and get busy when I have intrusive thoughts  Go for a walk  clean my house  drink tea  moisturise  paint my nails  go online and read the news blogs  exercise if I can be bothered to  plan meals to cook  generally avoid letting my mind idle too much  I avoid showers during these times which probably isn't great    Or you can try to 'put it down'  By which I mean give physical form to whatever is going through your head and then you can put it down and walk away from it  I do this by writing in a journal  but especially writing poetry and painting is helpful for me  I was able to put down and walk away from a lot of distressing memories because of painting  I keep the paintings and can choose to look at them or not  But having them out of me is a relief    If your problem is persistent  I'd say you should seek professional support if you haven't already  Counselling may help  Best thing I did for myself is get back on anti depressants and anti anxiety medication     Wish you all the best  
Formatting doesn't fix a broken computer    Not always 
It's been a little over seven years  and the PTSD isn't as bad as it used to be  The depression and anxiety are manageable with medication and monthly therapy  Working out releases some good mood boosting hormones  I did yoga for a while  I journal sometimes  I play video games with online friends and that's a big part of my social life and makes me happy  And I acknowledge that it may never get 100  better  and that this may always be a burden I have to bear  Everyone has burdens  despite what their bright and peppy social media feeds may tell you  This one is mine  and I can be strong enough to carry it  as long as I do what is necessary  such as take my little white pill every morning  Things may not ever be the same as they used to  but I do believe they get better  
I'm sorry for your medical condition and for the fact no one has tried to help  But frankly I also understand your classmates school admin for their reaction  Sure a passing 'are you better' would have been nice  but this happened before the holidays  Half of them probably don't even remember what happened  Hell  I don't remember half of what happened the last day of school either    And I'm sure your teacher meant the best  They can only do so much  
Tackle this problem one issue at a time  You'll overwhelm yourself if you focus on all of these various things that are causing you anxiety and depression    There are two things that you can immediately work on with little to no risk of making your social anxiety worse  your parents being overbearing and trying to control your life and your porn addiction  You should confront your parents about them pressuring you to get a girlfriend and tell them that they need to realize it is only making things worse for you  You should also explain to them how you are feeling    they are your parents and will love you unconditionally even if they don't understand  I would   STRONGLY   recommend seeing a therapist to talk about these issues  That is something that has no negative side effects even if it doesn't work for you    For porn  I would at least recommend cutting it down  I know it's pretty hard to break an addiction  but if you can really put your mind to it and tell yourself why this addiction is bad you will be able to break it    So what if you're a virgin  I was a virgin until I was 25  It's not a big deal  Trust me  I hate seeing myself in the mirror to this very day  And I have a woman that wanted me  It will get better  you just have to take the necessary steps to start beating it  Therapy being the biggest one    Have you considered taking medicine for your depression anxiety  That would help in a big way with your university program and beating the social anxiety associated with that    Please feel free to PM me  i'd be glad to listen to you if you need to say anything else  
I rarely eat  food makes me feel sick  Unfortunately  I'll try with the drink though  thank you 
Everyone has told me to make something beautiful from my pain   Yes  my happiness is forever dulled  I agree with the other poster that there is no going back  But i also have learned to embrace the darkness  to use it as fuel to succeed at work and school  to create beautiful  tormented art    So much of my life is fucked because of my trauma  I have c ptsd because I've had multiple traumas  I have embarrassed myself over and over with my extreme insecurities and obsessive clingyness to those I deem worthy to trust  I have so many issues  my weight constantly goes up and down  switching between not eating and eating too much  I've had an eating disorder for a long time     My traumas have created so much pain in my life  I often feel like screaming and crying  wailing  Yet I walk around  numb to most of life  I'm so far away from fixing how they continue to effect me  But I have learned how to take that pain inside of me  and turn it into something good  Even talking to others  sharing your experience and stories  sharing your strength   is a way to fight the dulling    It doesn't bring you back to who you used to be  but it does counter the effects with something different and good   something that is you  something that makes you feel better about yourself  something you can always carry with you  
Can you go "LC"  limited communication  with your parents   If you are 18  they don't have ANY right to pry into your life   And they will continue to terrorize you as long as they are able to do that 
Art  it was actually really helpful for a while and I felt like I was working through some of my problems but now I just cant seem to even start painting drawing most of the time  
Hey  if you want to talk  you can always PM me
Yup 
Thank you so much 
I told my dad I needed to talk to him about 5 minutes ago  he said "About what  I need to go somewhere now " And my mom also went with him  and they will be here in only 3 hours  then they make up excuses like they are going to sleep already although they stay up for more 3 freaking hours or something   I don't really have anyone to talk to on school  I'm infamous there because of how bullied I am  people just dont want to talk to me   I don't know what to do anymore  if I really go to school tomorrow I'll just come back home after the first class and make up an excuse 
I see  Maybe you are missing the relationship with the teacher or your classmates   
I'll talk to you  I would much rather be helpful than sit here and continue wasting time 
Opposite for me  I spent most of my years partaking in social nonsense I now feel embarrassment for  I don't know why but my voice has this really grating aspect to it I can't personally stand and I feel like I used to whore it around pretty shamelessly under the false impression it carried significance  Well it doesn't get out as much as it used to and I'm okay with that for now at least 
I see  Yes  you could bring your favorite soft drink  if you have one   
10 49 right now  Went to bed at 11 and just woke up  It's strange how when the moment I wake up all my problems seem to vanish  Then 5 minutea later everything comes back 
This looks awesome  I'm pretty into the adult coloring books right now  so this would be a nice addition  There's something to be said for completing a project  no matter how simple  and being able to feel good about it  
I just really want to stay home  I hate school  all my friends are online  and I can barely see it due to our time zones and because of how much time school takes away from me 
Well there is that pineapple soda I drink all the time  my friends think I'm addicted  Probably am   It's often my only source of sugar haha
It's difficult  culturally  legally they can't pry into my life  but culturally they could pry into my life even if it was under physician patient privilege  I live overseas  don't really want to disclose location just in case my mother follows me here 
I think partially yes  With my class mates  I've never really understood how to make friends with people so I think they're really nice but dont know how to start talking to people out of class and making real friends  I think they think I'm too weird to be honest  Thank you for replying by the way  I really apreciate it  
I'm not quite on the same page but I think I can relate somewhat  Quite a while ago now I was dating my best friend  First girl I swear I was falling in love with  I felt I would actually like to spend the rest of my life with her   Unfortunately though  shit didn't work out  I was already depressed but losing her hurt me so much  Today I'm not looking for a girlfriend or love  Thats too much work  Really I still miss my ex and think of her time to time  Except it doesn't hurt me anymore   In terms of love  it was amazing but hurts at the same time  It hurts not being able to see that person  getting in fights  and when they feel sad  It's totally worth it   I think I still love her and would get back together if we crossed paths again  However  I'm not interested in anyone and not looking  It's too much work  I have too many problems  and it's just easier to go straight home 
I'm experiencing something similar   My partner is amazing and affirmative and understanding and compassionate beyond belief  I could go on about how good he is for me  But I still worry about all of those "what if"s  What if he doesn't really love me  What if I'm not good enough for him  What if he actually secretly hates me  Am I too clingy  Too distant  Did I say the wrong thing    When I end up in these negative thought spirals  I feel like my anxiety will devour me alive   How can anyone live like this   My therapist told me that when I end up in these spirals of self doubt convinced that he's going to leave me etc to just repeat "I'm worthy of love" over and over again for like a minute  and maybe take a Lorazapam  lol  
Exactly    been trying so hard to not Google my symptoms and to not look up illnesses  but sometimes I crack thinking I could handle it when I can't  I guess I have to keep trying  
Pineapple  That sounds nice    You could bring that 
It's really hard xx  Are your friends from online forums 
Hey  don't beat yourself over the head too much  This entire break this has been my sleeping pattern   Fall asleep at 3 4 AM Wake up at 6 7 because of conditioning Go back to sleep till 9 10  Force myself to go back to sleep to avoid reality Roll around in bed till 2 3 PM and finally get up 
Honestly that made me laugh because it sounds like dark humor  Whats your new years resolution    I want to die   D
You're welcome      Okay  I'm sorry you feel that way  It's nice to have friends    Maybe you are concerned that they will reject you   
I pull out Mind Over Mood and do a little  It's never enough that I feel great after  but the book makes it clear that it'll be a while before seeing real results and I feel good about taking my life into my own control and actively working to make myself better  A sense of accomplishment is decently effective and pulls out the hopelessness a little for me  It's also usually easy enough to do   Also going for a walk  even a short one  but I don't really do that as much in the winter  Real easy to do though 
No  they're friends I met on Steam   Gaming plataform 
I'm 23 and the same  Damn  seems like currently I'm the oldest relater to OP here  p
Omg yes   It's pretty much all I think about at all times and the reason I'm so suicidal   Glad I'm not alone
hello  i've had anxiety since i was a teenager  but i was just put on lexapro and xanax a couple years ago  i'm a law student  so i'm in a really high stress environment a lot of the time  but i'm learning to deal with my anxiety through medication and self care  
It does get better  I promise  so please keep fighting and don't give up and if you ever want to talk to someone I'm here for you  hugs

Yeh  I think so  I think I just assume everyone already has as soon as I meet them and they just dont want to be rude  Do you think it would be good to ask if they want to do something art related  I have anxiety issues so I find socalising makes me nervous  
I think the general rule is that most of the side effects fade off after the first month  and you just basically have to tough it out   Most of SSRIs don't even reach their peak benefit until after 8 12 weeks 
I will thanks   
I'm with you guys on that for sure  1 moment when you wake up you feel great then the next moment you're like  dang I need a couple cans of Pringles to crunch my problems away
This certainly wasn't your fault and don't ever think it was  Like all other comments  contact authorities  You aren't you when you're drunk  you're easy to be manipulated  that happens to all of us  but those boys took it way too far  All I can really beg of you is to not be embarrassed or feel like you're less of you because of this  Right now embarrassment shouldn't prevent the important issue at hand  So far it seems they did three things capable of getting them in trouble  they gave alcohol to a minor  they had sex with a minor  which is bad enough on its own  but they also seem to have done it without consent  and they proceeded to harass you afterwards  
The past six months i've had quite the crippling anxiety   panic attacks  I wish someone would have been thoughtful enough to try to give me some coping mechanisms such as this  as a gift  But I am thankful of course for getting any presents at all 
Good to hear that someone is going through the same thing as me  I just felt ok the past couple weeks and thought that I could go in  Are there any options for you like a modified schedule or working from home  I'm hoping to make it in at some point today  but me and my HR director talked about that in the event I wasn't able to start back up soon  My anxiety typically passes by mid morning so hopefully I can make it in around 11  
I've been on sertraline for 1 year and it has changed my life  Six weeks to the day after I started taking it  I woke up feeling like someone I hadn't been in 2 years  I no longer wanted to die  I almost cried when I realized I was myself again  Don't give up if it doesn't work right away  You might get physical energy back before emotional energy  try to be patient  I still have days where I want to crawl in hole and hide  but it's not an all consuming feeling anymore  it's easier to keep going  Taking things one day at a time became possible  I hope things work for you 
The series is called Connect Your Way to Calm   I have this one  https   www amazon com Dot Dot Cats Connect Your dp 031635841X  
There is absolutely hope for you   I have ptsd from sexual trauma and other abuse as a kid and a rape in my early twenties   I'm 27 now and feel like I'm living for the first time   I still have minor symptoms like nightmares or occasional triggers but overall I am more trusting of the world and people and live mostly "in the moment "  It takes a long time but definitely give therapy your all   That helped me so much   And journaling about the traumas   Also check out some books on trauma   Idk how well your English reading ability is but I loved cptsd by pete walker and the courage to heal  guide for survivors of childhood sexual abuse by Ellen bass and Laura Davis   Those are absolute gems   Maybe they'd have them translated in your native language   Definitely try those out   Lots of self care is important   Treat yourself with the love and respect and care you deserve 
I carry a lot of my stress in my head and I get headaches often myself  The headaches send me into panic attacks sometimes because I'm sure I'm having a stroke if they come on suddenly so I understand what you're going through  It sucks that it's so hard convincing yourself you're okay    at least now you know you're not alone   
I'm not sure where she got  mine  https   www amazon com Dot Dot Cats Connect Your dp 031635841X  but I saw some at Michael's craft hobby store 
As someone who just a few months ago had basically no future  now i have my license  my own truck  and a job helping the developmentally disabled  It can be done  good luck we all know you can do it 
I see that it makes you nervous  But I think it would be a good idea to ask them if they want to hang out or do something art related as you said  You could get together and draw and have tea  or go to a museum or something   Maybe you have thought about that already 
It's not easy  In this world it's clearly an important skill to be able to love ourselves because we can't depend on other people all the time  Everyone is just broken in their own way and it's broken people depending on broken people  Sometimes it helps me to be kinder to myself if I imagine a separate person  with all my problems and faults  and realize how quickly I would be kind to that person and tell them that they still have worth and value   The things I absolutely hate myself for  that I haven't been taking care of myself  I keep breaking promises to myself  etc  any other person that sat next to me and told me that  I'd so easily be able to tell them that they are still worth while and they just need to try again  Try to be friendly to yourself  
The job makes you suicidal   That blows

She's a minor  it doesn't matter if it's consensual as long as this happened in the U S  or any other place with an age of consent over 15  which is most places  
Yes  I agree  I've been going to movies alone for years too  since times that I was still in middle school  On some occasions I went with classmates  as I didn't have any friends outside school  or parents  but since I actually have been enjoying movies and the cinema experience more than people who surround me  there was no other option than to go alone  It kinda started bothering me at some point  ages 16   19  but never even once after that  Being the last one to leave the hall  Say "have a nice evening" to the staff  in the past used to be embarrased   Now in fact to me watching alone is also the best way to enjoy a movie  I get to concentrate on the movie  plot  music  cinematography  acting  lighting  visual effects    and after that I can remain in thoughts about the movie and so on   But not all is set to stone  there have been people with whom watching a movie in cinema has actually been also a fun experience  Mostly  however  I try to invite someone only when the movie I plan to see is something that i'm not sure about  either due to critics or trailer 
If she's in any place where the age of consent is over 15  which is pretty much almost every place on earth  it's rape  there's no excuse 
I too am having social anxiety  Recently someone send me this  article  http   waitbutwhy com 2014 06 taming mammoth let peoples opinions run life html  about understanding it    I am not sure if it's able to help me but I wanted to share it nevertheless 
I try to cry whenever possible  I also ude EMDR an eye movement tool that helps to balance the left and right brain  and filter stress in the memory center 
I have and I will give it a go  its just a big step for me to do something like that  
I'm 25  so not really 
Sounds like this happened at least two days ago  sounds like she would've cleaned up in that time unfortunately  though I'd be willing to bet that the site still has evidence  
Yeah  I try to sleep as long as I possibly can  only get out of bed when it physically hurts to be there any longer  Then I take two steps to my computer chair and spend the day here  
Shit   I argue with my subconscious a lot as well 
Assuming you live in the UK  because of A Levels etc   go to your GP and ask about seeing an occupational therapist   this has been the most helpful for me  CBT has helped but Occupational Therapy works by finding ways to do the things you want to do  They can meet you at your home and help you to go out  sort you out with an exposure therapy type treatment tailored for you  help with general life stuff like sleep schedules and mine has even sorted out going to art classes  I live in Scotland and I've also had help from "Befriending Services" which despite the patronising name is simply someone who comes to you and simply takes you out to help with any exposure work that you might need someone to accompany you  which sounds like it might help you since your family is unwilling to help  the one I used was called SAMH but unfortunately they are a Scotland only service       With all due respect to some of the other posters in the thread  going back to school or to a gym will almost definitely not be an easy "small" step for you  You aren't pathetic for not being able to go out without someone else  I've certainly been in that position and I know many of the other posters on r agoraphobia have been or are exactly where you are  some people call this being housebound  A good way to judge a small step to get better from agoraphobia is to choose something you think you can do  but that will raise your anxiety levels a bit  For me 3 years ago and in a very similar position to you this was simply sitting at the window looking out for 10 minutes  I repeated this until my anxiety reaction was much lower then increased the difficulty  longer period of exposure  then opening the window  standing by the door and so on  eventually each of these steps took me a few months later to being able to go to the shops alone  I'm still in the middle of recovery so there is an awful lot I can't do  but everything I have been able to do has been the result of tiny seemingly insignificant steps 
Yeah  when you've built a life with someone for 5 years and it all comes crashing down around you  you're willing to do a lot

if you're in school I guess you are 15 17  I'm quite confused that your parents don't intervene  Have you clearly stated that you tried to kill yourself  that an incredibly bold statement and it just seems odd that they ignore it  if it is the case  maybe you didn't get the point across  I'm hoping your parents care for you  and I guarantee they do   I struggle incredibly when talking to my parents about these topics  they hardly know anything  I say you should see a doctor as they are someone you can talk too   I'm hoping it's free in your area  and can at least give you guidance  If it's like the UK  you should be able to get counseling for free since you're a student   Anyway  what else are you going to do  you're not going to school so go to the doctors  just see someone  Remember that although you should go to school  if you sick then you should take a break  It does wonders  I'm certain  I still do the same now and again in college    Lastly  for the bullying  I'm not sure what to say  I was lucky and never had to deal with it  Just talk to your school  I'd recommend your nurse or tutor first or whichever teacher you like the most  ultimately  they are there for you no matter what  The bullying is just one more factor which is holding you back and it will not resolve itself    Remember that karma can be a bitch and I hope they get screwed over for bullying you   P   unfortunately  even if School wasn't compulsory  you still need it and you should keep going   Happy new years to you  It will be a rough start but I hope the best comes your way     
I totally get  it   I have cats too   One of my cats loves to spoon   He's the little spoon obviously     Almost always we lay on our left sides  he's on my arm with his head on the pillow just below my chin   Sometimes  he lays his head on my face   He fits perfectly and he likes to curl his back feet into my arm   I love it   Dealing with severe depression  I still sleep more than I should and having my cuddle buddy helps make things better   He's 16 years old and has lost his hearing   I'm going to be devastated when his time comes

I do this if it's over a prolonged period too  I'm happy to have people chat about whatever and just input when I can if they're really interested in what they're talking about  But if it goes on for too long I lose my socialisation motivation  if that makes sense  and I'll be pretty quiet for the rest of the night   I find people chatting about stuff in a small group I have no idea about increases my anxiety because I don't want to look dumb  naïve or uninteresting and that causes me to spend a lot more energy even though I'm saying nothing which wears me out quicker    I don't really have a solution for you sorry but you're not alone 
not that I argue it's more like theres someone else in my head  I talk to them often and even during daydreams or thoughts I refer to it as sub 
That's good  I think it is a good sign that you want to give it a go    Of course you'll have to expect that some people will turn down your offer  but I hope your former class mates will say yes    If you haven't been encouraged to find friends and to socialise by your parents it is a little more tricky to learn it on your own  but it  can  be done  
If you think you're going crazy  you're not  Crazy people don't know they're going crazy  Hang in there man  
Go for a walk  Fresh air always makes me feel better  Do you by chance play Pokemon go  Try to walk to a spot to get more pokeballs 
Yeah it's been a slow and brutal process of trial and error for the last six years however  So I've slowly been increasing my doses over that time frame to where I am now    It wasn't like I just suddenly jumped up to it in a span of a few months  
Friend I've been there before  There are other people  It may not feel like it now but I promise you there are  Life isn't worth ending over one person  
Not sure if you have ever tried to kill yourself before but if you try and fail well  the next day is no walk in the park  I have attemped multiple times about 7 or so times over the past 10 years  Well the next day is a very odd feeling all your seritonin is gone and if you thought like you felt like a zombie before this is a million times more zombified  Watch some motivational videos on you tube it helps me when i feel down i reccomend a video called why we fall 
Get your GED  
I see   that's great that you have these friends xx  I'm not much of a gamer but you seem like a cool kid   I'd be your friend

Sure you can  You don't have to be constantly down to be depressed  Even depressed people can have good moments or even days  For people with MDD  major depressive disorder   the pattern is they'll be in a relatively normal emotional state and go through depressive episodes which last 2 or more weeks  
Is she receiving professional help  therapy  meds      You sound like a very kind and supportive partner  but this is beyond you   It doesn't sound like you guilt her or pressure her so I don't see more you can do besides encourage her to get help   
I have pretty much been doing the same thing you have  I'm happy to talk to you if you can talk to me
I feel the same way  I lived in abusive households growing up  It haunts you in ways you don't expect  like a trigger for me is slamming doors  even sometimes just closing a door loudly will make me jump through the roof and send me into an anxiety attack 
May I call you Pat  You can call me Erico  if you want to   Pat  are you taking any medication  Also  are you going to a therapist  I've been facing depression for some years and sometimes even the videogames doesn't help  What is taking me away from the bottom are meds  constant visits to the therapist and a new set of behaviors and mindsets I want to adopt from now on   If you need to talk about strategies to cope with depression  you can PM me anytime 
it's all very first world problemy  which makes me feel worse for feeling like this      i'm an assistant to the head of a company in an industry i'm not passionate about  i'm constantly over my head even after a year and the pettiness and passive aggressiveness of my inexperienced boss just isn't worth it if there is nowhere for me to go in this company  the goal is to find something in the right industry because thats the whole reason i moved to this dang city in the first place  it's just a hard industry to break through    as for living   currently share a one bedroom with my roommate  she has the living room  and we've had a wealth of problems with our landlord  she's stuck up and self involved  bedroom door won't shut  had no power for a week  shower constantly leaks  no bathroom faucet for the first two months  just blatant neglect on her part  especially considering how much we're paying   the goal is to move into a cheaper part of town and find at least a two bedroom  but a three would be great cuz we could get a third person and pay even less  but since we're looking at the lowest tier of pricing and we're both girls who would very much like to avoid gang territory  almost went there last year   it's stressful    it's all just very daunting and when mixed with the existing depression and anxiety just sends me into a spiral    okay  vent over  will continue waiting in the dmv for some rando client of my boss now     
You are an amazing person and everything will be go alright I promise   hugs 
Sounds like a Tulpa  It's exactly what you're talking to  I tried forming a Tulpa but gave up quickly  but that's cool how you formed it naturally  They're not harmful  they just act like humans but instead are inside your head 
I'm around that age  I just don't like to tell exactly how old I am  well  my parents just tried to calm me down when I said I wanted to kill myself  and then after a big bullying problem I had with 3 guys I had to go to court or something like that  and when they asked why I wanted to kill myself  and before I could even end talking about one of the many reasons the "therapist" said  "That's not a reason to commit suicide" I got really angry but I couldnt do anything   Well  bullying  I remember this day  2nd June 2015  I was on my bike while going back home after school  I lost control of it and I fell  I had large cuts on both my elbows and knees  half of my face was red and burning  and I broke 2 teeth  instead of people being normal and fucking helping me they just laughed and walked away  I didn't go to school anymore until september that year  Im still really angry at those who laughed at me  and some times my class even makes jokes about that  which I don't take really well  I just wished it happend to them aswell  I had the wounds from the accident for a whole month  and I didnt go out during all that time because I didnt want people to think I was a monster  and that was during summer time     I really hate that I NEED TO STAY IN SCHOOL  but eh I cant do shit about it  Thanks  same for you 
Honestly I just force myself   I don't work but I am in school full time and have a family  three children    I try to rarely let my anxiety keep me at home or stop me from doing what I need to do  it does happen occasionally      The whole thing is to not overthink it  just get in the car and go   When you start to worry you won't make it  envision a stop sign and say the word STOP to yourself   Every single time a worry creeps up   Crank up the music and sing at the top of your lungs   Just get there   You can do this 
Therapy is good  if you can get some antidepressants try them  If you find yourself having serious suicidal thoughts  call an ambulance    Also  in order to have a healthy relationship  you will also need to have friends other than her in the long run  I'd try joining a club   finally finding real friends was what got me out of my depression almost two years ago   
What kind of job will you be doing  Project programming  tool programming  IT  bugfix  databases management        Depending on what your tasks are  your involvement with other people vary   I'm a software engineering student currently doing and internship in a big name company  I'm mostly doi g programming on the main project to further that peoject  and I also work a lot with another department of peogrammers specialized in datamining on the user's interacrions with our project  I implement stuff that sends data to their databases  I also do bugfixing like every other programmer in my department   My point is  I was scared shitless to do interviews  and when I entered the company for my first 2 weeks  I had no prior programming job experience  so this was pretty much like stepping on the unknown  And I adapted  It is scary at first  because you don't know anybody  you don't know what you're doing  you don't know if you're doing your job properly or if you are closing tasks fast enough  I know that for the first 2 months  I was scared that I wasn't doing a good enough job   My main contact throughout the first month was my internship supervisor  who was the lead for my team of programmers  I would report to him  I would get my tasks from him  and I would go to him for help  He introduced me to other people from various departments sometimes because they had the info I needed  He helped me fit in  He helped me know who to go to when I needed help from a specific department   After a month  I was pretty much ok with asking other people directly for help  I even started talking a lot more to the collegues that were sitting on the desks around me   After two months  I had and internship meeting with my school evaluator and my supervisor  And I learn that I was doing a great job  and that I adapted to and learned the project better than most interns they had in the past  However  he said that I was reluctant to go directly to other people for help and that I needed to broaden my circle of contacts   So overall  I wasn't doing so bad at all  I'm saying all this because I was in your shoes  Scared of interactions  scared of judgement from co workers  And overall  I discovered that its not that bad  Its harder at first simply because you don't know anyone and you have to learn the project  and you feel like you don't know what your doing or that you're not doing it good enough   Truth is  you're an intern  You're not expected to know everything  You're not expected to adapt as fast as someone who has been in the industry for years   As for relationship  everything will come in time  If you're scared of talking to other people and need help with your tasks  go to your supervisor or your lead  Talk to him  He'll guide you to whom you need to talk to  He's there to help you  He'll introduce you to the right people   Good luck  I hope you enjoy yourself 
Have you had counselling   
I know it seems silly  it's just that on top of my growing depression it just became too much to bear  I was starting to picture we would have a future and he basically just told me the next one has to be the one and I'm not it

Are you seeing a therapist  Are you able to see one  It seems like you're in a vicious cycle with these things  and the best thing to do might be to address the anxiety  If only we could consciously control our internal organs  eh 
And that's the joke isn't it      Depression is something only we can face on our own  I'd rather be told that then be comforted with lies by my family and friends   that they'd be there for me no matter what   No   I am important and loved by myself  By others  I don't believe so  I have so few reasons to believe that  I'll not sugar coat it   I depend on myself for so long   the only light I do see is my own dim light  Until the day human beings can truly connect with each other by sharing real memories  feelings  thoughts and more   selfishness and narcissism  and yes  the global wide spread nature of depression  will be major obstacles in humanity's drive towards a better tomorrow   How can we start to build better societies so far away when people at home suffer  neglected by those they called loved ones  family or friends  Do you see the punch line 
It might seem stupid  but I dont know what that is 
It doesn't matter if she was forced to drink or not  It also doesn't matter if in the moment she resisted because she didn't have her proper faculties to consent  which wouldn't matter anyway because she's under 18  Seriously  what the hell 
I'm glad you think so  thank you   
hmm I didn't know that they had a word for it  
I go to an art class once a week and have been going for just over a year and it has only become easier getting there in the past couple of months  and still occasionally it will be difficult  The only suggestions I have would be doing some more exposure work on days off  it doesn't have to be tasks as difficult as your trip to work  anything that raises your anxiety level will teach your body how to dissipate anxiety  and using more coping tools to help you feel less anxiety while out  grounding  breathing exercises  distraction techniques    
There are things that freak me out  too  people walking into my room when i'm sleeping cause me to panic and freeze   i'm having relationship issues trying to be a normal girl with a boy and have to kind of play a game in my head where i pretend to be normal and ask myself 'how would a normal girl act '  once in a while i get this sense of terror when i walk into a house  like just walking in from the outside triggers me and i start to panic   and cold  i hate the cold  he locked me outside until i was so cold and hungry that i begged to come in  fucking winter   i stay places that are warm and have people  lots of times i just sit quietly in my cafe and just let the feeling of people being there make me feel comfortable  i write about it just to help get it out of my head   in my journal   my therapist asked if i wanted meds but i said no  
You have to allow people to "take your side" while still being able to accept some things you might not want to hear  I am on your side  One thing has to be crystal clear  you are correct  it is not okay how those people treated you  Nothing else I say means that I am defending them  It was not okay   On the other hand  you did allow yourself to keep getting into these situations  In your last paragraph you specifically listed the things you don't want to hear more of  like that you're overreacting or that it's somehow your fault  Well    you can't ask for advice and then tell people what response you want from them  Then it sounds like you think you already have all the answers  so you shouldn't need help from others   There is absolutely nothing in the universe that a human being should be able to say to somebody over a telephone that makes that person think the next 13 years of their life was ruined  Rejection is painful and once again I am not saying that I defend however she treated you  If she said something horrible she is an asshole for doing it  But letting that wreck you for the amount of time you claim it did means there is something missing in you    No matter how other people treat you  harassing them and breaking windows is clearly not okay  You just played into their trap  After all they did you to  it ends up being YOU getting the police called on you and looking like a manic   All I can say is that at this point I certainly hope you understand to have no contact with any of these people or that specific family  If you would ever let this happen again then it is your fault  If that woman called you today and said she wanted to fuck your brains out and marry you and to please forgive her for everything she did  you'd deserve whatever happens next if you fell for it    She sounds like a psychopath  Somebody who is so miserable in their own life that she entertained herself by messing with someone else's feelings  What kind of grown person calls up a man  agrees to meet with them  acts flirty  all so later on they can laugh at you over the phone with two other guys  She's an idiot  But you're an idiot for ever talking to or agreeing to see her again    You've experienced a lot of emotional trauma  no doubt  But the way you titled this post  I expected to come in and read about someone who had battled cancer 5 times and lost their legs or something  There are people who have had worse lives than you  too  Your life got ruined by one stupid group of people that you just should have distanced yourself from as soon as they were mean to you    You did not deserve what happened to you  But what more can be said to help you move on  It's great that you already haven't talked to her for a while  Don't ever do it again    I do understand a lot of the other stuff you talked about  I haven't had any social media either for the past 5 years  and back when I did I only had a few friends too  Since 2012 I have hardly seen anybody  I sit in my house and don't do anything  People mistreated me and the way my friendships and relationships ended caused me to sit around and be miserable for many years of my life too    Everything you spoke about is in the past now  You have to move forward and if you feel like you can't then you may need to try to speak to somebody who can help    Believing that you have the worst life story ever and that people should bookmark this so they can show it to other people who are feeling depressed and snap them out of it  is not a mindset that is going to move you forward in life  You did deal with a lot of bullshit and mistreatment from other people  but you also haven't experienced other types of suffering that people in other parts of the world might be dealing with  But most importantly it just doesn't help you  As they say about anger and resentment  holding onto it is like a grasping a burning rock that only hurts you  It's a poison that only kills you  those other people are living their lives and moving forward    I'll say one final time  you did encounter some very unfair treatment and some sick sick people who got a thrill out of messing with you  You don't have to let it define the rest of your life and you don't have to give up hope  On this planet of billions of people  so much of your mortal existence has already been wrapped up in this stupid woman and what she did to you  That's a real shame  Try as hard as you can to not let a single other day of your life go down the drain ruminating over the things that happened with her    I do believe you're a good person who acted out of frustration and feeling like nobody was on your side  You have to have some self love and self respect that will steer you away from situations like this in the future  You have to be able to like yourself based on a set of standards and ethics that you define for yourself  You can't let your opinion of yourself be defined by other people  because good friends are almost impossible to find these days and there are a lot of predators out there looking for victims  Try to be good to your mom if that's really the only person you have in your life right now    Try to have a better future  It's up to you to want it  Nothing that happened to you has to have any permanent effects  She didn't take your legs from you  she didn't take your life from you  You were embarrassed in some stupid situations but embarrassment can be survived    If you want to cling onto this story and believe that it's impossible to have a life now  you can make that reality come true too  
Which workbook do you have  I'm looking for one now but there are so many  
When I'm feeling down and alone  I listen to a song called  Shits Gonna Be Okay  by I Fight Dragons  It helps a bit    hugs  
Yeah basically  I dunno  I'm just annoyed that I can't be happy 
I have spent all day in the weight vest I got for Christmas  It's adjustable up to 30kg  I've filled it to 15kg which doesn't seem to make much difference to anything  really  But it's too restricting at 30kg 
Yeah  no need for that   I do think that limiting your parents contact with you might be a good first step   Have you checkout out r raisedbynarcissists   They have some solid strategies and support for people like us   I have found the "grey rocking" technique particularly useful 
Yes  Even when no one is watching sometimes I wonder if I'm walking properly when in public  so I start being overly conscious of my legs and then I start walking weird  Sometimes my arms stop moving along with my legs when I do that  or I'll walk with steps that vary in length  or I'll use one leg more than the other one  one moves further than the other repeatedly   or I'll walk but my momement slowly shifts towards one side  so its like I'm turning  and I try to shift the other way to center myself on my path it looks like I'm incapable to walk in a straight line     Nothing is wrong with you  Overthinking is part of our nature  There is probably a way to make it manageable 
Not worth it  All I can say  Learn from your mistakes  better yourself  Killing yourself solves nothing 
same here so many bullshit happened today to the point  that i feel like dying from it 
Read your post  heartaches  I feel truly sorry  I wish you strength  because it's the only thing that can make hard lives easier  
And remember  when you're on a downswing eventually you come back up  You just need to keep on going until then  Have hope  and take care of yourself

what if I was crazy before because this feels like a sample sized version of that 
A couple things to note about sertaline  I take 100 after titrating up to it from 25   The side effects won't come on for the first few days  if you're lucky  you won't notice any  You might get a bad headache for a few days and maybe some urinary retention  After 4 weeks  you'll start to notice the positive and negative results   Your anxiety will fell like it has faded and you'll feel better inside  Most SSRI's  with the exception of Prozac  take time to start working   Good luck  I think you'll be happy with the results  If not  talk to someone about it  Try something out  A lot of picking the right meds is careful guesswork 
You're not insane  Insane people don't know they're insane  or that they're going insane  Therefore you're either overreacting or need help  I suggest you figure that out and work from there  
Well if you want to add me on Steam my nick name is Twyger 
And Moolk  Why don't we call milk moolk  So much better 
I'm sorry this is happening to you  It sounds very similar with what happened to me  I internalized a lot of other people's bullshit and it really messed me up good  I still think back and wonder how people could be so cruel  I left my town  I don't talk to anyone from there anymore  I don't talk to anyone from high school anymore  I barely talk to anyone from university  I went home for the holidays and I realized just how toxic my family has always been  even though they don't understand that they're being toxic  I try to stay away from them as much as possible because they have so much influence over my feelings of self worth   I still have my really awful days even though I'm medicated  I've had a school therapist for a bit but I'd like to find a really good one for dealing with my childhood issues and whatnot  My school therapist suggested I try self compassion meditations   they're a little goofy  but they seem to be working for me  At least  they don't hurt  Maybe they might be helpful 
I'm so happy for you      It may be a rocky road  but at least you're walking down it  You've got this

you really should  it's one of my favorites and i'm sure that as a drummer you'll like it a lot too  and i'd be sad to hear if you quit drumming  i bet you're really good at it and not pursuing something you love is always a tragedy ykno
You are not a piece of shit  
Thank you  It's definitely a relief to know I'm not alone

Perhaps there's a better way of phrasing this for a 15 year old rape survivor  
Quit your job   It might be looked down upon  but you need to worry about your own health first   You are not mentally strong enough to handle that kind of work yet   Go to therapy  or at least try tackling your anxiety by starting small and working your way up to more stressful activities   I don't mean to offend you or make any assumptions  but if your anxiety is consistently acting up at your job  you're probably not doing the company you work for any favors either   The time you spend coping with your anxiety compromises your ability to perform the tasks expected of you  and if it happens too frequently  it becomes a liability   In my opinion  it is okay to quit a job that is too stressful as long as you either look for a job that is less stressful  or you actively work on your stress anxiety tolerance so you can eventually handle the same job or similarly stressful work in the future 
17 beats per min would be the word record by 10 beats tho  I'd chock that one up to bad recording  
I've always looked at my mental health as a war that I'm fighting  I think it helps to imagine a tangible enemy    On that note  good luck fellow solider  Don't be afraid to ask for help  
Pm me im always up for a talk  
   I guess I'm a little weird  I don't feel loved either but it really doesn't bother me  Guess I'm just kind of a loner  I have friends    but I don't see them often  except for one  I guess all I can really say is get out there more  When I found who is today my best and really my only friend it really changed my life  because looking back  our friendship almost didn't even happen  I was too shy or introverted or maybe even stupid to realize how amazing our friendship would be  in the end  it was him who kept texting me  He kept texting and texting and texting and I hated it  but without that friendship    fuck I don't know where I'd be  Get out there  make some friends  and don't let anything hold you back  
You're not alone here  I'm currently on the same boat  It's hard  but believe in yourself and surround yourself with people that care about you  
I'm not and I'm not actually able to see one at the moment  It really is so frustrating because I'm irritating those lymph nodes and on top of that  my wisdom teeth are comming all at once pushing all my teeth so I really feel awful   But I'll really need to visit someone when I'm done with exams because I feel trapped in my own head 
I just wish I could do more  So here is the google search of pugs https   www google ca search q pug pictures num 40 source lnms tbm isch sa X ved 0ahUKEwjbv8OatqbRAhXl7IMKHfGADZsQ AUICCgB biw 1097 bih 556 They are hilarious and creepy  
I did apologize  and they didn't seem to care at all  It still is bothering me  but it does help so thank you 
It isn't about whether or not they care  I'm sorry to say it but if you're only doing it because you want people to care then you're only getting help for the attention and that isn't the point  The point is to make yourself a better person  to be happy  to make a difference  you name it  The point is to have control of your life  That is it  
Yeah  I know I can't handle it  So I've been trying not to try  But it's impossible  I mean someone can read right on your face you aren't feeling good  Anxiety or not  then spurt out at you "it's def cancer" at any time of your day  I'm a mathematician and a man of stadtics  That's what drives me the most insane  I understand the odds of me getting x is under 1   But I understand someone's gotta be that 1     Even tho I'm fairly healthy  I just have horrible posture and a neck muscles that's Torn or tare or cut or whatever the doctor thinks it is 
Thanks    well it only gave me that 17bpm reading for 12 seconds  meaning that theoretically my heart could have paused for a few seconds  causing the average for that brief period to go from 65bpm to 17bpm  That would be scary  Hopefully it was just a bad recording  
 'Those are not delusions  Delusions are things that are out of possibility  Something like the government is following you  aliens  conspiracy theories  alternate realities  or magic powers  Those are delusions  Everyone not liking you is a real possibility'  Heh   This is good information but perhaps could have been communicated more gently   it's bad enough thinking everyone hates you  who needs a professional saying "yeah  that might be true" 
If you think by telling your family that you're depressed is gonna make them sad  then what do you think they will feel if you kill yourself   Pm me tho  im always up for a talk  
I was admitted at the advice of my psychologist  The best advice I can give is to try and stay open about what people are saying  Although I was in a 7 hour outpatient  it took me 5 days to start to listen and be willing to talk   Give them  and yourself  a chance  it's going to feel tacky 
Love is a gamble sadly  It can crush you emotionally if you partake in it    I wish you much love and want you to know you're definitely no less valuable as a human being regardless of what anyone else may think   Stay safe and PM me if you need to talk xx
Yes to meds  and she has received a lot of therapy over the past few years but isn't currently talking to a professional about this and I don't think has ever discussed this particular issue with anyone before  I'm going to try and broach the topic of talking to a therapist about help for this but I know she's unwilling to go back into therapy  this is the first time in several years she hasn't regularly been going to therapy or counselling  I think she doesn't want to take a 'step back' so to speak  
Yeah kind of  My depression comes in the form of me just not wanting to do anything  I just kind of waste my life away in my house  but I think I'm a good person  I guess all of that alone time gives me time to think very philosophically  so I never really give in to that sort of  "I hate myself " shit  
It might be hard to find someone who works with bodily anxieties  It might be worth trying to find them now and asking them to write your teachers about your anxiety  my therapist did that for me and I  benefitted a lot from that  put me in a mindset to deal with or avoid  mostly avoid  my  school  anxieties 
I got there with an "empty tank" at around 11 am

My mom and I saw one of these at the store before Christmas and picked it up  It's awesome to leave on the table  because everyone always finds a few minutes in their day to do one  then my step mom colors them in  It is definitely relaxing  much less stressful than doing sudoku puzzles 
I got one in the check out line at Safeway  with all the magazines  Most grocery stores have little puzzle books and such up there

Thank you  Simply thanks  I have loving people in my life but they just don't understand  Your words give me hope that maybe someday they can  and without having gone through this   The most hurtful thing someone can say to me is "just get over it" without knowing    
My god perfecting the way that I walk has been a battle since the early years of high school  I could always walk normally in a crowd but when I was in situation where there were people behind me but not many in front I would walk like a complete idiot  I would be completely stiff and for somebody that is right handed it was bizarre that my right leg was always out of rhythm with my left  My step length was never consistent  or my speed  or my level of bounciness  Nor could I even keep a straight path but I would slowly walk diagonally    Its taken such a long time but I am finally able to walk like a normal person in public  The biggest thing was realizing that I never notice how other people walk so why would they notice the way that im walking  
I always felt worse if I did nothing productive on a day that I was down    On days when even getting out of bed was a battle  I got a sense of accomplishment from even the smallest things  It may feel impossible  but maybe you should go to school just to do it  To prove to yourself that you can    And who knows  maybe today is the day where you meet a new friend or hear about an interesting club  Or  its just a normal day  Either way  you'll never know if you don't take those first steps out the door    
Not at all  Please  pretty please go talk to your parents and or the school councilor asap

Was a waste of 25 years eh  I'd say you're about to waste 55 years but hell  that's just me 
Oh Jesus  That's incredible  I did 11 days of travel and in North America and I had hit my limit  Congrats on your bravery  
When you're upset  cry your heart out  and then you will come a point when your tears dry up and you cant cry anymore  Nothing will affect you anymore    That's the point  your weakness will equal your strength  and from that point you can only grow stronger  So  never stop yourself from crying out loud  
My apologies  Yeah that was really the only thing I noticed  but I may just be acting overly protective so take my comment with a grain of salt      Edit  I have ADHD and I feel as though I often have trouble with communication as well so I somewhat understand  but in no way am I trying to diminish your difficulty by mentioning mine   I simply wanted to say you're in good company 
Everything is going to sound like worthless bullshit  But try to be open when you can  and remember that everyone there is trying to help  Best wishes   
   I'd totally be willing to try that instead of wanting to die   I've heard that consuming certain kinds of mushroom can come close to "reseting the brain"  But I'm really no expert on this so you might want to ask other people who know more about it  
Thanks    I just have been hit with the worst new years    My wife is filling for devorce   We just had a baby and I'm a wreck    I don't know what to do with my self 
That sucks  its never fun to feel alone    Try to look for love outside of romantic relationships  Friends can offer just as much  if not more  love as a SO  Its just platonic    
You did supergood  Better to be safe than sorry  Great job 
One day at a time   
My mom is similar  She'd always be on my case like study study study   I feel like it just served to make me hate studying which sucks because I've always believed studying could be enjoyable w the right approach but it feels like she never cared about that aspect of it   When I help my niece w her homework  she doesn't enjoy it  but I try to do my best to actually make it somewhat meaningful for her instead of just being some chore she has to do    I'm in the same boat as you and have an exam in under a week that I'm not fully prepared for but I'm just like fuck this fuck this fuck this  I'm sorry tho   it sucks for sure   Stay safe and PM if you need to talk xx
Im with you  
Take a shower  It's like magic  I swear  or like  u d co said  go for a small walk  Even if you don't feel like it  
Try to see ocd as a thought process rather than focusing on particular elements of it  For instance it's really helped me to break it down into   Obsession  intrusion a feeling etc  Compulsion  behaviour can be physical or mental to bring down anxiety    Then you can apply it to so many different things and they don't seem as scary as you can see that it's the same process but just applied itself to different things like contamination or health anxiety   Check out cognitive behavioural therapy    
Theres nothing shameful about needing meds  I've been on three different SSRIs  and have a couple Xanex for when my anxiety gets bad  Mental illness is often caused by a chemical imbalance  and medication can help fix that    Also  I think you would benifit from visiting  r anxiety as well  
I would try a relationships forum instead  But if it only lasted a day I'm sure it's for the better  Tell him to learn from it and use it to focus on future relationships  
Thank you  I hope whatever is bothering you sorts itself out  X
Thanks  I just feel incredibly stupid and blindsided  
Long story  I have a post in my history with details   9 years older than me  Met when I was 16 at my part time job  Emotionally and financially abusive and controlling  Almost 100  sexless and I wasn't allowed to complain about that or really anything  7 years of my life wasted  I'm still processing it but I have the tools to do so now  He was a very damaged person  Looking back with a clear head I think he may have suffered abuse early in his life but we never talked about it  He was legitimately addicted to porn and finding the extent of that and some finances was the last straw  Leaving destroyed me because I knew I had been his only friend for years and years and years and I didn't want to desert him but I didn't love him anymore and could no longer stay with someone dragging me down  I was depressed and suicidal for a long time because I didn't know how else to get out  We had just bought a house together and the day we divorced I was 24 and moved out of state and was still trying to sell our house  It was crazy stressful and my anxiety has never been higher  I broke up with my best friend boyfriend within a year of living here and hit rock bottom being completely alone  It's been a steady rebuild for about a year and a half alone here in Minneapolis but I'm very happy now  Happy lives take slowly building and some risk and a bit of luck  I am SUPER LUCKY more than anything  
Do it and keep us updated 
I was feeling it yesterday  I stayed in bed till 3pm and even then it was a struggle  I just didn't want to deal with the world  
Why did you stop taking them  Did you consult your doctor before doing so 
I'm still learning how to drive  but what helped me is that my dad just made me start and stop on a hill that's not too steep  If you'd roll back on this  it's really slow  The idea behind this is just exposure  Keep doing it in an area where there's no or little traffic until you know nothing bad will happen  You'll probably still be scared the first few weeks months  but that's okay  Fear is okay 
Then the important thought is that you realize how to build yourself up from your past  
I'm already home  I had an appointment with a psychiatrist that was set up by my physician  It was a month away and was the earliest available time  Going to the ER successfully moved my appointment up to tomorrow  Had they not been able to get me an appointment they would have admitted me  I basically promised not to "hurt myself" before tomorrow  
I've got that feeling today where you can't even be bothered to talk   you know what you need to do to feel better but it just requires an inhuman amount of strength  I really hope you feel better  Thank you for commenting  X

Hi again   I'm really glad you're taking positive steps to get healthy   Being willing to seek help is a huge step   and I'm proud of you   even if I don't really know you   So   What are your hobbies  I'm pretty nerdy   I play a lot of video games and read a lot   
Yeah  I have to fight the surge of anxiety when he asks how my day was and it was bad  The easiest way for me is to take a deep breath and try to say "not good" or if anxiety is really bad shake my head no    Maybe try texting him about it  It can be easier to get thoughts out when you can see them before hitting send 
Is there any school counselor you can talk to  Might help with some of your problems and even make finding friends easier 
Yuup  You're literally fighting your own brain and it sucks ass    I have days where I feel 'normal'  but they can be a battle to reach  I keep myself going with promises of  one day  and  someday  and  eventually  I'll be okay every day  but why the fuck isn't  someday  today     slams head on desk 
In a nutshell  expose yourself slowly to steeper and steeper hill parks and driving  Take a friend with you  Use a diary and record your thoughts before for example   I thought I was going to die and fall back etc  Then record what actually happened  Read this everyday as you add new entries to your diary of success  And if you roll back   that's what the brake is for  perfectly safe  Good luck 
At first I thought you meant it was a connect the dot puzzle that turned into porn or something lol 
You can learn that your scary thoughts are not reality and reality will almost always work out better than you imagine   which you will clearly be able to see with your iary upon completion of a few entries  
good point 
I am the exact same way  Nearly every minute I'm living in a fantasy world where all my dreams have come true and I'm surrounded by people who make me happy and totally understand me   I know it's not the most healthy way to live and spend my time   but it's the only way for me to survive and not go crazy in this world

I don't know why I have a tupla but the fact I formed when I was a younger and the was only kid on my street might play a role 
I feel better today  I let myself feel like shit yesterday with the understanding that I would get to the gym this morning and be productive at work  Going to the gym in the morning is a huge part of my fight against my depression and I am still riding the endorphin buzz  I'm not being too productive at work but that's mostly because we're slow right now   Here's something I do when I'm feeling overwhelmed  I think of one simple thing I can do and call an accomplishment  Maybe it's taking a shower and brushing my teeth on a really bad day  Maybe it's do a load of laundry  Or maybe mow the lawn  But it's one simple thing  8 10 I wind up doing more than the one thing  1 10 I just do the one thing  And  of course  that last 1 10 is the times when it just doesn't work  But  I'll take those odds    Hope you feel better soon  
First days can be very bad  Patience 
You can easily change your steam account id via the Steam site   I'm also looking for a new community and I heard good thing about guild wars 2 i bought the new expansion and started playing but working full time is hard on a gaming lifestyle   From what I hear the guild wars 2 community is really good so I would suggest that 
Thank you  I'm going to buy both books  I love reading  in English too   
Sorry about that   Have you tried to distract your mind by thinking about other things while brushing   I'm guessing you already tried different flavored toothpaste 
 Here is my backpack flying home    http   imgur com DDUG78Z   There were days I had to be out of my hostel by 11 am and didn't leave for the next city until evening so I would carry it all day  I had a decent backpack  looking back I wish I had invested money into a real traveling backpack  Mine had 3 compartments  The hardest part for me as a somewhat high maintenance person was no hair dryer  My hair was short and was a mess most of that trip  I got a hot iron brush to tame it in the AM and showered at night in my hostel  The worst was shoes  I wore hiking boots almost everywhere but I had one pair of nice flats  I didn't have room for tennis shoes  With outfits I traveled city to city in my bulkiest items  boots and sweater jacket   I rolled all my clothes very tightly into cylinders and stacked them vertically inside my backpack  I kept a small umbrella in my bottle sleeve  I basically had a long blue blouse I wore almost everywhere over leggings  I had one t shirt for sleeping and a couple nice dresses that didn't wrinkle  I washed my clothes once when I was at a hostel with a nice laundry room  Sometimes I rewore undies and socks  yeah      For make up I just had the basics  foundation and some mascara and eyeliner and one lipstick  I did 4 cities on that trip so as far as clothes go  I wasn't too concerned about a variety  I had small baggies full of Tylenol or whatever in tiny backpack pockets  It was hard for me too cause I love being prepared  
I totally feel where you're coming from here   I had a friend who went through a very bad couple of years and I ended up being one of her only supports    I didn't handle it very well  because I didn't take good care of myself while I was helping her     I think you're doing your best here   It is going to have to be on her timeline  when and if she fully heals from what happened   I know you have absolutely wonderful intentions  but I'm sure you also know that you can't rush or force her into behavior that she isn't ready for     Being open to listen and to provide support is so valuable   That alone can make a huge difference   I personally wouldn't be here without the support system that I had  although it was small   I'd say keep being that resource  keep growing yourself  and when she is ready to reach for a hand up she will know where to find it   I realize that probably isn't the answer you are looking for here and I wish there was some kind of cure for those negative feelings  but I haven't ever found it myself   just support and time 
It sucks doesn't it     I feel like shit when people assume that I lay in bed a whole day or eat cereal for dinner because I'm lazy  And that if I "just" put a little effort in I wouldn't be so sad   "Just think positive " "Why are you so negative all the time " "You create your own happiness"  If it "just" were that easy I would already have done it  Does people really think that someone would feel like this if there was a choice 
Been there  My last year of college was rough  I had no idea how I got by  You're gonna make it and it's going to be so worth it

Do you like coffee  Go put a pot on  and make yourself a cup  The ritual of it  and the caffeine  helps me get motivated to do    something    Also  an easy thing would be to go grab a book and read it in your livingroom  
Life sucks  It's true  BUT you don't suck  YOU are AWESOME  You know why  Because 9 years with this illness makes you a God damn HERO that's why  Believe it or not but many many people don't even make it 5 years let alone 9  You are amazing and powerful  Keep at it depression can be beaten  and you can do it  Try and get some help somewhere  a Doctor or try making one of those friends a little closer  People might not understand but they instinctively want to help rather than push away someone who is honest in their feelings  You are amazing and beautiful keep at it  One day at a time 
I totally agree with the last part you said  90  of the time there's no problem at all with going alone  But the last movie I went to see  Rogue One  and I'm a huge star wars fan  I really wanted to have someone with me to talk about the movie with after it was over 
Im here to talk if you want   
It's short for General Education Development   It's a program available for drop outs or people tired of the drudgery of the institution  which in the continental United States must be respected at the same level as a high school degree  Basically  take 6 months of class  take a test  so yeah it's still work  but you can do it on your own time and your own way  My brothers been struggling with the same lack of motivation to complete the drivel monotony of high school  so he's taking steps to move past it on his own terms  in a practice way  You can claim the independence you want  and still have the basic education credit needed to succeed in society  Would strongly recommend you check it out  
GOOD LUCK  That is also how I started  I did a week in Seattle alone fall 2015 and I was a mess the day before just picturing myself not going to the airport and missing the entire trip   I listened to an audiobook about anxiety and depression and people were interviewed in segments between chapters who had overcome it  The author goes "look at you  Now you're flying everywhere all by yourself  To the Philippines and all over the globe"  I thought  that's cool  Too bad that will never be me  I can't even get on a plane to go to a domestic city alone  
Good on you  I started that this year too  and honestly feel like it has helped me maintain a baseline in a way I don't normally  or haven't since I hit puberty   Best of luck  and I'm happy to PM if you want to talk about anything 
This is what I want to feel  Setraline didn't work for me  but I really hope my new Wellbutrin will  
I had this happen except it was a customer  I told him my friend commited suicide and he still asked for help rather than leaving  I was so embarrassed  I helped him and he left without a word 
Congrats  That's amazing  You just have to jump in and realize how capable you are  Go you  
Where do you want to go  
I take a very low dose of Xanex as needed for my anxiety  but you may want something thats more chronic    I am of the opinion that going off your meds because you feel okay is a bad idea  I also come from a family of people with lifelong mental illnesses  like bipolar   so my opinion is likely skewed  
Well he didn't leave me because of my depression  or at least I don't think  I didn't really get a clear answer from him  but it certainly didn't help the downward spiral I was headed in already  I'm sorry that happened to you
Could not have said it better  Once you get yourself there and realize you are capable it is the most liberating and intoxicating feeling to have CONTROL   The world is open beyond your work and neighborhood  It's huge and unlocked  The world is a playground now and everything is possible 
I'm glad you're feeling better  That's great advice  I think my one thing I'll set myself to do is tidy my room as it's a mess  I'm seeing my counsellor tomorrow which I'm really hoping will help  I know so many people have it worse but I'm just in that mindset today where you just think 'why did I have to get depression and anxiety ' How different my life would be without it  But I do believe there are positives to it too   even on the worst days like today  Thank you for your kind words  I really hope you continue to feel better  
Thanks  I'm really interested in finding out what worked for people  And the paid or free ones don't have much reviews  Either people with SA don't want to be linked to it or the online services don't have much traction  Or maybe they simply don't work 
I would totally buy a connect the boobs
No this is a great response  Thank you so much  I personally feel lost in helping her  so just even being told that listening and being there for her is helpful to her is helpful to me  sorry this is a mouthful  lol   I obviously don't go around talking to people we both know about what I should do to get her help  so I just felt feel really lost in all of this because I'm not sure if I'm actually helping doing enough  I question my own instincts in helping her because I'm not sure if it's the right thing    So yes  this is a perfect response      Thank you  again  I truly appreciate the honesty  
For what it's worth  I've had this depression almost my whole life  I always thought it was a joke and that being a "man" you just deal with shit  For about 14 15 months I've been seeing a psychologist and the past 3 4 months a Psychiatrist for medication  NOTHING has been working and I'm starting to get pissed off and MORE anxious  I know both said it would be a process but my list of medication that doesn't work just keeps growing  It's frustrating to say the least    On the 24th I have some  6 hour test  Apparently this Dr is the best at what she does and will test for everything from ADHD to whatever else   I've been in and out of this sub forever reading and I never wanted to post but today I just don't care I guess  Maybe it'll help  We'll see    Anyway  my Psychiatrist was the one who recommended the testing because my medication wasn't working and a very close friend of mine takes Adderall and he said it changed his life  I asked for that and he said no  Then he asked if I would be willing to try some testing  I said of course  Then I got pissed because I'm wondering why he didn't ask me that from the get go    Long story short  it's going to be a process like others have said unless you get lucky  Good luck  too  I really hope you find something that helps  I wish I would of started earlier looking for help instead of pretending as a man I should just deal with it   Edit  Of all the shit I've taken  I've had no side effects  Although this last one required blood work after a week so after two pills I stopped taking it  I'm not taking anything more until after the testing 
Coz anxiety is stupid  Your brain goes into fight or flight mode even though it doesn't need to  but if it did during the situations you mentioned  it would be right in doing so  
I know about it  I even do the rhythmic motion too  usually throwing something up and then catching it  It gives me a rush of excitement and makes me forget about my problems  but I worry I'll never do anything about them because of it 
Somehow we're in the same boat  Sometimes i hate being shy and have social anxiety  bcs people tends to take advantage of me alot  And i just let them  However  i try to overcome it by downloading chatting dating apps  At first i just talk to people in there  even when people asked to meet up i didnt go  But as more and more people i talk to  few people make it easy for me to step up my game and meet them in person  And that is actually how i overcome it  Meet them in person as a way to challenge myself to beat social anxiety with baby steps  familiarize myself with communicating people from different backgrounds  different way of thinking  etc   somehow you learn alot from different types of people you'll meet  
Well I might check it out 
Oh that sucks   
I understand how you feel but quitting your job seems rather extreme in this case  Especially in this economy it's not easy to find anew job    Think about it  everyone was probably busy thinking about their own presentation  Did you know a day before that you will need to present  What helps me is to practice my presentation over and over so maybe you can try this as well  I am sure that other people didn't think anything about your "secret"  Next time you see your coworkers you can joke that you had "one of those days"  
Great question  I got asked this a lot  Google com flights and kayak are great ways to investigate airfare  Planning ahead saves money  Airbnb  Hostelworld and Hotels com are great websites I used frequently to get cheap accommodations  If you can host couch surfers you can get a reputation on their website and stay for free too but I never have  I have a friend who puts all his stuff  rent  bills  etc  on a credit card and you can get cash back or miles to use  Often I would skip breakfast and lunch or hoard free breakfast items  I ate a lot of protein bars  Usually I only would eat out for dinner and my alcohol intake was very limited towards the end of the year  Personally  I got a promotion this year so money was better than in years past  I also got a different and much cheaper apartment this last fall to save money and adjusted my lifestyle a lot  I don't eat out very often  It's possible if you commit but I'm also very fortunate and lucky  I'm single income worth no kids and not wealthy by any stretch  but debt free and have worked my way into a great career  It was a very slow build  Edit  I used about 35 days of PTO in total  I would stack weekends and comp days when I used to work weekends  I did 3 days in DC on no PTO  I traveled no where my first year at this job and built up a large bank of vacation time  
I'm not having one of those days  I'm having one of those lives boy   I'm literally too much of a pussy to do anything except sleep  and even that I probably only do because it's the most passive thing possible  All I've been doing for weeks now is sit on my pc and sleep  and yet I'm still so tired that even taking a shower takes 3 days of motivation and working up to it   The thing is  I wouldn't mind if it only affected myself  but I'm directly hurting people who I love with it and affecting their life too  which fucking sucks man

Progress will come slowly  be patient with it  Good for you to take the first step and I wish you well 
I'm sorry that you were triggered after enjoying yourself on NYE   Taking advantage of someone who is inebriated  having enjoyed a moderate amount of alcohol or a lot of alcohol  is a crime  An inebriated person cannot consent to sexual activity  This is  never  the fault of the survivor  Only the abuser is responsible for his behavior choices   Your experience on NYE is what  should  happen when some has enjoyed more than their limit of alcohol  Your partner got you home safely  got you into bed and cleaned up after you  Unfortunately during your prior experience someone felt entitled to sexually assault rape you instead of helping you to find a safe place and leave you alone to sleep it off   If you continue to have intrusive thoughts and distress you might try some grounding techniques  The one that I am most familiar with is to focus on what you can feel and name 5 things  then 4  then 3  2 and 1 thing that you feel  You can go through all the senses this way while slowing your breathing  You can look up other grounding techniques online   Take good care of yourself 
You're not a pussy  you're dealing with a mental illness and you mustn't punish yourself further  I know how that feels though  I hope you can find something that helps motivate you and you feel better  
The fucker decided to become an absolutist  I have tried that but it was no use 
Thank you  I haven't cried in months  I was also hoping it would make me cry  Didn't work
Hey friend        The love of my life  my fiance  kicked me out before Xmas   and said she feels like she had been living a lie    That she didn't want this life with me        Im broken   I'm sad   I have not gotten out of bed much   I've contemplated killing myself       Then I think of what I could be missing   I love her so much   and I'm tore into little pieces but I remember all the good times we had   The end wasn't good   but everything else was wonderful and that's what makes me miss her so       I am learning to love myself and realize there is a whole world out there   Maybe it's not at your door   but it's out there      Please don't end it friend   Be sad   be broken   but know it will pass   Know that this gives you perspective later in life       If you want to talk   I'm here   I'll even call you   Lord knows I could use some friends as well   Just know that even though it feels like it   you are not alone

I think your right  I was just using that to show that I didn't even think about the times where I saw Aliens as being a delusion  Lol  Or my belief that my Bipolar is actually some form of a magic power  Or that we are all God and through mediation and reaching enlightenment we too can walk on water and heal the blind  and have made important life choices based on these beliefs  Didn't even cross my mind  lol  And even after he said those things I still didn't think they were delusions  I just thought I was more enlightened then him  Lol    I do think though this idea feeling that everyone hates me is definitely a grey area and a prominent problem in my life and I do need to go to counseling to work through how much of that is real and how much it is in my head for sure

The very best you can do is to take baby steps and explore whenever you get the chance  You'll build confidence as you slowly find yourself in new situations and realize you didn't die     Even if it was super embarrassing  move on and learn  I find that building that skill was my strongest tool in overcoming anxiety  The thought of getting lost or stranded or losing my phone or wallet or rental car key is enough to make me stay inside and never leave  I also don't like crowds very much  I got over a lot of my social anxiety through forcing myself to do meet up 
1  He doesn't do forums or Reddit  he is more of those who goes daily to gym  2  Everyone has  but he is still fucked up because of it 
I'm sorry for your loss    And I also thank you for your words  I needed to hear them  
 First of all  I'm so sorry this happened to you  Don't feel embarrassed  As a mom I can tell you that two adults acting the way those men did is disgusting and probably criminal  They are the ones who should be embarrassed and feeling like they want to die  not you    The most important thing is to protect yourself from STDs and pregnancy  You can call a rape crisis hotline  1 800 656 HOPE  and ask about local treatment options  Planned parenthood or a women's health clinic can also help you  Some local crisis centers can connect you with a trained adult who can help you through the exam  and through the legal process if you choose  so you aren't alone   If you trust your parents  I recommend talking to them about what happened  And definitely speak with someone anonymously on the hotline  Even supportive parents sometimes can't relate  or don't know how to support you    If you get a rape kit done  you don't have to decide today what to do  It's there  in case you decide to press charges later    You are not alone  And the most important thing to do is guard your physical health  and your mental well being  The police can help you with a restraining order or pressing charges  but they aren't always trained to be sensitive and understanding about trauma  If you go to the police and they are insensitive  don't take it personally  or as a judgement on your worth or honesty  They're just doing their job    Best of luck to you  I'm sorry you went through that  and I know sometimes the embarrassment about your peers talking about you can be the worst part  But it's not your fault  Reach out for help and support  It's there for you 
What if others are dealing with it too but they just don't cry about it on reddit like me and actually push through it or whatever  That's what I think  
I was going to let this conversation drop as I have to get back to pretending to work but something you said struck a nerve with me    "I know so many people have it worse   "  Nope  nope  nope  This is a very unhealthy thought process to ride  There is always someone who has it worse and if you start comparing your problems relative to others then you'll just feel like shit for feeling like shit  I spent my teens and 20's in this spiral  I finally learned that my problems matter  The things that make me feel like shit  external or internal  are important because they are impacting my life  My depression isn't as bad as my friend Robyn's but she's still there to help me when I'm down  My friend Jeff is bipolar and his lows are way lower than mine  But he still listens when I reach out  Don't negate your feelings  And for damn sure don't let anyone else    Sorry if I sounded like a dick there  Bit of a pet peeve of mine that fucked my life up pretty bad for a long time  
Do update us with the results   
Please dont   
Fuck man that's rough  People are going to tell you that they only want to help  but it depends on the hospital  I know two of my friends were unwillingly admitted  we're minors  after suicide attempts  The one I'm closer to told me a bit about it and it was awful  Absolutely awful  She told her mother that if she ever put her in that ward again  she would kill herself just to prove a point  Hang in there  Hopefully your facility is better  
man the parents which do this are the worst  my childhood where my friends used to go out and play  I used to spend studying  and now they and I are same place no difference  only difference is in everything else which they can do and I can't  
Thank you so much for the reply  I've never heard of occupational therapy before but I'm definitely interested  it sounds like something that could help me a lot mentally judging by your description of it  the same with befriending services  Maybe it'd push my family into giving me a bit of support with stuff too  who knows   I'd love to do something like go to the gym or go back to school and I appreciate the suggestions and support but you're right  it would be one of the bigger if not biggest steps for me and I have no doubt in my mind I'd end up having a panic attack if I tried it  and I've not had one of those for ages and don't really wanna break my record just yet haha  That'd be jumping straight into the deep end  plus extreme exercise triggers my fibromyalgia like nothing else  I can hardly even walk 100 meters without major pain at the moment so extensive gym use isn't an option at the moment    Housebound sounds like the right word to describe how I am  as much as I dislike having to admit that  Thank you so much for the advice and for taking the time to reply to me  I'll try and think of some small but slightly anxiety inducing steps for myself and work from there as soon as I have the time to  I do have things to do despite being housebound lol   I'll admit I'd been in a major depressive state for a couple days and when I posted this so apologies to everyone for how negative everything is 
Of course you aren't imagining things hun 3 it's normal for survivors of sexual crimes and this DOES count as one to feel guilty or blame themselves  It's good that you're trying to remind yourself that you were not at fault  I am so sorry that you were out through this  It really is a shitty thing that he did    Is he still trying to contact you   Sorry  I am on the mobile app and can't read the original post to refer to it  so that's why I am asking   Does he only have your snap chat or does he also make attempts to text you contact you on the regular messaging apps  
Agreed  It did lead to a total emotional breakdown in this meeting too  He's actually kind of an inconsiderate and insensitive doctor  I'm starting back up my counseling and Meds again after a hiatus  and think I will be looking for a new doctor and see how it goes  
Just got back from my doctor  got my first Lexapro RX  really happy to come here for the first time to see this post at the top   I'm nervous too  I've never taken anything like an anti depressant before 
are tuplas able to affect me physically cause that happens sometimes  
Remember to be patient with it  Sometimes drugs like this can take some time to really show what they can do for you 
Thanks  that sounds really nice   It's software testing  with a little bit of development on the main project after I've been there a while    I can only hope it goes that well for me  
Thanks for the response  Your sharing of your positivity and experience helps  if just to know that someone hears me that understands  Looking at your comment history you help a lot of people and don't get a lot of comments back  You are appreciated friend  
Yes it was     It was actually really genius in terms of how most of Mac's arguments go  I also love the "donkey brains" thing with Frank    I just love this show period haha  I can't wait till the new season  
Thank you very much   
I personally think the worst thing you can do is make yourself feel worse when you're already really low  but I also understand the mentality where you can't help but beat yourself up  I know how it feels to feel like you're a burden to everyone else  And to hurt other people who so want you to be happy  If posting on Reddit makes you feel better  then absolutely do it 
It will be good  What is the part that gives you the most anxiety  Is it getting and going through the airport or just the flight itself  Or the destination 
I'll edit it to say 'Which could possibly be true   ' 
I needed this today  Thank you  you don't sound like a dick  this was a really helpful comment x
Don't over think this  You absolutely did  not  overreact  Just think about how you'd feel if you hadn't called the police and something bad happened to the woman  When it involves looking out for other people it's always better to "overreact" than not react at all 
You did good buddy  Feel proud   
You're a good friend  You're trying to fix this for her and you're struggling because you can't  You'll never be able to fix it completely  It sounds like you're doing everything right  giving her resources  not judging her for not utilizing them  not pressuring her to get help  making sure she knows you'll always be there for her and that you want to help  It seems to me that you're doing everything right    Just keep in mind that her healing process may look different than yours  even though you endured similar traumas  It's okay to let her know that you're still concerned about her  Maybe tell her about some of the concerns you've written here    At the end of the day  remember that sexual assault is about power and control  Her power   control was taken away from her the day she was raped  So  as a support system for your friend  the best thing you can to is to try and give her as much power   control back into her life as possible  Encourage her to make her own decisions  even if you would do things differently  In addition to a great support system  she also needs to feel like she's in control   
I think most people get put on that first   I was unable to orgasm while on it lol   So I went on another 
Doooo it It's legit
Haha I definitely need a better sleep routine  I actually got blood test results back recently that said I have a vitamin D deficiency from just how awful and late I sleep  That's something I'm constantly working on  although I slept earlier than usual last night and had the worst nights sleep I've had in ages so that's definitely going to take me some time   I hear a lot of good things about tea so I should probably try some new ones aside from regular black or green teas  Thanks so much for the suggestions  I'll be keeping them in mind  I'll check out that app too  People always say I'm young and have lots of time but it always feels like my time is running out somehow  it's a really awful feeling but just I think I'm just a bit paranoid  Thank you 
Sweet     I have to say I think season 7 is one of my favorites  I also love the episode when the gang decides to go on a road trip and Dee gets shitfaced in the car  picks up that teenager  and tries to convince him not to run away to California  where she thinks his future will be a male prostitute  by singing that "Runaway Train" song to him  Every time that song comes on over the radio at my work it makes me think of that and I crack up  
Thanks  Reach out if you ever need to talk  Good luck at your session tomorrow  
I thought for a second you just called him a piece of shit  I was seriously about to go into battle against you 
Hello      I'm so glad your life turned around  It sounds like there are some really good things in it right now     I completely understand the thought of "my life's good now so I SHOULD be happy " Try to reframe that thought      The wonderful things in your life right now can't erase or cancel out the effects of your past trauma  The trauma was never processed so unfortunately it's still "trapped" in your nervous system and your mind  I'm not sure if you can ever "get over it" but you are absolutely capable of reprocessing the trauma and healing from it       Your history will always be your history but through therapy it won't always sting  trigger you or have a hold over you      At the moment since your PTSD has not yet been addressed  OF COURSE you feel depressed and anxious  You are not wrong at all for having these feelings  It's a perfectly normal response  The depression and anxiety you're feeling has to do with your past  it is NOT a reflection of how appreciative you are of the good things in your current life     I understand the nervousness about your upcoming therapy  That also is natural  Yes  there will be uncomfortable moments in therapy  Maybe think about it like you're taking care of a wound that you've had for a long time and has become infected  The healing process is going to hurt a lot in the beginning  taking the bandage off  disinfecting the wound  Very painful      but necessary if you'd like it to heal  Know that going in  that way you're not going to run away or quit therapy when you feel anxiety during therapy      The beautiful thing is that when you start healing  you will be able to feel more joy from the good things in your day to day life like your husband and child  Try to envision this  what your life looks and feels like when you can "access" that joy  Keep a mental picture of it in your mind  Recall this picture whenever you feel nervous at any stage during therapy       It's not easy or quick but it's doable  You're a survivor  You survived your past so I already know how strong you are  You can do it  You are worth it  Life on the other side of therapy is worth it      Much love to you  Have courage 
I'm here if you want to talk
yeah SSRIs typically say 4 weeks to feel
I take hypnotic sleep medications  They help me let go of a portion of my anxiety before I fall asleep  They also make my memory of my dreams fuzzy and since I otherwise fight sleep  it's the only way I can keep a regular sleep schedule  
I feel like I agree with that point  but also like I would extend that to other groups people as well  including groups other than white groups  It always seems like the small percentage of extremists grab any excuse they can to get crazy  and unfortunately those small groups get the majority of the attention  After watching that video I feel like that guy is a prime example  On a side note it's infuriating to see how much he relishes in creating conflict and drawing attention to himself  He has this expression that almost suggests some underlying issues 
I hope things get better for you 
   
Did your Doc test you for Thyroid problems  Mine recently found this and it was REALLY affecting my energy as well  Most Doctors don't think to test for this on men  as it is more commonly diagnosed in women    but she tested me because I have family who have the same problem  I can't say that it's a huge improvement  but added with my other meds It is a lot easier to work at least 
Prozac takes time to start working  too 
Well your appointment is today  but feel free to shoot me a PM with absolutely everything you want to complain about  I know what it feels like to want to tell someone  anyone   something  anything  It's tough  But you're not alone 
I found that doing some intensive therapy in an IOP really helped me to counter the social anxiety   paranoia I experienced  If you have the time for something like that  I'd highly recommend it  
As in  my roommates are all chill people who don't subscribe to extremist ideology   White supremacy neo Naziism "alt right" is also a form of identity and racial politics  which a lot of the thinkpieces I've read fail to acknowledge  If there's going to be criticism of identity politics  it needs to be balanced  I'm concerned about the safety of low income  immigrant  including undocumented   POC  Muslim  Jewish  Sikh  queer  and disabled people  I'm concerned about alienation  harassment  and bullying in schools  which is where a lot of my anxiety stems from   I'm concerned about policies that will harm institutions  communities  and individuals that have suffered for decades  For me  at least  these are all concerns regarding basic safety  dignity  respect  and well being  I want people to be able to live their lives without fear and with their civil rights intact   When it comes to crossing the political divide regarding identity politics  I'm not sure what the best option is for the left as a whole  At their roots  the demands of many activist movements and groups on this side of the spectrum are pretty basic  stop killing us  end hate crimes speech  etc   and it's difficult to separate those from identity as people are being targeted and harmed on the basis of identity  I'd like to read more on what people recommend for much larger and broader center left organizations like the DNC  which already has a lot of work to do regarding voter mobilization  internal politics  and candidate lineup IMO 
Hey  That's a great idea  I started following you  my username is https   www instagram com alextakesonanxiety  if anyone else is interested feel free to follow me   
Wow that's really freaking harsh  I'm sorry he changed  
You're the best thing that's ever happened to someone  You might not feel that way  but you are  You are loved  you are cherished and each day is a new day to start over    Give em hell  friend  
I appreciate your post  Thanks  The question "am I delusional or not " can definitely be inadequate for understanding your beliefs  When I'm trying to assess a problematic belief or thought process  I think about it along three axes  each scaled from 1 100   First axis is probability  where 1 is "this is a proven  verifiable thing that is currently happening " and 100 is "this is impossible " Second axis is degree of belief  where 1 is "I do not believe this" and 100 is "I believe this with every fiber of my being " Third axis is degree of distress  where 1 is "this doesn't bother me" and 100 is "this is so upsetting that I'm in a constant state of panic and unable to function "    Very few things are impossible  but some things are so vanishingly improbable as to essentially be the same thing  "I can teleport to Mars this afternoon" can pretty easily be rounded up to a 100  Whereas  say  "the FBI is keeping close personal tabs on me" could span more or less the entire range depending on your political activities     When your second axis doesn't square with the first  there's an issue  and it helps to discuss with a trusted third party    a therapist  a close friend    to try to figure out what's up  If I am 100  convinced that the FBI is following me  but it's objectively unlikely that they'd be so invested in my activities  I want someone to persuade me of that latter part  particular if this belief is really upsetting to me or keeping me from doing things  Which is the third axis     You can also believe in things that you  know  are impossible  which sounds completely contradictory    but human minds are  I believe  and I'm not being facetious with this  that I could speak Russian in an emergency  I have never studied Russian on even the most elementary level  but I believe I could do it in the same way that a mother can lift a car off her baby    fueled by adrenaline and  in my case  an ability to tap into the collective unconscious and draw language from it  Do I  know  this is ridiculous  Yep  Is it  to quote the language of religious discrimination laws  a "sincerely held belief"  Yep  And since it doesn't bother me at all  and isn't dangerous   that should probably be a fourth axis   I don't feel the need to try to reality check my way out of it     Your belief that everyone hates you sounds  using the language of psychology  anyway  more like a cognitive distortion than a delusion  but I think what matters more than the terminology is how you are able to disprove or minimize this belief  and decrease the amount of pain it causes you      Anyway  I hope you feel better  and it is extremely unlikely that everyone hates you    
What is IOP  
Same thing would happen with my but i'm too scared of being alone to stop messaging or talking to them 
I know this is meant to be funny but check lists of the most mundane "easiest" things help me when I'm at my most anxious  lack focus etc  
I wish life was kinder for the both of us     please don't give up    not just yet  I'm still alive because some part of me still wants to live  to feel  to give myself a chance at happiness    but right now all the pain in my system overrides the happiness I can envision  I hope you find peace   I hope I do too  I hope we make it through this    I hope we can get rid of our demons and start living the life we have always dreamt of  I really hope we do  
This is beautiful  thank you for sharing    Do you have a sexual assault advocate who can stand by your side at court  If not  do you know if your local area has a women's center that offers court advocacy  Court advocates can be a huge help through a super nerve racking situation   You seem strong regardless  You should be so proud of yourself for going through the process  regardless of the outcome of the hearing  Stay strong 
Girlfriend  theres nothing you can do except to really put yourself out there  If youre not comfortable meeting people outside  theres alot of apps nowadays that can help you  However  it comes to the issue that its not easy for you to get close to people  the only key is to never give up  Even if you have talk to 20 people and you cant find the chemistry  you never know the 21st would be the one where you clicked  So my advice is to really put yourself out there    Less time with close friends  we cant really run away from this problem  Bcs people have their own life  especially when theyre in a relationship  married  have kids  etc  But maybe you can suggest a fixed meet up  for example every Sunday for breakfast  However  it doesnt hurt for you to get new friends though  It doesnt mean you will forget your old friends  
Cool  Yeah maybe try to aim for 10am or something like that  It's not that early  but not that late either  It's hard to motivate yourself  or at least myself  to get up earlier than that unless there's a good reason to  ie  work or school or whatever  There will definitely be an adjustment period though so it will probably suck for a few days or more  but long term it will be better for your life in general  Maybe to make it easier you could get up at 2pm for a week  1pm the next  and so on until you get to 10am   Regarding teas  just remember that herbal teas  like the ones I mentioned  are not the same plant as actual tea  Black  green  and white teas are all from the same plant and all contain varying levels of caffeine  while the teas I mentioned are all different plants and contain no caffeine  You might know that already  but I've come across a lot of people in life who don't know this so I figured I'd mention it 
Best is to get chatting dating apps  Doesnt mean you have to date anyone from there  but its a good way to practice on how to communicate with people    also way of learning more about life through people from diverse background  
This reminds me of when my mom passed when I was only 3 years old  and I never got to know her  You are lucky that you got to spend time with your mom  cherish those moments and never forget them

Gotta start somewhere  
Understandable question to have  However  no one here can give medical advice   citalopram and other SSRIs do indeed have the potential to have problematic interactions with alcohol  but it's important to check with your doctor for recommendations specific to your medical history and situation  
Since a period of 3 5 months a few years ago when I had a string of panic attacks  very intrusive thoughts about driving my car off the road during my commute  and intrusive thoughts of violently and vividly hurting people  I've really struggled with working  as I flash back and feel a strong fear of all those things happening again   I had successfully returned to work part time and then full time about a year after I quit that job  but I once again find myself working a part time job and hoping for a full time job   Today  I was planning on going out and applying to several retail places near me for work  but I'm finding myself glued to my house   I've worked in laboratory testing and never in customer service of any kind  largely because most of my work issues stem from social interactions   I gave myself until the end of the year to find something in my field before I resorted to customer service   retail type positions  so here I am   I've been feeling a lot of fear today   scared of being yelled at or berated by customers  of breaking down crying at work as I've done at every job I've had at least once  of having more panic attacks   In the long run  the next 6 months won't matter that much because I'm going back for a Master's degree in the fall  woohoo   Nervous and excited    I'd just like to earn as much as I can in the meantime  and I'm completely discouraged after filling out so many online job applications for the last couple of months   I'm very fortunate that I'm independently wealthy and live in my father's home  so I don't have the paying the bills anxiety that you have  although I do sincerely worry about money a lot  particularly due to how difficult securing a decent paying job is and how significantly a bad workplace can affect my mental health   The master's degree I'm going for is in a very hot field right now  Statistics   so I'm hoping to have a lot more employment options once I go through that program   I deal with this anxiety by taking an SSRI  seeing a psychologist  meditating  exercising  getting a kitten  and eating well   I've been slacking a bit on the meditating and exercising lately   I'm seeing my psychologist in a couple hours  so I can tell him about how I failed today and just try again tomorrow   Just taking things one day at a time   Hope you find some peace from your anxieties 
I went through this too  I was 26 and had only dated one person   You should be extremely grateful to be going through this pain  It forces you to be independent and figure out who you are as a person   It sucked balls for me  some nights I'de go to bed and cry but you know it's all part of the learning process    Plus  relationships are not all what you would want them to be  After 4 years of being single and going to bed every night wishing somebody was next to me I finally started dating someone new  After a while I just wanted my free time again and I broke up with her  We want want we don't have right   
I'm on sert 100 mg  i think it helps  It gives me low bp though  Just yesterday slept for 13 hours
Lol  Yes  I've been in the same situation but for me it was kind of a reassurance over me doubting whether I have OCD or not  In other words  I looked up types of OCD and as soon as I stumbled upon HOCD  I started doubting my sexuality  It was never as bad as yours BUT occasionally after masturbation I do perform a minor HOCD related ritual in order to make sure that I'm still crazy about women  This ritual is actual HOCD fear not a reassurance thing like the one I mentioned in the beginning         I'm a virgin  as well  so that might be a major factor contributing to the problem                     I know I can't give you direct help but keep in mind that you just found someone who occasionally experiences HOCD and yes  what you're describing is a symptom of HOCD  Definitely  Also  not liking men as much as before is a kind of a side effect from the psychological crap that you're going through now  I onced experienced existential OCD and faced derealisation in the end because of the anxiety I put myself through  It'll fade away  Be patient and don't overthink it  Hope I helped   
I agree with everything you just said  I have 2 furry boys   
Well  no one can diagnose your father here  However  his behavior does seem similar to certain personality disorders  The only thing that would really help in this case is for your father to see a psychologist  But given your fathers behavior I doubt he would be easily willing   Is there any way you can go to a psychologist  For one thing  a father being absent can have a great effect on you  And as such you may even have problems you aren't even aware of  A psychologist would also be way better equiped to give advice on these matters    Regardless  connecting with empathy can usually help anyone going through issues like this  although it will not solve them  Have you ever watched  this  https   www youtube com watch v 1Evwgu369Jw  video 
Hi there  It sounds like you have a lot of things on your plate right now with your family  I'm sorry that's so hard  But it also sounds like you have a lot of great things as well  which is awesome  Starting medication is a huge step in the right direction  so WELL DONE YOU  Unfortunately  from my experience  new medication can absolutely exacerbate issues for anywhere from 4 8 weeks  You sound like a really strong person  Try to take one thing at a time  What also helped me when I've started or switched meds was reminding myself that my feeling so shitty wouldn't last  that the meds will eventually "even out " Hang in there  I'm here if you want to talk 
Best of luck  Generally you won't feel much better  except placebo  for about two weeks  And the first one you take might not work  I hope you get lucky and this is the one for you though    
After my ex and I broke up I sat down and wrote out every quality I needed from a partner  Some things were top priority while others would just be a bonus  I told myself that if those qualities weren't there then the relationship wouldn't last  You have to make sure your needs are being met    To give you some ideas  I wrote down things like "treats family well " Of course there are exceptions if the family is toxic but generally how they speak to their parents siblings is telling of how they'll treat you later on  Another important one for me was the ability to talk about science and philosophy in depth  I  need  someone with the same passion for learning as I have  I love to bounce ideas off of other people and hear different view points  But I also need someone who thinks farts are hilarious  too   Think about what's important to you  What do you desire out of a relationship  Write it down  don't settle for less when it comes to top priorities  Don't think about the qualities of your friend while doing this  just write what you want  It will help you determine if you should act on your feelings   Please know that it's possible to have a relationship when you have anxiety  My boyfriend of 5 years has panic attacks and GAD while I have ADHD  GAD and MDD  We're one of the happiest couples I know   So  I'd suggest digging deep and determining whether or not you'd have a fulfilling relationship  Then  wait a bit and see if you still have feelings for her    Obviously anxiety is impacting your social life so you should be doing things to aid in that if you aren't already  It sucks to have one person as your only support    I'm like you in that I'm distant in some regards  I'm much better now but I still find it difficult to be close with people  Aside from my boyfriend  I only have like three people I'm close with  Building up just one or two more relationships would help you immensely in regards of the fear of losing your best friend 
Lol before you can even have a go at me  i think i would punch my face off first for ever saying that to someone 
I've printed this off an put it above my bed  Your words are so kind  Thank you so much  It's people like you that save my life every day
Would you like advice  or did you just need to vent  
any small things that give you happiness  just small things
That sounds horrible  But it's good to know that I'm not going crazy

Omg I'm currently watching the show  It's helping me distract myself a bit 
It wasn't even a presentation  It was literally a 30 second update  I thought I could handle it but once I start talking I just immediately choked up  I've been fine before but don't know why I just totally bombed it  It's been that way recently and hoping to find some exercises to help  I saw some websites online but it's  99 a month for one on one coaching  Has anyone tried this   Thank you for replying to my post  
I think Ativan is still one we haven't tried yet  I see my doc on thursday so I'll ask  Thank you 
It's hard to say  He might just be really lazy and not in charge of his life  a personality thing  If you find he has times when he just lazes around and doesn't do much or eat well  doesn't take care of himself  and then times when he has a lot more energy  maybe cheats on your mom during that time  gets very angry and is impulsive  you might consider bipolar  Then again  I have bipolar so I tend to see those symptoms when they might mean nothing   If all those things sort of occur together  I'd say it's just how he is  but I'm by no means a professional  Sometimes people don't take care of themselves or behave well and it's caused by a disorder  Other times it is their own fault 
Thank you so much  I take medication for the depression but sometimes it is not enough to stop the pain  For you to recognise the effort it takes to carry on for so long is so so comforting  I'm so grateful to you
I did the same thing today  I told my grandparents last night I was feeling severely depressed over the holidays and I still hadn't recovered  They flipped their shit  took my possessions from me and told me I was doing it all for attention and they were going to get rid of me    Oh  how much I love living  ' 
I meant YOU would have better luck posting in a relationship forum since  from what I can tell  this doesn't really have much to do with social anxiety  So you likely won't get many responses here  More detail would help if you do decide to post there  Kudos to you for trying to help out a friend  
I am at a complete dead end  School's finished but no idea what I want to do  Studying business law right now and hating everything and everyone there  My parents don't understand my lack of motivation and simply get angry  I'm in no relationship and I can only open up to my friends when we're all drunk as they brush my problems off and say 'Just study something you like'  they don't want to help me 
I have a 30kg vest too and I know what you mean  I only put the full weight in it when I am wearing it for press ups and things like that  It just becomes too awkward otherwise    It doesn't look wearing mine out in public really    It looks suspiciously like a suicide bomber vest
Alrighty then  
I know how difficult perfectionism is as I experience it every day                      I'd say the best way would be to just forget about it  save it and keep it away until the day you'll apply with it  I know that this sounds like a stupid or meaningless suggestion but trust me  anything else leads to huge procrastination  You'll constanly feel the need to change every little detail              Also  why not give it to somebody else who's good at writing them  anyway  So  you won't only avoid bothering to make it perfect but also find time to relax knowing that somebody highly experienced has already prepared it for you way before the deadline 
I'm so sorry this happened to you  It's so wrong what they did to you  You are incredibly strong   First off  I am super impressed by your boyfriend  It sounds like you two have a really healthy   trusting relationship  It's great to hear that you are able to talk to him about these issues and that he listens and is kind and willing to adapt to help you feel safe  That's just incredible    Are you suggesting that your discomfort in being a bottom stems from your assault  Or perhaps it's just not your thing  just like it's not your boyfriend's thing to be on bottom  Just a thought I had  I know you want to please your boyfriend sexually  but would being on bottom make you happy  too  It's okay not to want to do the things he wants you to do    Other than that  I'm not sure I can help you much  It may just take more time   more communication to feel comfortable and avoid flashbacks  Try not to rush it if you can  Baby steps     
It's quite common that we only notice problems with compulsions when they get in the way of something we want  At that moment  it's like being in the middle of a 5K race and noticing you're out of breath  that you don't have the ability to continue the race  Your legs hurt and your lungs ache  The opportunity to build the ability to run the race was in the months and weeks before the race    So in situations like this  I find it useful to separate things like getting the resume completed from dealing with the anxiety  Learning the skills to handle anxiety is like building cardiovascular fitness  it's a long term practice    Getting the resume done is something you can do now  like finishing a race  but it'll be intense  It can help to make space for those intense feelings and expect them to be there  You can choose to feel them and not react to them  Feel panicked after writing a sentence and then write the next and welcome all of the anxious thoughts your brain throws at you  They're like sweat when running  it'd be weird if they weren't there  What matters is taking one step and then another    Another option is to hire a resume writer to finish the race for you and take this as a useful lesson that you need to start preparing for the next race by cutting out compulsions and learning to handle the stuff in your head before you're in need of those skills   Good luck with the application

Dude  if you want someone to talk to  I'm always at my PC when I'm not at school   PM me dude 
I feel you  I am in a very similar situation  What I am trying to think of right now is that there's ALWAYS another option  You don't have to do something you feel completely overwhelmed by 
Right  I know there's some stigma surrounding using the word 'trigger'  but some people do have actual triggers  mine being being in the same room as a man who abused me and my sisters  
I finally made an appointment with a therapist  I start on the 25th

I hope you feel better soon  I feel very alone also  If you are able to get some professional help  that can actually help but it doesn't get you any real friends  For that you need extracurricular activities like hobbies  clubs a hangout  volunteer work  etc where you can meet potential friends and connect  Although it isnt a bad thing to make internet friends also  I am 53  I have very little family I live in my senile mother's house  I love her but she is almost deaf and pretty senile  I hate living here  I am not sure how to encourage you when I am struggling myself but the good news is that I am better than I have been previously so I know there are effective means of treatment  I send you hugs and encouragement and love  My name is Eileen 
Yes  My anxiety takes such a huge toll on me while at work  Exactly why i had to quit  I was being over worked and held to so many responsibility's that i couldn't handle alone  On top of that being one of the only few females around spiked my anxiety more because i felt like and im sure i was being watched constantly  I feel like i cant have a regular clocking in job anymore    Im trying to work from home but i still have trouble  I cant get my focus on my work cuz i worry about 100 other things  Im trying to quit smoking but i feel anxious at times because i know it helps me feel more calm    But also doesn't get me to be as super productive as i want to be  I feel like anxiety digs a huge hole in me that i don't know how to fill and i wish i could  
Best of luck  friend   Small victories 
Holding onto anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent to throw it at your enemy  You are the one who gets burned    You've been holding onto that phone call for over a decade and it's hurt you emotionally  physically  and mentally    I agree that you deserve to a have a happy life but I'm confused as to why it hasn't happened yet  Are you expecting other people to make your life a good one 
thank you  it felt good   
     White supremacy neo Naziism "alt right" is also a form of identity and racial politics   Dude  Yes  Almost all these articles are written by white dudes  which makes the few written by   still men   non white man easy for center to right people to point to and say "he agrees with me" frustrating   and it's frustrating that the people who share these articles  again  men  don't seem to see that they're breakthrough is just an affirmation of the thing most people were already doing  and it's the thing that's easiest for white people to do  I mean  I'm white  and male  and it seems to painfully obvious that this is borne out of doing what's easiest  It's also throwing POC and immigrants and all the people the left claims to care about under the bus  defending you has become a political liability  so    good luck    Like  I agree that maybe not all racism needs dealt with the same way  The guy who tattoos swastikas on his forehead and burns crosses is not the same as the guy who thinks  "they just need to pull their pants up " and one of those guys might be talked out of his views  or the guy that thinks BLM is a "terrorist organization" might be able to be corrected  but if we refuse to talk about "identity politics " the pants guy and the BLM guy will only have their views reinforced or go unchallenged   And you hit it too  all politics are identity politics  all politics are personal  No one bans gay marriage or passes it because it's a nebulous idea  like the interest rate  something that we don't get to vote on  because it's not political  because it's not personal   it gets passed because it matters a whole lot to you  or it gets banned because it's deeply threatening on some level    In terms of moving forward  because as much as people hated Clinton  she would have probably been a better choice for people who voted Trump simply because they need a job  there does have to be some outreach  I think  I don't even know how to go about it  because historically white people have been all about moving minority rights forward until it rubs up against the boundary of other white people  and I balk at the idea of expecting  for example  a scared brown person "go make friends with a racist" for the sake of progress  There's a quote I can't find from Malcolm X telling his followers to ask white people what they thought of a particular guy from the Civil War  this guy fought for the Confederate  had a change of heart part way through  and then worked to free slaves specifically  but he had a very brutal life characterized by the slaughter of a score of white slave holders  Malcolm's point was that white people are all on board with civil rights    until they realize they might have to oppose other white people  and I think this "identity politics" backlash is a reflection of that 
Me too actually  I'm 23 and have never had a boyfriend  I went on a date for the first time a couple months ago  I was into the guy at first but when I had another depression episode a while later  I convinced myself that I should never share this burden with another human being  Idk  I just want a friend who I can cuddle with  And accept me and my depression  But I know my depression would suffocate my partner and I'd feel guilty for that  
Glad you're planning to find a more considerate doctor  hopefully one who will address what you're trying to say rather than critiquing your terminology   
Hey  I'm really sorry you feel that way  I hate school too  I can pretty relate
Have you tried rationalizing with yourself  You're very young and healthy  getting sick would be nothing more than a mild inconvience for you  in fact it would end up making you stronger as getting sick helps strengthen your immune system to make it fight germs better     
You are 28  Your partying and slooting it up days are over  People change and you're getting older  Its fine to slow down and become an adult  If I were you  I would quit weed  It makes people lazy  and if you are an adult you can not be lazy  Get some dating apps  they are the single adults best friend  Just remember its okay to not be the same person as you were in your early youth  
Same  Exactly the same

Hmm that's true 
It's not your fault but thanks for helping 
Hello all   I've had a few minor anxiety attacks over the past few years  Never had an almost constant level of anxiety until I started my new job a few months ago  Previously I was responsible for my own success and answered for myself only  Now I've moved up and rely on others to do the work and answer for their mistakes  It's nerve racking and despite my bosses telling me how well I'm doing I'm constantly anxious depressed  I've made an appointment to see a therapist so hopefully that helps 
Maybe he picked something up or just has a more sensitive stomach than you do  But just remember to make sure he bleaches the entire bathroom and make sure you wash hands before you touch food or your face  You can't catch it if he wasn't showing symptoms so when you were together the entire weekend you weren't exposed to diarrhea or vomit so your fine but now that he is showing symptoms just be careful with your hygiene  If it's from food no need to worry  If he feels like total shit then stay safe with bleach and wash wash wash your hands 
You're right  but the complication currently is that the guy that the extremists are latching onto isn't doing a whole lot to distance himself  He's had some pretty open ended vague rejections  but they're pretty milquetoast  And having the president align  on some level  with your ideals  it gives you more credence than if some asshole talk show host agrees with you    And I agree that he looks like undiagnosed something  I think there's pretty convincing documentation out there that a lot of history's leaders have undiagnosed something  There's a book written about all our presidents that have had something diagnosable and kept it hush hush 
Adding to my spotify now  thanks so much for the recommendation   
It reasuring to hear someone say that  Thank you 
Thank you for making me smile  much love and hugs
On 100mg too  Barely get more than 5 hours of sleep and get the weirdest dreams too  But that maybe because I'm also taking other medications too  Some things help others differently I suppose
Thank you  I try but then I think of how miserable it is and it just all goes out the window  I fixate too much on the physical feelings and can't get past the rest  
I don't have a good math tutor too     
Girl  you can do this  Believe in yourself  no matter how hard it may be  Focus on one goal at a time  you need money  period  Go to the interview  you never know  it might be a life changing moment  Take deep breaths  think about what makes you happy  No matter what the outcome is  if you get the job or not  you'll be one step closer defeating your anxiety  which in itself is a HUGE accomplishment  Remember  I believe in you  you believe in you  GOOD LUCK   3
Don't be so hard on yourself  Everyone deals with anxiety in different ways and  I agree  it's not easy  It requires a ton of work and support which isn't easy when you're anxious and feel isolated    I get cut off a lot too  even by my bf  It's sometimes because I'm trailing or not making a point but a lot of times people get swept up in conversations and just have to get their thought because they think it's more important than what you're saying  Humans are all about the power dynamics and I'm a pretty meek person naturally  I have worked a lot on being strong and independent by meditating  thinking before speaking  and dealing with feelings of inadequacy and anxiety    Another vapid quote which may ring true in getting respect   If you don't respect yourself    I'm a joke     hopeless    Insignificant    No one will learn to respect you  
Thank you so much  It's nice to feel like I'm not alone 
In a way that is how video games help me  When I've shot an alien or beastie  it's like the feeling of popping bubble wrap  Pop  pop  pop  run  pop  Very satisfying and keeps my hands busy

Congrats on becoming sober   Anxiety can come out of nowhere with no known cause   I've been dealing with it for my entire life  and at times it peaks   What I can tell you is that right now you are probably at a peak  and eventually it will subside   You will feel normal again   It's hard to realize in the moment   I myself am also at a peak in my anxiety   Like you  I'm here to get advice   Sometimes even if you can't find a solution  talking about it helps   There probably is a cause to your anxiety that you haven't identified yet   I have been reading a book called the anxiety and phobia workbook which helped me to identify some of the things that cause me anxiety   I hope that you are able to identify whatever is triggering your anxiety  and that you will keep is mind that things will get better   Give it time   
Sending hugs to you OP  I wish for speedy retrieval of the criminal scum  They need severe punishment  
Thank you Eileen  It is comforting to know that others are struggling too  makes the world seem less lonely  My name is Josh  and i'm very grateful for your supportive words

Psychiatrist tried switching meds  seemed to only make my mood worse  As for dosage increases  originally I was taking 20 mg  Was upped to 40 mg and then again to 60 mg where it currently is  I also was given adderall for a while  and we concluded that it didn't seem to change anything whatsoever 
When I tried Viibryd I went up slower than the introductory packet suggested to avoid the digestive problems it's known for  That worked  Unfortunately the Viibryd effect  and it was good  only lasted for 3 months  That was the end of that 
I am actually content with my low entry jobs  I like not having to be so responsible  I'm a care aide  and a cashier  It's the bottom rung on the nurses spectrum and I'm happy to wipe butts  I don't have to deal with all the technical stuff  life altering decisions  and full fledged responsibilities    Thank you for sharing that page you linked  it was a like psych profile of me  I never heard the term 'self esteem attack' and now I have a word for all those terrible moments of panic that weren't really related to anxiety  It resonated a lot with me  I had the unfortunate luck to have to deal with all those problems without knowing what they were or meant    Don't beat yourself up though  It's something that page doesn't really include  I am brutal with myself  I have said things to myself that I wouldn't say to my worst enemy  I'm a learning to be more compassionate and gentle to myself  Try to forgive yourself for failing and try again but this time with a gentle approach to academia and yourself    
Im a 20 year old guy and have been struggling with bad health anxiety for about 5 years due to chronic pain and ringing in my ears  Doctors didn't know what was causing it so I started to assume the worse  I began to start having panic attacks and develop new symptoms in what I now suspect is a psychosomatic disorder  basically where you imagine symptoms but genuinely feel them   I had self diagnosed myself with MS  then moved on to cancer  then brain tumour  then diabetes  then schizophrenia  pretty much anything I could think of manifested itself with actual symptoms  It was terrifying as I would look up my symptoms and then see Disease X  and then experience all the other symptoms I read about leading me to believe I had the condition  You've just got to be aware when you're panicking that you have already identified the fact you have this compulsive worry and that you're most likely not sick at all  But if you get overly worried  the best way to alleviate that is to just go to the doctors and get them to verify that you're fine  I still get symptoms to this day  go in at least once a month  and they give me the all clear  As long as they're reasonable doctors they should be understanding  But maybe consider talking to a therapist or something about the anxiety as I got caught in a terrible loop and started getting panic attacks constantly  and that can cause weird symptoms and make you worry even more  I think I'm dying at some point at least once a week when I'm having a panic attack  It's hard to believe I could be so irrational in hindsight but that is how anxiety can manipulate your mind so it's important to see that as the root of your problem  I find this fear of illness I have is now very manageable if that's any encouragement  Everyone will worry about their health to a certain extent and that is normal  All the best 
I wrote at length about it  here  https   www reddit com r BipolarReddit comments 3vonfd marijuana cxpgdkh   and  here  https   www reddit com r BipolarReddit comments 3wwp7l weed and meds cxzrsmv    but my relationship with it's changed since then  I guess a super condensed TL DR of those comments is  weed helps my depression but can make me psychotic   Since then I've come to realize that the more I smoke it the lower my motivation becomes and the harder it gets to cope with stress without chemicals  But it definitely makes me euphoric  fantastic thing  and gets me to eat  problematic thing given my propensity for overeating   Food tasting amazing  unbelievably good orgasms  satisfying sleep  and a reprieve from dark thoughts makes it ideal for getting me out of a crisis  But I also abuse substances and overuse them  so it's definitely contributed to the 10lbs I'd gained since mid december   I recently learned that while it's gotten me out of suicidal depression  it had also caused psychosis that I thought was someone else's fault  That someone else had shared their super potent weed induced psychosis  but what I think had actually happened was that I'd hallucinated that  too  So whether the guy hypnotized me to believe it or I hallucinated him doing that  weed's at fault  And that psychosis is behind every time I've been inpatient and at least half of my suicidal episodes   It can make us manic  and with heavy use it tends to bring on depression  although the causality on that is still being investigated    For me  I use it to relax and escape depression  I also prefer it to alcohol  because alcohol makes me depressed but weed leaves me feeling better for awhile  My biggest issues with weed right now are the legal status and implications for employment  I'm on the job market   It still induces some psychotic symptoms if I'm careless  but I've got them extremely well controlled and am no longer afraid of them  I figure any significant changes to my beliefs I'd consider while I'm high need extreme circumspection  and I'm already able to identify and largely dismiss the hallucinations that made it dangerous in the past     TL DR  Weed is      nuanced       It's dangerous  but also lifesaving     PS  redditors   can we not  downvote every discussion about weed  Seriously  this shit has gotten old  It disappoints me that what's probably my most upvoted submission to BPR is about how weed causes psychosis  yes  it does  but every time anyone asks questions about it  where you'd have the opportunity to say it yourself   you guys downvote rather than have an actual dialogue about why you think it's bad  Downvoting silences discussion and keeps people from having conversations where you can tell them why you think it's a bad idea  Dialogue is how people grow  not downvotes 
Listen to a podcast  I love listening to podcasts and the radio when I'm really uninterested in doing anything  It feels like I am part of the conversation and I don't feel as lonely 
I'm glad you went to the doctor  that was a really important step  You could even try to get a counsellor or therapist  I don't know where you're from but here in Canada we can usually get that stuff covered by our health care system   Your life won't always be like this OP  It'll come in waves  and it will be something you'll always deal with  but you will have times of peace  I guarantee that  
Seems like to me you've already risen above some of your demons  The sort of things you described from your child hood experiences destroys most people and you seem to have risen above it  You've proved that you're a strong person and that you can rise above some of the immediate issues that are now heavily weighing on your mental health  How are you a terrible mother 
is a path  i was in treatment for almost a year and leaving them was difficult  but i managed with the support of my family and friends   i had a crisis 2 years ago  but i managed without drugs  i hope this experience helps you   The drugs are not the end of the road but small tools within a system
I had a coworker come into the break room on a day that I was extremely stressed  She saw me trying to hold back tears  and failing  and asked me if I was okay  I burst into tears and said no  She asked me what was wrong and I told her that everything in my personal life was stressful  She told me that she'd be there if I wanted to talk more  I finished crying and felt so much better  I wasn't okay  but I was better   I thanked her the next day  It's so strange to see so many people who care  They care and show it and it's wonderful  
This is so crazy  I've had work anxiety on and off for the past few years and today I decided to see if Reddit had anyone experiencing the same problem  I don't necessarily have a high stress job   I work at a doctors office and it is pretty slow most of the time  I guess I have enough time to think and "freak out"  For some reason I feel like I need to run away and can't work today for whatever reason  My anxiety ranges from mild to panicky depending on the day   I try to distract myself and practice deep breathing techniques but some days this doesn't cut it 
Yep  This x100  But  I actually in someways appreciate it  I have ADHD and  like most ADHDer's I can hyperfocus on boring tasks when it's down to the wire and there are severe consequences  I was a huge procrastinator  but I almost always got it done because I didn't want to let my parents and teachers down  I knew they saw me as a good kid  Fast forward to college when I was a faceless student in a lecture hall and only I know my grades  Needless to say they plummeted  The adrenaline I needed to focus came from the way overblown social anxiety  not the more legitimate fear of bad grades  Given that a lot of people with ADHD also suffer from social anxiety  it makes you wonder how much we could help by not treating them like dumb kids as so often is the case  If they know that you truly see them as smart and capable the consequences of letting you down may be enough to help them focus  Of course  this could backfire badly if you're expectations exceed their capabilities  I've been there too and it is crippling   Anyway sorry to go on a tangent  But yes  in general  I rely on that to keep me accountable but I imagine if I'd didnt have ADHD and were reasonably competent with executive functioning I may not appreciate it as much 
Lost my sister 11 years ago and the one thing I regret is not talking that much about it with my family  They are going through the same thing as you  They are one of the few people that will understand  I am sorry your loss  Best of thoughts to you and your family and everyone who stod her close
Thanks  
I am so confused but maybe it's the best option  Why stay on a med that makes you paranoid anxious if you already deal with anxiety  Did you discuss this side effect with your doctor   Any changes you make you have to talk to the doctor first  Ask them to help treat the underlying anxiety and obsessive thinking you feel  
When in doubt  just sleep it away  Not like stressing over nothing will lead anywhere 
What the fuck They held you down and forced it on you after getting you drunk enough to be unable to fight back  Go to the hospital  file a police report  and report it to your school administration  
I feel like I have known you  even though I don't know you   I'm 47 and when I was in college  I belonged to a RPG fantasy scifi etc club   I knew a lot of guys who were quite introverted  and what you describe about yourself sounds like you are too and that's not a bad thing   So this would make it more difficult and more frustrating and quite possibly less rewarding for you to socialize than it might be for others   Just guessing bounce these words inside your head and see how they sound   I also want to point out something not directly related to depression  but another mental illness   When I was thirty  I moved and had to get a new psychiatrist  have been seeing them since adolescence  long history of depression    When I told him my life story  one thing stuck out   I told him that for most of my childhood  I often felt bored   Long story short  sometimes  when some people use the word "bored" when describing social settings or life in general  it cooouuuld be  very tentative  not projecting  don't jump the gun   that the person is suffering from undiagnosed ADD   Mind you  not the hyperactive part  but the just the deficit part    So  when you couple someone who is naturally introverted with a touch of ADD  you get a person who WANTS all the pleasures of social interaction and WANTS to be involved in the dating game BUT said person also gets frustrated quickly  that's an ADD trait  and finds that the pleasures they can find on their own are easier to come by yet wholy different from the pleasure of social and dating things   As far as depression goes  your words don't suggest that to me  but maybe someone else can offer better insight   Good luck either way 
Absolutely it can be useful to tackle that as part of all the other OCD crap    You only have one brain so it can be useful to approach all symptoms as one big pile of mental health 
I'm very sorry that you have experienced such abuse as a child   Since your brain was not developed enough to process what you were experiencing memories of your abuse may have been repressed  The brain will do this in order to protect itself    Sexual assault rape are about taking power and control away from another person  It is not uncommon for survivors to recreate sexual experiences in order to attempt to be in control of the situation  This helps to explain your need to find older men who you wanted to hurt you sexually  You were trying to create situations where you might have the opportunity to regain a feeling of power and control over your body    I suggest that you look for a trauma therapist to consult with about your experiences  Someone who has training in this area will be able to help you understand your choices  properly process the memories in a safe environment and guide you towards healing and recovery  If you live in the U S  the RAINN website can direct you to a therapist in your area  with no fee for services   Or you could search online for a trauma therapist in your community or call a support line to ask about available resources  RAINN and pandys org offer online forums as well as other information   You are not alone and there are professionals who can help you when you are ready  Keep reaching out for support  You may also find help in the sub rape counselling   Take good care of yourself

Thank you  yesterday was one of  those  days and I needed to hear that I'm still young and have plenty of time to do whatever I want in life       I met with my therapist this morning and actually did mention that some of the exercises seem bogus and like I'm trying too hard  He basically assured me that not every exercise is for everyone and that we'd eventually find one that worked  for me  
I might be totally wrong here  but I was under the impression that these things spread when someone v's or has d and doesn't clean themselves or their surroundings properly    Either way I think you'll be fine since you said your kiss was 24 hours before  
i only buy online which is what makes it so hard  its easily accessible and always there when i feel anxious or my day is getting bad  
I do not  The police told me two months ago I should be contacted by one but I haven't yet  They havent been the best at    Well  being helpful      Thank you so much  though  it means a lot to me 
That stomach pain sounds serious  I'm sorry you're in so much pain  Alcohol is an anaesthetic so it does numb pain    I don't know how to help but I think you should give yourself some love  I read so much self hate  I had a lot of self hate and experienced the same wild anger and frustration  Not knowing why I felt like that until I was much older  I still don't like myself very much but learning to stop hating myself really helped me deal with anger towards myself  I used to like going for long walks just to do nothing  think about nothing because I had that same feeling of not being able to deal with my own existence  Nowadays I tend to browse online shopping and play Candy Crush when I just can't deal  It's mindless fun  
I want to hug you just so you can hug me back  Same issue same boat  Another year of no health insurance 
That's pretty unsupportive advice  I get that it may not have worked for you  but that's not the case for everyone  OP took a big step today  and that's really important   There are limitless options when I comes to healing  and it's not going to be one size fits all

Be patient   You may feel worse the first week  but then it will most likely get a lot better  Best of luck

Hey I had my first panic attack in June 2016 as well  a few days before my 20th birthday  I won't go into a ton of detail but it's been up and down  I quit my job  took a break from school  found a great psychiatrist and psychologist  have been held back by anxiety a lot  stayed in a mental hospital a few days  and have learned a lot about mental illness  To be honest if there is a silver lining it's that now I want to get better and be able to help others dealing with the same thing  and to eliminate the stigma    My best advice for you or anyone is 1  Books and 2  A good psychiatrist who knows what they're doing and can prescribe medication that can help immensely  Keep sharing your progress and good luck

I lost my dad almost the same way 8 years ago except he collapsed from sepsis and died later at the hospital  Never got to see him  say goodbye  etc  Its a shitty  awful thing that hits you out of nowhere  and I feel for you    The only advice I can give you is try not to bottle it up and forget about it  Experience your emotions when they come to you  I felt nothing over my father's death for the whole 8 years up until recently when I had a huge breakdown because I finally realized he was actually gone  I would hate for someone else to go through that    I hope things get better for you    
it's fine no worries   i appreciate your idea tons
You're welcome      I hope things are feeling better right now  And totally  IRL  I've found that more and more friends tend to have anxiety as I've gotten older  And it's been great  because we've all been able to learn from and help each other  And just be patient with each other  
SSRIs do not make you happy  They block negative emotions  that is all
Yes  especially the urgency and awareness that something is off  and not trusting anyone  My bf almost feels like evil to me in those moments   I blurted this all out to him yesterday finally and he was like  what do you need from me  He's always supportive so that isn't really the problem  I just wanna find a way to prevent it from happening  I think I might need a new therapist bc I just don't feel a good connection w mine 
That doesn't matter that much though  you're the only one who can see it and you only use it for logging in 
thank you so much  It's reassuring to here that it's normal to feel those things as i often feel like something is wrong 
All I can really say is that it affects some people really really badly  I have witnessed this in multiple close friends  
Sometimes they can get super busy  especially if they are under staffed or rely on volunteers  Or maybe the police failed to let the advocates know that you wanted their services  Or maybe the police officer who told you that didn't know how the process works    I do court advocacy  and I know we aren't allowed to reach out to people  They have to seek services from us instead  They have to let us know that they want our help  So  maybe it's the same in your town   Or  maybe they're just unorganized and not helpful  Which sucks if that's the case  How do you feel about reaching out to the center yourself 
I think  r Gaming4Gamers would be a better place for this 
Yes  it does   I have had it for a few years now   I think I am also depressed   It's hard to tell when you have PTSD because your feelings have a dampener on them after awhile   I can't cry  I think it's because I am always upset over something    That being said  I am doing better  I think   
22 here  and fortunately I've at least experienced kissing twice and that was about it   no relationship though   I feel you OP  I used to get this bad feeling about how pathetic I am for still not experiencing something probably most people my age have and I'm just left in the dark  etc  You have two choices though   1  You can keep on dwelling on how pathetic your life is  how you're a joke  and that things will never get any better which will actually result in that as you go further and further into the vicious circle of self loathing all the time  or    2  You can accept that you have never been in a relationship yet even after reaching age 20 and just continue on living and trying to improve yourself  Remember  there are some people who have it way worse than us   I personally decided to go with  2 and break the vicious circle of beating myself up and started trying to improve myself  Started eating healthier  exercising  trying out new hairstyles  regularly watching YouTube videos on how to improve this and that  Also videos  pictures  quotes  etc  that boost the mood  There's still no relationship yet but we can't give up   Remember  there are some people who have it way worse than us  Apologies for the crappy english 
Congratulations  SSRIs have been life changing for me  but they take a little while to kick in  Give it a month 
Try getting online courses 
That's a lot for just saying how you feel  your grandparents are kinda idiots to do that 
Thank You so much for your reply  I truly appreciate you taking the time and value your advice  Its really good to hear someone tell me I'm just hitting a peak  I try to tell myself that too but it's much more reassuring hearing it from someone else who is going through similar issues  I hope you are able to find inner peace as well 
hey  thanks for reading and responding  Im not bummed about not partying or having to change  My issue stems from some deep seeded narcissism  When I was younger  and still today  I put too much self worth in how I look  I've smoked alot of weed and spent alot of time by myself in the last 8 years  and now when I look in the mirror I see a substance abusing  ugly  soulless  expressionless face  I feel emotionally underdeveloped  especially compared to my peers  which is causing me to feel like damaged goods because I remember how relaxed and easy going I used to be  but now Im trapped inside my own head thinking Im constantly being judged
I can only imagine   
I'm pretty new in learning about CBT   I find journaling the thought process is helpful  I recommend How To Deal With Low Self Esteem by Christine Wilding  I believe there is also a less specific version about CBT as well   I picked this up because everything was very simple and logical  She gives exercises such as keeping a thought catalog to help rewire your thinking  It's really helped me change my course but I still need lots of practice haha

We should be able to quit school whenever we wanted to    Why do we need to learn those fucking insane math problems and stuff like that    Waste of time 
I wonder if CBD oil has the same AchEI action  I was having a hard time understanding some studies because there are so many different cannabinoids chemicals in cannabis  and it might depend on the extraction method used on the CBD oil  
Hey there  sorry you're not feeling to well    I know the holidays exhaust the crap out of people  with the lack of sleep and what not  Alcohol doesn't help anxiety  it dehydrates you and lack of water makes you stress out more    Drink lots of water first of all    You don't need to surrender to your anxiety  you just need to learn not to fear it  to be neutral to it  Kind of like mindfulness  acknowledge it and let it go  I know it's easier said than done    There's a self help book that's really helped me and I'm so grateful for  if you'd like I can lend it to you via kindle  May help you out on your trip  
If they are really your friend  I'm sure it will be 
Well lets just talk man  Do you have a job  Parents  siblings  
I'm impressed with all your sustained efforts       Have you tried Neurofeedback      Maybe the part of your brain responsible for motivation isn't as active as it should be  They'll be able to tell when they map your brain and help you uptrain it if necessary      I've been doing NF myself since September and it has tremendously improved my PTSD   anxiety  I've just moved on to the next brain spot which deals with motivation and it's going well      The downside of NF is its price  it's cost prohibitive for many      I first heard about Neurofeedback back in 2006 from a fellow research assistant  She was using it for depression  although it couldve been non brain biofeedback   TBH I just wrote it off as hippie dippiest nonsense at the time   Privately to myself  not out loud to her   The next time I heard about neurofeedback was last January when my physician recommended it  I still was resistant skeptical about it but I finally came around in September  I go to two treatment sessions a week and have seen great results   So have my husband and kids   I really wish I with more open to it back in 2006 or even this past January     Feel free to PM me if you want me to share more details  Actually that's exactly what I did when I was trying to learn more about it  I asked another Redditor

is there something you'd rather do  than isolate yourself   I'm fucking great at isolation  I'll stay in my room all day  I'll eat animal crackers and drink water from the bathroom sink if I think that would spare me pain or social awkwardness  But after a couple days doing that I'm so drained that I have to make myself do something  talk to someone  even if its a stranger  force myself to run  go outside   Not because I feel like it but because I NEED to feel alive again  for my own self  I dunno  it makes me sad to know you are isolating yourself  and you believe thats the only way 
Do you got a Discord or anything like that  Even if you don't regularly use it  it'd be nice to have  especially since MinerAp has a channel now  Plus its my most used way of communication 
Yeah but it's cool    You can still PM me whenever x 
Have you tried switching doctors and advising them of your self harm  Have they provided you any alternative options 
What a good idea  I also enjoy very structured video games  Prison Architect  Civ  where I end up doing nearly the same thing every time I play  but there are enough changes that it feels interesting  Or sorting organizing things  
Those are all the symptoms of a panic attack  Every one you just described    I know it's scary having panic attacks  I developed health anxiety because of them  What made me feel better was going to the doctor for an evaluation to ensure me that there was nothing physically wrong with me  Don't be afraid to get a second opinion  At least then you know to rule out any health issues and know that it's your panic attacks    Remind yourself this is how you usually feel when you're having a panic attack every time you start to feel those sensations  They are familiar sensations

It is too bad that depression and suicide are so taboo on TV  It would be a wonderful medium to explore these issues that literally everyone deals with  Like when kids shows deal with heavy stuff like pets dying or divorce

Unfortunately I don't have it with me right now but I can try to look it up   The title is super generic like "dialectical workbook for anxiety "
8 years to get diagnosed  It was't difficult for me at all  I told my doctor I thought I had bipolar  he asked me a ton of questions  then agreed with me  That seems strange to me  I guess it would depend on the doctor 
No he hasn't made an attempt to contact me  The last time we had contact I had told him that I wasn't going to sext him and that if all I was good for to him was sex and nudes that he could just stop contacting me  He said fine  and that he was done with me even though he wasn't using me  surprise  he didn't offer an explanation as to what he really is doing if he isn't using me after being confronted about it for the millionth time  
Goodluck  They've helped me a lot  Used to cry and feel anxious almost every day but since my doctor got me on mine  I haven't cried since and I can function much better during the days 
Maybe that's a good idea  I just need to quit school 
Sure

They may block all emotions  People may report becoming numb on them  dead inside  dull  like zombies or robots

That is so illegal and not your fault    
A thing that my boyfriend does that I've borrowed is keeping a running list of expected outcomes and actual outcomes  You may not be able  right now  to stop the fear that someone has poisoned your food or your dogs have rabies  But perhaps after a while  if you can look back and see that you were afraid of that and it ended up being untrue  and that has been a consistent pattern over time  you will be able to calm yourself more easily when you have those thoughts    Another of my friends likes to just take the thought and run it to its full course and ask herself what the outcome would be  What would be the worst that happened if you were poisoned or died in your sleep  Being poisoned would suck  hard  But eventually  you'd get better or you'd die  and it would be over  Dying in your sleep would be tragic  But it would affect everyone else and not really you  you know  Depending on your belief system  you might be quietly gone forever  and therefore not suffering  Or you might be happily in the afterlife  and therefore not suffering  Going in your sleep is not a bad way to go    For me  it has been helpful to let go of the idea that one day the anxiety will just completely go away  I don't think  for me  at least  it ever will  and trying for the impossible is setting myself up for disappointment  However  I do believe that for almost everyone  anxiety can become manageable and that managing it shouldn't feel shameful  We don't look down on people with a broken leg for using crutches or with cancer for getting treatment  Don't shame yourself for doing whatever you need to do to manage your anxiety  and don't tell yourself it's hopeless or your a failure if anxiety still pops up  even when you're doing your best  Remember that you're doing your best and that it will get better    Do you mind if I ask what things  in addition to meds  you do to manage your anxiety  
25 mg sertraline  going on my third week  They definitely help but be ready for some insomnia and loss of appetite  at least that's what's been happening for me 
I honestly think moving is such a good idea  I want out  I literally hate my town  my college  the people  My family made one a big decision for me that I wanted to make myself in which college I wanted to attend  I now go to a socially desolate community college where its just like high school  I'm wasting my time here  Parents won't let me transfer and now I've missed out on key years of making friends at college  I may as well throw my remaining years in school in the garbage  Nothing will come out of them  My parents ruined any chance of having a good college experience  I had a horrid high school experience so I thought "hey college must be better " Nah  it's sucked  I legit don't want to live anymore  I haven't had friends in YEARS  These last 6 years have fucked me up and I'd rather kill myself then live through the remaining two years of college    I am medicated and in therapy but nothing is helping  Literally have done nothing but lay in bed and cry for the last week  My comfort zone is fucked so I'll never really ask people for plans  Every time I ask the answer is "sure " I text them and they don't fucking answer  They never contact me  Nobody ever texts me  Nobody ever wants to hangout  Loneliness  past experiences  my small comfort zone and the list goes on  All reasons I frankly just want to die 
Hope so   I might be hyper at the moment for unknown  undiagnosed reasons  and it may be compromising my rather minimally effective judgement    As I contemplate crashing a couple months into the arms of the grim reaper with a sledgehammer  if I don't dare devil myself into a smudge first 
this is great may be i should hv started with this
Have you seen a doctor for your anxiety  But I know how u feel  I had a job interview in the summer and a couples before I was gonna go I bailed out  Mostly because of the questions they'll ask  "Describe yourself"  etc  To me I find it pointless to ask questions like that and also makes me feel uncomfortable haha  But have faith in yourself  You can do anything you put your mind too  literally  All the " I cant's" and the nervousness are your brain telling you to fight or flight  But it's just a job interview  not life or death  It's okay to be nervous too  If you do go  just fake your confidence  Tell yourself you got the job  Good luck 
Ooh I forgot about this  Good point
Thanks I'll definitely look into that  
When I feel like this  I try to look at the track records of the people I'm worried about and see if they come around at other times  when they don't need things  and how they respond when I need things  And if you honestly can't tell  if you have a friend you do consistently trust  perhaps you could ask them for some outside perspective    This stuff is tricky because anxiety does sometimes make us suspicious of people who aren't doing anything wrong  However  being in a situation with people who behave badly can make us think that manipulative behavior is normal or that we don't deserve better  
Hey man  I read a quote somewhere that read  "Suicide isnt getting rid of the pain  its just passing it on to someone else"  You can think back to some time in the past and connect the dots of the path that lead you to where you are at this moment but you cannot connect the dots looking forward  you just gotta believe that they will somehow connect  I know that right now this may seem hard to believe but life is the single most important thing you will ever experience  dont give that up    Hang in there buddy    Theres no shame if you want to talk to someone  here a couple of suicide hotlines for you mate     KidsHelpPhone  1 800 668 6868   National Suicide Prevention  1 800 273 8255   Suicide Prevention Center  1 877 727 4747  
Ya I have a job  I dont want to into much detail for privacy reasons  because there arent too many people that do what I do  but ya Im self employed running a business online  I have unlimited freedom and the pay is pretty good  but Ive lost the passion for my job as well  Its not even something I like talking about anymore  I used to thnk it was a cool job  but it wont last forever and I dont really have a future in this position I have  My job situation is definitely a lingering issue  I have 2 sisters in their twenties who have their own lives doing their own thing with their boyfriends families  Im kinda left with my 2 parents in their early 60s  I dont live at home  but I stop by often to see how they're doing   My dad is the same as me  Hes been battling depression for most of his life  and in the last year 18 months hes been in a really low place as well  My mom smokes a pack a day and drinks wine almost every night  These are things I wish she'd quit  but shes been living this way since she was 18  She tried to live more healthy but she was a nervous wreck and didn't feel like herself so she just fell back into her regular lifestyle  Our family has alot of love in our hearts  but not enough tough love to identify problems and try hard to fix them   My dad never really listened to me as a kid  He would sit and listen  but offered pretty generic advice and not much guidance  For a long time I felt like I couldn't be myself around him becuase he was the man of the house  I dont really know how to explain it but I hope you can understand that   
Great job  You absolutely did the right thing  And thanks for sharing how you handled it  this will make it easier for me to know what to do if I ever find myself in a similar situation  
Welcome to the club  Give it a little time  you'll probably get side effects this week  and good mood effects in a few weeks  so don't stress if it doesn't do anything for your depression right now  just keep taking them on schedule and reevaluate in a month
I don't see what's so unusual or freakish about your situation  to be honest    You met a shitty woman who proceeded to manipulate you and make you suffer    You held onto her words because you were manipulated and suffered a long time because of it    It has shattered your self image and you can only find sexual release through escorts    It's unfortunately a very common thing to be manipulated by people  It's very common to only have sex with escorts because other relationships are too difficult due past hurt and poor self esteem    None of it is hard to believe  It's just a really long series of seriously fucked up events people that led you to where you are now  It doesn't seem highly unusual or freakish to me  People are can be horrible  manipulative  liars  cheaters  and they get away with it while being happy as clams and having loving families and friends  Life is really unfair    It takes a lot of mental training but if you commit you can learn to let these things go  It's not easy but being miserable isn't easy either  it's just familiar    If you need some help or support I would recommend therapy above all and then r relationships  Those guys are harsh critics but they can have some really good insights and support 
  You don't need to surrender to your anxiety  you just need to learn not to fear it  to be neutral to it  Kind of like mindfulness  acknowledge it and let it go   I really like this advice  The key to anxiety is understanding your your triggers  listening to what your body is telling you  and responding appropriately    You can attend but talk to your teacher about your anxiety so that way your teacher understands your needs and can support you  Having an anxiety buddy can also help if you feel comfortable enough confiding in another classmate  And bring things that help you de stress  your favorite pillow  book  earbuds for music  or pre load some shows to your electronic device    When you feel like you need to recharge   let your teacher or anxiety buddy know how you're feeling and that you need space      Drink lots of water first of all    And this  
My advice would be to simplify and try to make your diet more anti inflammatory  For example  buy or grow broccoli sprouts  sulphoraphane  instead of the store supplement  which is less effective  That way you don't have to worry about supplements that could hurt you in the long run  because good quality food couldn't hurt you in the long run
I'd really like to just leave them and never meet them again but I keep running into them  i had to stand behind my ex in a queue for lunch and she was with like 5 mates all giggling and whispering and I was there behind just silently wanting to kill myself  
Nothing wrong with being comfortable with where you are in life  Hell  I love video games and TV  I binge watch so much  
I wish I had something more than a generic response to offer you but man  fuck that bitch  You gotta do what you feel is right for you and try your best to shrug off the things you can't control  I started a great new job in the fall only to quit come winter after finding out the manager was a complete ass clown  I powered through it for as long as I could but at the end of the day it wasn't worth walking on eggshells all the time  and I got another job offer anyway so it was no sweat  If I were you I would take some time to evaluate the pros and cons of the job and make a decision if you want to stay or not  Unfortunately only you can make that decision but I think you will make the right choice  If you love the work and think you can tough it out until you get promoted or she gets fired then by all means go for it  No sense in living a life of regret just because other people get in your way  Good luck  I know you will come out on top of all this

What do you mean  I made a post a couple of weeks ago about me wanting to change because I don't want to be myself anymore  
I'm mid twenties and between the money and the lack of effective treatment  I've just come to embrace what my life is  
I hate how ducking much I depend on my friends   even though I have a few   I wait all day for a text or call and when it doesn't happen I worry they are out having fun with others who actually progress through their lives    I wasn't always like this or maybe I have been like this and just noticing it now 
Buddy i feel you  I come from a messed family too  When it comes to family its the ones who you can count on who matter the most  not the ones who make a negative impact on others  You have a good job too  When you are 28 its not about how fast you can chug beers  Its about how stable you are and about your job  You got one of the two down so just work on the other  Like i said dating apps are your best friend  If you don't meet up with any girl just chat with them  If you fake it for long enough you will start to become what you are trying to be  chat with anyone man  Talk with friends and go to a bar with them  Do not dwell on the past  Especially don't dwell on who you used to be because no one can become who they were back in the day  Literally no one  Everyone changes as they get into adulthood 
Just wanted to echo this  A lot of people prematurely stop ssris because it feels like it's not working  You may have some effects before then but it typically does take a few weeks for the true action to take hold  
100 times no  It is not your fault  
I felt like that a lot in school and it was because I was self sabotaging myself  I would psych myself up and then do absolutely nothing  The method I used to do anything at all was to go really slow  Just write down one sentence and then go get a snack  One more sentence and then watch TV for a bit  Eventually  I would find a good source or have an actual train of thought that would result in a paragraph or two  Don't be so hard on yourself and just write while being out of it    I'm feeling pretty out of it myself right now  I was planning to go to the gym but I've been on the computer for hours and I'm contemplating another cup of tea for the motivation   I know the real motivation won't come though  I just have to shut off the computer  put on my work clothes  and jog to the gym  But that cup of tea is signing its siren song   
I haven't because I can't afford to   which is the whole point of the job  Awful cycle really  Anxiety stops me from working but I need to work to be able to afford to treat it   heh  I'm still really not sure I will be able to get through this yet  but the clock is ticking 
That's what I used to think about myself  Too weird  too neurotic  too fucked up and insecure  I think it's almost never true about a person  though  We all have our good points  and we're all lovable  and that includes you 
You have people who care here     It really helps to connect with other people like on this subreddit     
Understood   SSRIs are just a step that some people take with varying degrees of success  They will probably not single handedly solve someones problems without taking additional steps  or they may not prove helpful at all  but blocking negative emotions can be helpful in taking those next steps   I just think that given the forum we're speaking under  it's important to provide constructive support not just blanket remarks stating something won't work 
Probably  I go through bouts of depression  Usually in 7 8 month sprints and I get it worse in the winter  That's called SAD  how appropriate  
I've wondered this  too  My anxiety always seems to settle down in a crisis  It's like my brain has been expecting this all along and now it has somewhere to direct all that energy  It's when there's nothing big to deal with that my brain starts wondering what the next crisis will be and freaking out  
No  I forgot setting an appointment with the psychiatrist and could only set one up a month ahead  It didn't seem urgent for them so much and I just let it be  I thought I could be fine without them since I was very anxious from living at home with my parents but I've moved to a private apartment since then 
Would you mind at all telling me what form of meditation it is   Some are soooo helpful  others are actually anything but

thanks man  even a simple interaction like this is making me feel better  tbh Im not worried at all about my party life  Ive never been very social unless alcohol is involved  Lately Ive been thinking about how cool it would be to find a nice girl and escape from reality with her  Move away and start a new life away from everything I used to know  The problem here is I feel so insecure and its hard for me to pursue woman without feeling like Im being creepy  especially because I look burnt out now and expressionless  Its a real mess in my head right now  I could literally feel like a god with alot of confidence one hour  Then maybe an hour later I might feel like a piece of shit creepy low life failure who's life has already peaked
This is really interesting and helpful   I like the way youre thinking about it with your axis model   Im wondering how awareness fits in  though   The first time I experienced a delusional manic episode before I was diagnosed  I knew that other people would consider what I was thinking doing crazy  so I lied and hid it and did what I wanted secretly   But it never once crossed my mind that I could be delusional   I just thought that I knew something that other people didnt   I wasnt able to reality test at all because I had no idea I needed to   Now  Im diagnosed and on lithium  which helped me to realize that I was delusional previously  but Im again struggling with some irrational and bizarre thoughts   The difference is that this time  Im completely aware that my ideas could be considered delusions while at the same time believing that they are true   This is a much more confusing situation than when I wasnt aware that my thoughts could possibly be delusions  and Im having constant debates in my head about whether my thoughts are true or not   Im also comparing this to earlier when I had no such debates because I was 100  certain   How do you think awareness of the possibility of delusions factors in 
I don't really know what to do with my life either  I screwed up with school and work resulting in a lot debt and working back as a cashier part time    I'm sure you're still good at things  I messed up but I'm still a great cashier and I'll find permanent work as a care aide soon  We all screw up in our life  It's no reason to be so hard on yourself  Give yourself a break  take some time alone to relax and figure out what to do   Are you still in school  Can you talk to a counsellor about a lighter course load 
Something my boyfriend does that I admire is that he just owns who he is and what he does  And because he just owns it  everyone accepts it  For a lot of my life  I've been a person who is constantly cringing and apologizing for everything I do  feeling like everyone knows that I'm a screw up and is judging me  The thing  though  is that every single person makes mistakes  and stupid ones    How people react to our mistakes is largely determined by how we react to them  If we act like we're stupid  other people will believe us  If we shrug it off or laugh  they generally will  too  Most of becoming a confident person  I think  is being able to act like one  It's okay if it's fake for a while  Just remind yourself that other people have struggles  too  and if anyone is judging you  that's their problem  Practice being okay with yourself 
Problem is that for me  digging deep would entail analyzing things indefinitely and never deciding to do anything  I'd love to just like get a big circle of close friends RIGHT NOW so I could have more social support  and not be so addicted to talking to one person  I'm worried about waiting too long   even though she'd be cool to keep as a platonic friend as well    I have a really vain hope in the back of my mind that she'll hit on me so that I'll be forced to make a decision

You will be ok   it took me a long time to get diagnosed b c my parents interfered  I didn't know my symptoms were characteristic of bipolar  I hid things  etc

thank you  is it normal to feel those things all the time even when im not having a panic attack  it's scary
No problem bro  You gota know that finding a girl like that wont happen over night  It takes so so so much time  but it is worth it  Being able to find someone you would die for is what keeps me going  Maybe if your emotions switch alot could be a sign of some sort of personality switch thing  Im not a doctor but i have no clue  Get out there dude  If you take one thing from this is that you gota fake it until you make it  Good things happen to all that truly want to love 
I often isolate myself during anxiety flare ups  People who don't have anxiety think of it as simply just feeling a bit nervous  I can't be around people who don't understand and say cliché shit like 'stop worrying'  Or worse  the people who get so uncomfortable that they don't know what to say so say nothing   I find isolating myself and using forums such as this to get through the worst is by far the best option for me  I can just lay in bed for hours and not have to answer to anyone or pretend everything is fine   The only person I ever genuinely want to be with when I'm feeling anxiety is my boyfriend  He is such a calming influence on me and so laid back that all my symptoms start to go  It's just a shame we live 80 miles apart and I only see him once a week   Anxiety is isolating in its very nature  so being here  discussing it with like minded people is the best place for you  I hope this offers some comfort xxx
i hope it all goes well for you  good luck

  Like  I agree that maybe not all racism needs dealt with the same way  The guy who tattoos swastikas on his forehead and burns crosses is not the same as the guy who thinks  "they just need to pull their pants up " and one of those guys might be talked out of his views  or the guy that thinks BLM is a "terrorist organization" might be able to be corrected  but if we refuse to talk about "identity politics " the pants guy and the BLM guy will only have their views reinforced or go unchallenged   Yes  From my observations  there are two types of "ignorant"  ignorant but maybe willing to listen  and ignorant and hostile  The first step in these types of situations is to figure out what kind of audience is being approached    It's also throwing POC and immigrants and all the people the left claims to care about under the bus  defending you has become a political liability  so    good luck    I balk at the idea of expecting  for example  a scared brown person "go make friends with a racist" for the sake of progress   I agree  After the election  I questioned my habit of exclusively sticking around people involved in or at least sympathetic to anti racist  anti xenophobic  pro LGBTQ  etc movements until I reminded myself that it's for my own safety  It doesn't make sense for me to willingly put myself in danger for the sake of progress when the whole point of White supremacy  for example  is the idea that my voice is not worth listening to  that my existence in this country is unacceptable  This is why I think White people are important in moving anti racist work forward  Sometimes more privileged allies  White  straight  cis  neurotypical  etc   can be misguided or ill informed or merely part of movements in order to get attention or to collect cultural capital  but I rarely encounter these types of people  All in all  I'm grateful for the people who truly go out of their way to listen to others  examine their own actions and beliefs  and make changes however they can for the sake of peace  Thank you for being kind  especially online where it's so easy to be hostile  It means a lot these days 
When I don't have good friends around in person and am worried I'll rely too much on someone  I look for penpals  There are a lot of cool people out there you can talk to to fill some of your social needs without relying entirely on one person  If you are able to find some additional friends  whether in person or through writing  that might let you get some perspective on how you feel about your best friend and whether you'd like to take things further  It might also be useful to have a journal  just to have a place where you can think things through on your own sometimes   Another thing I've done in the past  because I have been lonely and do fall wildly in love with people very quickly  has been to stop and think about the person I'm having feelings for and determine whether there's anything right now that I'm only putting up with because of the infatuation  If there's anything that you feel like you're tolerating right now that you know will drive you nuts later  that may be an indication not to take things further  If  however  all the things that are problems right now seem like they'd still be manageable and worth dealing with once infatuation wears off and things become more normal  maybe it's worth pursuing   This is the mental check I used before pursuing things with my current boyfriend

Hullo    I completely 100  understand how you feel   I started getting panic attacks as a result of death anxiety at the age of about 9  I'd felt fine for a while but then all of a sudden the holidays hit and I fell back into the hole  I'm 21        It's such a horrible experience  and one that I've only just realised is actually a problem and needs addressing  rather than just a normal way of thinking  My doctor put me on propranolol  which is great for calming down the physical effects of a panic attack   it doesn't do much in terms of calming down the intrusive thoughts  apart from maybe a bit of a placebo effect  I've found myself feeling overall calmer but the thoughts aren't completely gone  but would recommend if you're ok with the idea of medication  There's also the option for SSRI antidepressants  but doctors tend not to prescribe these unless you've tried therapy and counselling too  well that's how it works in the UK at least     Basically  I've found being open about my feelings to particular people to be really helpful   like speaking to medical professionals and university counsellors etc  but I think it is just a case of trial and error  Different behavioural therapies meds general stuff work differently for everyone  it's just a case of working out what that is    Sorry for the long long lost but feel free to message me anytime because this is a really horrible thing and it's nice to know you're not alone sometimes

You sound like you've gone a really far way into recovery  Great job  It just sounds like you're at a plateau  They happen in weight loss and the only thing to get past is to double down on your efforts    I really like yoga  It's very relaxing and a very easy workout  But I can get so discouraged when I see women doing advanced poses on IG effortlessly  I have to remind myself that they are doing this all the time not once in a while like me    I have had such a hard time drinking water  I was raised on milk  pop  and hot chocolate  I hated water  It took a long time but I'm drinking at least 1 2 cups of clear water a day and at least 2 cups of water with those squirty water enhancers like mio

You have an anxious fear of death because no matter what anyone does or says  it's going to happen  I went through a phase like this for about a year  Apparently  it's something that all twenty somethings go through  When they realise their own mortality  they obsess about it for quite some time  I'm 32 now and although the thought of it still scares me  both the process and what happens after it  and the idea of absolute nothingness  and me not existing at all  I've accepted it's going to happen  so I really need to make the most of my time here  Worrying about it ruins that time  It's like worrying about the sun coming up tomorrow morning  It's going to happen and you'll waste every day being miserable about it   I would say that my worrying about death itself has reduced but I worry about things now that could result in death  For example my health and driving in my car  I'm not a risk taker at all for this reason

I get that  For what it's worth  I'm 34 and only now in my first healthy relationship  I had a long term relationship before that  but we were pretty awful to each other  and I left it feeling like I was physically disgusting and emotionally off putting  as well  I mean  why else would my husband be unable to love me and be attracted to me  and my family treat me so unkindly    Honestly  what helped me get over it with dating was just going out and having a string of casual encounters  If people actually wanted to sleep with me  I couldn't be as disgusting as I thought I was    Funnily enough  that's how I met my current boyfriend  One of those encounters ended up being someone I really connected with  who was interesting and fun and just treated me really well  Having someone I was into treat me with respect and kindness helped me to see myself differently    Even before we started dating  though  I had been working on thinking differently about myself  reminding myself that everyone has problems  and mine don't make me any less of a person than anyone else  Taking some time to do things that are just for me  not for anyone else  and working on validating my worth as a person  outside of what anyone else thinks  has also done a lot for me and helped me to be able to not torpedo this relationship through my self doubt and massive insecurity    I guess what I'm trying to say is I know it's hard  But if I can do it  you can  too  Remember that you're a good person and worthwhile  Not every romantic attempt will pan out  and that's not about you  If you feel like looking  eventually you'll find someone  And best of luck

Yep I need to take the time to build great relationships  but it seems so difficult for me right now  The thought of sharing myself with someone scares me   and tbh Im not super motivated  I cant help but think everyone is talking shit about me for some reason  Ive been living by myself for 6 years now and I wasn't feeling all that lonely so I never put a priority dating  but now that I moved and my neighbors are a bunch of college kids  my life feels empty compared to theirs  The thought of meeting a bunch of girls sounds great in a superficial way  but Im not very motivated to do it    Its fucked up  almost like im living my life for someone else or to put on a show  I honestly don't know what I want out of life right now  I honestly just want to drive around and climb mountains  go biking  kayaking  etc but I cant live my life like that without some kind of income
I know it's addictive  and yes this is in combo with other meds I was prescribed  despite about 2 3 years of saying no to being medicated    I am very cognizant of the fact that Xanax is extremely addictive and I was have been open with my doctor about being worried about that  Both my doctor and therapist agreed on this line of treatment   I have friends with anxiety who take 2 mg a day and seem to think it's normal which I think is fucking insane   I worry about taking my small amount  idk how they live with themselves taking so much  I'd be petrified  
I wouldn't recommend benadryl at all for anything

Apply for free health insurance  I'm sure you could get it or talk to someone close and ask for some help with your anxiety 
Trying to make friends with her is the best way to go  People in this situation need to know someone cares about them  even if it's just the new neighbor who is friendly and makes them feel safe  Once you can establish a bond of trust with her then you can talk about the abuse you hear  but definitely don't predicate your interest in her on trying to help her  She may tell her abuser and that will make it worse 
Are you seeing a therapist   I ask because it sounds like you already have a diagnosis of PTSD   If you are  this is a good thing to bring up with them   If you can  be patient with yourself   A lot of times the mind just pulls up memories that have been put to the side because of trauma on a case by case basis  when it feels able to handle them or safe enough to grieve   It's impossible to rush or force that 
thank you   really helpful   
Yeah  I'll just echo the therapist  they seem dumb  but the right one is the right one  And if it's dumb and it works  it's not dumb  P
Thanks     Well  that's the thing  This model is helpful for me because I've only ever experienced the latter of your two situations  I imagine    based on what other people have told me about their experiences    that once you're in the midst of a full blown psychosis  you aren't going to pause and evaluate  "hey  does what I'm experiencing right now make sense " So I think the prelude to any of this is being able to recognize that you aren't in the most rational frame of mind 
Great advice  In addition to solving the immediate need  it also reinforces the belief that you are worth caring for  which I find helps me

I cannot stress enough that YMMV and your personal experience is going to be different from everyone else's  You should pay attention  or even keep a log of strains  amounts  etc  If you keep a mood journal definitely include this   I can't drink since going on meds because it makes me violently ill  and I don't like an alcohol buzz anyway  I'm prescribed 2x1mg day of xanax because klonopin and valium are useless   I started smoking at 30 for physical health issues  and was diagnosed bipolar at 38  Mostly a daily user throughout that time  predominantly vaping flower  more recently vaping concentrates      A Day in the Life     I woke up one day to an extreme anxiety attack  I took 1mg of xanax and after two hours I still felt no relief  At that point I took a couple small hits from a kush oil cartridge and in 10 minutes I was feeling better  Plus  I'd much rather be a habitual cannabis user than get addicted to benzos   I'm BPII and psychosis has not been a problem for me  nor do I experience any hallucinatory features  whether smoking or not  I experience paranoid delusions  and sativas can definitely make that worse  I generally prefer indicas and hybrids for that reason  and try to avoid straight sativas unless I'm in a really positive mental state and I'm trying to get super faded   If I were predisposed to psychosis  I'd be much more wary 
This right here is why I wish I lived in a legal state  or just had better dealer  and could buy only indica   About 3 4 of the time I find it relaxing  but the rest of the time I get a batch that just makes me extremely anxious and paranoid   Luckily he knows about what I got going on and he'll buy it back from me when that happens  but I'd rather just avoid that happening altogether

Yeah  I don't know if you live rural  urban  or suburban  but a change of scenery can be helpful if it's financially viable  especially if we feel stuck in a place we have so many negative thoughts and feelings towards  Cities tend to have better mental healthcare access than smaller places  and more diverse clubs and groups  so if you've got passions they can be better accommodated and you can build your tribe a bit more  you know what I mean  I grew up in a town of 1000  was bullied and belittled constantly  there was never anything to do and I had to be driven around all the time  I now live in a city of 400k and there's opportunities galore  but sometimes my own self esteem makes it hard to get out and take advantage of them  But yeah  talk about the change of locale with the therapist  see if they think it could be good for you  If you like them  they might even consider skyping or whatever in your new location 
This is an awesome attitude  It takes so much strength to choose to fight depression  Just remember to set realistic expectations of yourself to avoid being disappointed and becoming demotivated  
Every now and again I go through a period of death anxiety where I'll think about it and have a panic attack  The unknown is scary  I'm not sure how much this will help you   but I know it has sort of helped me  at least for now    In the book "Slaughterhouse Five" by Kurt Vonnegut  I definitely recommend it   the main character is supposedly kidnapped by aliens who believe that instead of time happening in a linear fashion  everything that has existed does exist  and always will exist at some point in the fabric of time  And this got me thinking that I actually agree with that  albeit from a fictional book  We all have our little mark in the universe and we all exist somewhere in time  This way of thinking alleviates the "I'm gonna be dead and gone" feeling a bit for me    I know it's hard to think about these things  especially when you have anxiety  But we're all in this together at least  I hope this helped at least a little  
I'm awful at math as well  I'm sorry to hear you're having a bad birthday OP  fuck school fuck studying and fuck all those students at my college that humiliated me  
 hugs    No one but you gets to make the decision of whether you live or not  Personally  I think things can almost always get better  and anxiety almost always lets up  I just lost someone because they felt the way you did  I hope that you will let yourself believe there is hope  and I hope that things will get better for you    I don't know you and I don't know your situation  Maybe it is really that bad and always will be  But for me and everyone I've met who were in bad places and suffered from anxiety  the key was changing the situation or reframing it or reaching out for help  There was always something good in their life  or the possibility of something good  even if the only person willing to provide the good thing is ourselves   Wishing you all the best  I hope you are able to find your way through this and find a way to alleviate your suffering and find some peace without killing yourself

I haven't worked out in over a week because of the holidays and I really hope I get to the gym tonight   Getting back into a routine  life wise AND gym wise  is difficult   I plan to do my normal weight routine on the selectorized machines and then hopefully jog 30 mins on the treadmill   I really need to get switched over to freeweights  I don't feel see any progress on the machines   I'm still having anxiety about this though 
I have health anxiety as part of general anxiety disorder  It's just another on a list of things for me to worry about  My main concern is having a heart attack or cancer  I get heart flutters and irregular beats as part of the anxiety  for no reason and at any time  So this contributes to my conviction that I'm going into heart failure   I even get so convinced that I think the doctors have misdiagnosed me and that I'm gonna die of a heart attack and end up in the local news as a medical negligence and misdiagnosis case  Genuinely concerned about that happening   Anyway  as far as medication goes  I am on beta blockers  which helps to combat the physical symptoms  Taken twice a day  I am also on fluoxetine  an anti   depressant  to combat the psychological symptoms  They have helped me a lot  as I took myself to ER three times when I first started experiencing anxiety attacks  I've been once since  A word of warning though  anti   depressants will make you feel even worse for the first couple of days or weeks  The side effects are awful and you'll want to give up on the medication  But I pushed through it this and I feel a lot better since my first attack

I experience adhedonia from time to time  Your meditations sound so boring to me it's no wonder you don't find pleasure in anything    Have you tried sensory mindfulness  I tend to eat fast and it makes my weight suffer so I focus on mindful eating  Take for instance oatmeal with chia seeds and peanut butter  I focus on the smells  I like the way warm peanut butter smells  I like crunching on the chia seeds and sucking them out of my gums  Oatmeal has a smooth mouth feel and goes down thick  Feels so warm and gooey in my stomach  I do this will most meals I eat  I also think about how that piece of food grew  all the people involved  and ended how up with me    I do long walks in nature and focus on the sounds and smells  I love hearing birds chirp and keep an ever watchful eye to spot a squirrel or chipmunk scurrying around    Have you tried tickling yourself with a feather  It feels so tingly and cool   Your solutions are text book and rigid  Have you tried watching your favourite cartoons from childhood  Maybe watch a mindless slapstick comedy    Exercise is good  I love lifting but they're very controlled environments with no room for spontaneity  How do you feel about rock climbing  Are there any zip lines or outdoor adventure courses nearby  How about a kick boxing class  Maybe try your hand at a dance class  Nothing brings about emotions like moving your body to some salsa or disco    The real problem I think is     I do not like my chosen path that I am on  It doesn't seem like there's anything to look forward to after graduation  What do you want to do after graduating  
It is hard to have someone leave and it will be a big change  There is the chance things will change between the two of you  Personally  I would try to take at face value his desire to continue the relationship  and see how things go from there  Video chatting is a good way to keep in touch  and if you already have an internet connection  it's free  LDRs are a lot easier than they used to be    The other thing I've done when I've been worried that my boyfriend would leave me has been to remind myself that even if he does  I'll be okay  It would hurt to lose him  But I would still have a lot of other good things in my life  things that are under my control  and I would eventually go out and meet someone new  
I really miss being a kid and not having a care in the world
Thanks so much for the reply  yeah  i do get a bit of heart anxiety too and experience some of those things  im glad to hear the meds are working out good  That adjustment period with meds and feeling worse is what im most nervous about

I am sick of this life too although I hope things get better for you
I really like that  We all have our mark in time  It also helps me to acknowledge that every single person we encounter in our own lives won't exist either  Nobody in 2100 will know our entire global society  It makes the whole thing seem less lonely and something we will all face together xx
My last job was miserable   I loved most of the people  even enjoyed what I did  but my boss was a complete asshole   The management were all shady as well  tweaking things on our clients' accounts without telling us  like they'd set their spend limits up  and at the end of every month suddenly they'd start getting more than they wanted and paying more than they had set up for  most of them didn't notice  but when they did they were understandably furious and often canceled  which then reflected on us as account managers because we were paid on retention and revenue      If you ever brought it up the reaction ranged from shrugging at you and saying you should do a better job of selling them on spending more to screaming at you and telling you that you were incompetent for not selling them on spending more   If not for the CEO and VP I'd still be working there  but I wound up finding another  better company to work for doing essentially the same thing but making 3x as much   The management are still not perfect  but the expectations are laid out very clearly and there are no surprises   I'm much happier now     My suggestion would be to keep an ear to the ground for new options   With your experience  you will probably qualify to find a supervisor job somewhere else  and get paid more while doing it 
Looks like I got myself a therapist next week   
of course  oh my good are you kidding me  i got really shitty days on meds  Every experience is differente   family  meds  therapy  whatever works for you  you have to take every approach to get better
Please do not feel bad about calling  You did the right thing  Too many people will not call 911 because they are afraid to be wrong or to waste the police's time    I was once staying with a friend in motel on a beach  The room above us    furniture was being thrown  loud voices  a kid screaming  My friend did NOT want me to call 911  fear of retribution   But I did  Apparently there was some bad stuff going down in that room because there were cops swarming all over and a few even took off hell bent for leather when a car peeled out of the parking lot    I feel like I might have saved a child  saved a person who was being abused     might have broken up a meth ring  Who knows  I am glad I called and you should be too    Too often when someone is in need  too many people stand around afraid to do something about it because they think someone else will and that they are not qualified to do anything  Don't fall into that trap  
It only took me a month to get an official diagnosis   I had one two weeks in from a psychologist but I don't count that   I saw a psychiatrist two weeks after that and got my official diagnosis 
I just want to say it looks like marker or tattoos  I don't think it looks bad  But good for making it through  and I hope you keep holding on 
Tired and frustrated  and embarassed because I'm coming here for support and haven't given a whole lot 
I was diagnosed at 38  It took 8 years of ineffectively treating major depression until a particularly insightful doctor identified it as BPII and got me on the right meds  It's five years later and it has not been perfect  As my doctor puts it  meds don't cure the condition  they try to reduce the severity and frequency of episodes  That helps stay more stable and reduces future neurodegeneration   I think the key is to be open with your doctor  I generally advocate against revealing your suspicions to the doctor so as not to put your finger on the scale  but I'm rethinking that position in light of how long it can take to arrive at a diagnosis  If you think you're in an episode right now  it would be good to have this conversation while you're still showing  and remembering  your symptoms 
Damn can I relate to this  Not sure what to tell you because I'm in the same boat but keep being strong and keeep fighting your SA  It's perfectly fine to have off days  everyone experiences them  Just gotta find  the strength in you to get up and keep going 
Thank you very much for your insight  The part that you describe about ADD or as I found it to be named now ADHD  without the hyperactivity and me being an introvert  resembles how I feel about my self and the decisions I usually make 
I am so sorry   I have no words 
I did get treatment in my late teens  but it was antidepressants and I'be been on and off of them for years now  Might as well be sugar pills    Exercise has been the only thing I would consider remotely effective  If you think it might help then absolutely give it a shot  
Maybe consult an OCD specialist 
yep its weird 
I have the same feelings   All of mine deal with me being an ass and going off on somebody with some being local politicians and local government   I feel like an ass and I want to get out of this area just for some distance between myself and the issues I have created   Now it is possible that nobody remembers it but in my mind they do and think about it often 
My condolences   The amount of people who manage to take their own lives lately is scaring me   There must be something to be done  Things cannot keep working that way 
Both my boyfriend and I have anxiety and struggle with how we feel about our appearances  It doesn't have to stop you from having a relationship  Personally  I think pretty much everyone is lovable  That includes you    A couple of years ago  I ended a long term relationship where both of us had made each other feel awful about ourselves  I left feeling like a disgusting human being  physically and emotionally  For me  the answer was a combination of spending some time working on my beliefs about myself  reminding myself that everyone has problems and makes mistakes  everyone has needs  I am as important as anyone else  etc    and having a lot of casual sex  I know that  just the way the dating market skews  that may not be as viable a solution for a guy  It was helpful for me to see that there were people who would were willing to sleep with me and spend a little time with me  If you can do some casual dating for a while  perhaps that would help  If you can't  that's okay  too  Just remember not to sabotage yourself when you do date or spend time with friends  Don't tell yourself that the people you're with are probably doing it out of pity or obligation  They're not  If they keep showing up  it's because they want to  If they act like they like you  it's because they do  If you can remember that  it will make it easier to find a relationship  I think  It has for me  
You're welcome  I didn't get any symptoms with the beta blockers until I had my dose increased   Then I started to sleepwalk and talk  Eventually my body got used to it and that stopped too   It's the fluoxetine that was the worst  I would have adrenaline rushes every time I was dropping off to sleep  so eventually I became scared to fall asleep and stayed away until I pretty much passed out from tiredness  This lasted about 10 days  I went to the doctors about it after day 5 and he just said 'yes  you'll feel worse before you feel better'  It did really suck but the pay off has been worth it   I had tried two other kinds of anti   depressants but the side effects were so bad that I had to switch to something else  I just kept throwing up all day on those two   I can honestly tell you that getting through the adjustment period is nowhere near as bad as living with full blown anxiety all day  every day xxx
Use sex as a motivation for girls  Love can come or go after but sex is a good starting point  You have a stable income so you have all the opportunities to do the things you want  Just get out there and do it  Don't wait  Your not a kid so you gota use your time wisely before you start to get kids and all that

Sometimes the transition to college is just overwhelming and in a bigger community there are less people taking note of you withdrawing  It becomes very much up to you to make the effort and this can be difficult especially if you already have some trouble with social interaction  You say you enjoy the one close friend that you share a lot of similar tastes with  maybe they have some other friends you might like  Or try joining a college club for something you like  If you find yourself really withdrawing then maybe seek some help  A therapist can help you either get to the root of this or develop new skills  
ahh okay  that's really helpful  thank you so much for telling me your experiences 
I often find the kindest and strongest people are those like us  We can be so sick of life and hate ourselves but we know true empathy  Even though life feels like it's shit   So guess what  you're an amazingly kind person and you'e so strong    Also  I try to watch something funny  Even if we don't laugh  it's nice to see others do it    
You'll be okay    Start by cutting things down  If you study only 10 minutes at a time  that's okay  But actually try and study    Go for short ten minute walks  It sounds stupid  but it actually does help  
It sounds like you had a really great base to start from due to your hard work  You can find it in yourself to be who you were and build upon that  I think cleaning your living space and giving yourself a fresh start before you start aim to set out what you want achieve is the first step  As this has been going on for 2 yrs dont be afraid to seek professional help too
This is really great  I am so glad to hear other providers are increasing accessibility  All our services are online because honestly it is sometimes so difficult to get to an office  
Yes  I don't ever have the classic panic attack anymore  I don't hyperventilate  I don't have a racing heart or feel dizzy  I just get heart flutters  followed by pins and needles for absolutely no reason  even if I'm just laying in bed watching a movie  That's what makes it so scary  Because you're thinking 'I can't be having a panic attack because I'm not scared right now  ' Xx
I feel like therapy can't help me  I've been seeing a therapist weekly and haven't seen much improvement  My problems seem to be beyond fixing 
   The difference is that this time  Im completely aware that my ideas could be considered delusions while at the same time believing that they are true      It's a weird feeling  right     Also  Of  course  you were caught off guard the first time  since you had never been diagnosed  and thus never forearmed   Knowing yourself is so critical  I tend to get a lot worse  in that I'm more prone to believing weird and terrifying things  when I'm under significant stress  and also in winter  It helps just to know that  because I can look back and be like  "Does it make sense that shady government agencies ramp up their efforts to fuck with you every February  Is that like  your designated month in some CIA database  Orrrr are you sliding your belief axis way up while the probability axis remains static  Gotta be the latter  right " And I like that because it doesn't invalidate my fears  but it doesn't let me get away with twisting them out of all proportion either  "This may still be possible  but it's also still unlikely  The fact that you're believing it more is unrelated to the degree of likelihood or risk "
Hi  It sounds your therapist is not the best person to you  It is true  that therapists can't make anyone happy  but they are helping people to face their problems that person can build their life better  It's something we just have to make by ourselves  but other people's support on this "journey" is really important  But it sounds your therapist was a kind of rude to you  Can you ask if you can see someone else   And please  Don't say therapy is pointless  cause for somebody it's really effective and important  It's always good to try   I REALLY hope you find someone who can help you  Don't give up 
This is super common  People with anxiety have trouble shutting their brain off and if you have a stressful job that can just add to it  To be honest though if you didn't have the job your brain would probably find something else to worry about  Maybe try some relaxation techniques to help calm your mind before bed  I find this one particularly helpful  http   blog tranqool com 2016 02 01 do this 1 thing to sleep better 4  utm medium Reddit utm source Reddit utm term sleep relax
I did something similar   I got it in my head that I needed a new car   A few days later I went into a dealership and financed a  40k car that I couldn't afford   That was ten years ago and I still have the fucker   I won't allow myself to get a new one until this one is in the ground 
OP one of the things a fellow redditer told me once was to practice telling yourself a mantra such as "I am totally independent of the good or bad opinions of others"  I'm not Sure if it'll have a significant effect on you but I tell myself that same line throughout the day  truly internalize it  and I noticed it has really helped me  
I would do research  Research  research  research   If you get a jump start and take control of your own mental rewiring process  it will make the whole therapy process a lot smoother and you'll make about 10x as much progress as you would otherwise   That's my advice   I used to want to kill myself all the time and I managed to get over that on my own by basically researching and building my knowledge base and mental tricks   My favorite trick is to simply say "irrelevant" when an oppressive thought comes up  It's a worthless thought  therefore it isn't even worth my time  Sure  it might still make me feel shitty  but I can maintain CONTEMPT for the feeling of shittiness  Depression can suck my ass  basically 
I am  I have PTSD for other reasons as well   This is a new development  and it was Xmas then NYE break so I couldn't see her until this week    I'm trying  I'm trying to put the feeling out of my mind but my bf is starting to ask questions to which I have no answers  I don't remember my childhood at all but you know that nagging feeling  It's really bad and gives me anxiety  It's terrible  
I don't have full blown OCD  but I do have many of the symptoms  I've spent a lot of time wondering whether I might be bi  While I haven't had the same experience  I have had some women I've been very close to and loved nonromantically  and I have wondered whether I would be interested in them romantically  For me  it has come down to just running that scenario through in my head  what would it be like  to be with one of those women romantically  How would it make me feel  For me  the conclusion was that I just am not into women sexually    If your conclusion is that you're not into guys  then you're not into them  Feeling close to someone doesn't have to mean wanting to sleep with them  If you did want to sleep with them  that would be okay  too  For me  part of dealing with intrusive thoughts is refusing to give them the weight they want  Okay  that thing I'm afraid of could happen  Most of the time  it wouldn't actually be a big deal  
Honestly that's really not  that  bad  I've heard of many guys and gals who never get into any up until their early 20's and they have no problems whatsoever with it  It's not too late   I'm the same actually  gonna be 20 in less than 1 month and I never have either  not because I never had a chance  but because I've got personal issues  Currently in intensive therapy now to try to cure myself of all my issues before it's too late  you should do the same     I've never been kissed either   not even on the cheek 
Good  good  let the anxiety flow through you   Seriously   you will need the adrenaline from the second you step off the bus   If you were just like 'meh ' I'd be worried      But also  I can bet that every  Single  Recruit  Is feeling just like you right now  So know this  within 24h of arrival you will know all the people in your section and feel like you belong with them   Secondly   you will be so busy  tired  and adrenalized  you won't have time to think or worry about anything     This is going to be the start of something great  a lifetime defining moment   As far as I can see  the anxiety is both justified and necessary   normal and reasonable      Just do the best you can at any given moment   don't let your mind wander even during apparently 'downtime'  and remember the reason you are going is to BE trained  i e  they will give you guidance every step of the way    And after it's over  you'll have made some of the best friends you will EVER have in your life     Respect to you 
It doesn't sound like you have much of a choice so try not to feel too bad  I'm sure they will find him a home 
When it comes to depression regiments  I notice people are looking for the "miracle" pill more often than not  Therefore  a big part of discussion revolves around nootropics  Most fail to realise that food is a drug  in a way  Different ingredients contain different chemical compounds  such as you mentioned  having different effects on different individuals  given their genetic biochemistry  IMO daily food has a much greater effect on physical and mental wellbeing than taking ginkgo balboa  reishi mushroom  or any other standalone supplement  Until we start paying attention to what we eat  it's hard to establish a baseline from which to then introduce supplements for incremental improvement  I'm a big fan of the elimination diet from which to establish such a baseline  which is supported by your post  For all we know  we're consuming something daily that's poisonous to us  and perhaps is the underlying cause of why we're feeling so shitty to begin with  
I miss being a kid too  I was a completely different person  I remember years ago when I first started to get depressed  and I look at myself now and see how it has integrated into my life  and slowly crushed and dulled out any kind of happy person I might have been  Lacking motivation is the worst part  I feel like I've already accepted failing any standard  I'm 22   but motivation is something I still try to fight to find  but always fail miserably     
Awesome  thank you for sharing  Do you follow any recipe books or meal plans at all  or do you just have your own meals from the foods you allow  Is this mostly like a paleo diet or keto or something like that  I feel like inflammation is what is effecting my depression the most  since I have crohns disease as well  so I would really be interested in learning more  Thank you so much
It can really help to challenge your thoughts  When you have anxiety these thoughts come up and we really have trouble controlling them  If you start looking at them with a critical eye it can help    For example  dogs have rabies therefore I will get rabies     really think about this for a moment  all puppies  unless they are stray  have been vaccinated for rabies so if the dog has an owner they're not going to have rabies  This takes practice but it can be really useful   This video is great for explaining the negative thought biases  https   www youtube com watch v sA0qcELeGl8 t 8s

Pain is relative  so be nicer to yourself about it  It's how you feel and that's valid enough  It's not about whether you "deserve" to be miserable or not  based on what degree of work you think you've put in to creating a meaningful life  If your external circumstances were different due to your putting in more effort  as you say  you might be happier  but you also might still feel like shit  It's a cliche  but ultimately happiness come from within  I'm sure some of the people you perceive as "halfway up the ladder" are struggling with their own issues of negative self perception  I'm not saying don't try to better your situation  but you have to take care of your inner life first  As to how to do that  I haven't figured it out either  I think sometimes chronic low grade misery is harder to deal with because it's functional and easier to hide  It doesn't force you into making a decision  checking into a hospital  for instance   but can still be hell  It might not make you feel better but I feel stuck too and I'm sending you some love

I've finally been diagnosed with GAD after two years of taking myself back and forth to ER thinking I'm having a heart attack  It came to blows when I had what can only be described as a breakdown one day  I woke up and from the minute my eyes were open until about 11pm that night  I had palpitations  Fluttering heart beat  skipping beats  doing one big massive thump all day  I thought I was going to die  I did nothing but cry and frantically pace the house trying to get it to stop  I had no idea why this was even happening as there was no trigger  That's what makes GAD so life ruiningly scary  How can you be panicking when you have nothing to panic about  It MUST be a serious medical condition   Anyway  that night I took myself to ER and they kept me in overnight cos I was thinking about hurting myself  I've never felt so low in my life  I finally got to talk to someone and have a proper diagnosis  which has since led to proper treatment  My anxiety symptoms have greatly reduced since then   But yes  the fear of it building back up to that extreme is always there  People say don't fight a panic attack  just let it happen  way easier said than done and almost always ends up in complete exhaustion and feeling defeated   GAD is horrible  It's like having two voices in your head arguing constantly  One is rational and calm  the other is irrational and frantic  When I'm having a bad bout of anxiety  that irrational voice is always the loudest  Worst case senario is always the most likely outcome when that's in charge 
Just like that    
I was put on the same dosage of the same medication  but had to come down to 25mg due to the side effects  Had an amazing impact on me for the first 6 months  but now I'm thinking I need to get the dosage raised again  Good luck  
I'm 27  almost 28 was diagnosed bipolar ii 10 years ago  and I self medicate with weed  Only difference is im a female  Got a great job but I hate it and want to throw it all away  along with my degree  for something completely different  Don't know what yet  but I find myself stuck   Anyway  I think if you try to open up to other females  you might surprise yourself  Maybe try taking a class on something you're interested in  or joining a club  Sorry if this was a useless post  just wanted you to know that you're not alone 
Hi  I'm not sure if I can help you  but I will try  I don't think it's normal to have that kind of effects after two months  cause side effects usually last max a month  Escitalopram surely can cause more anxiousnes first  but I think it's possible that those meds are not suitable for your friend    Try make your friend to go see the doctor  Doctor knows these things better and it can be that he she gives some new meds that hopefully are better to your friend  It could also be nice if you go with your friend to see the doctor in that kind of situation  Support is really important 
I took the 10mg version for about 7 months before I started the 20mg  and I never experienced anything like what your friend is experiencing  You should try and get him to go see the doctor  and if he continues to refuse  you should try and convince him to at least call the pharmacist who filled the prescription  
I don't know what you went through  exactly  and it might be more severe than what I suffered  I'll give you advice based on how I experienced things  The first thing you'll want to do is prepare yourself mentally   Writing about your abuse means confronting and reliving it  to an extent    From there  just write whatever comes to mind It's fine if it ends up as a nearly incomprehensible stream of consciousness at first  You can polish it later    The important thing is getting everything   your thoughts  emotions  and perception   down on paper   
I actually had the opposite with my Sertraline  Started taking it  felt some very bad side effects after just 2 dosages  Lots of sweating  overheating  trembling  and more anxiety  Maybe I'm just one of the rare cases of having side effects  but it's something that anybody that starts taking Sertraline should be aware of  
Just a bit of formatting advice  erase the " " at the beginning of your post so it's easier tor read
Sounds good     
The office isn't too far  but it's because my mom is working late and can't take me  and my sister can't take me because it's a bit late
I feel the same exact way  Doesn't it just suck 
For me it is  I probably couldn't cope with my anxiety   depression without meds  
lol not even on the cheek 
You did the right thing and I'm glad you're proud  as you "should" be   Who knows how bad it might have gotten if left alone  you never know  that's the sad thing   If only more people would do stuff like that  the world would  be a better place to live in  Good on ya and what a great way to start the New Year    Keep up the fantastic work   And i bet it will inspire others  wait scratch that  because it looks like it already has  Stuff like this saves lives  
Hmm  I want to give "Fuck Feelings" a try  This society makes us feel so damn guilty for depression  
had one or two on the cheek but never the lips 
I'm so glad that you enjoyed the writeup      I typically make up my own recipes  as it's difficult to find recipes that oblige to my specific dietary standards  I would say it's a pretty strict Paleo diet with the added step of eliminating nightshade vegetables  I'm not sure what exactly to call it yet    Ugh I'm sorry that you are dealing with Crohn's disease  my aunt has it as well and I know how trying it can be  I think you're probably right in suspecting inflammation as a major contribution to your depression  As a side note  I have eczema which is also an inflammatory disorder and I definitely notice that my eczema flair ups often coincide my mood changes  which are typically a result of my food intake    Would you like me to share a few of my recipes  Are there any foods that you don't like to eat so I can have an idea of what to send  
Damn    I feel bad for you  I hope you can go through this and feel happy again 
Talk to her  Try to remind her what sort of person Jack is  Try to explain what a person like him would do to a child    But understand that she might not listen  When I was with my ex  my friends spent three years telling me how toxic a person she was   It wasn't until she violated a major boundary that I realized they were right  and cut ties    The most important thing is that you continue to support her   This article on CNN explains it a bit better than I can   http   www cnn com 2013 01 10 living friend domestic abuse   
Thanks   I haven't had any casual encounters in almost five years because I'm super scared about STDs and HIV and the like  Guys don't seem to really be interested in me other than really old guys that are out of shape  and I've had no luck on any dating sites or get any matches  I feel like all I'm good for right now is someone who needs to get off and are super desperate and not appreciate me at all    But I read everything else you said and it sounds great  I hope so   
Thank you
I'd strongly recommend some  r wholesomememes for some anxiety reducing and kind place 
That's not too bad but so many people have trouble getting help because therapists work very restricted hours  or are unaffordable  I am so glad you found something that works for you 
I think the best thing to do is either chat to the person that's currently prescribing your meds or get a second opinion  which you really are entitled to do  There are so many variations and combinations now  in the past you would just be given meds and told to deal with the side effects 
Thank for saying that  as I was typing this on my phone frustrated and mad  I waesent even thinking how I worded my scentences  
Based solely off your description  it sounds like you could be shy introverted  when you're in public or with many people  do you ever feel yourself getting sweaty  heart racing  or mind blanking out  Also  any feelings of avoidance or any other physical ill feelings  Those are more symptoms of social anxiety  If you just have an actual preference for solitude and smaller social niche  that's not social anxiety

Good luck  I have never taken medicine for depression  managed to find ways around it 
I would recommend recording evidence of this if tries again and reaching local authorities for a restraining order 
Exactly  I couldn't have said it better myself    I think that food is too often ignored as a major contribution to how we feel as well as how we function  I have tried over 15 different types of pharmaceutical medications for my bipolar  mainly trying to eliminate the severe depression  and none of them worked  Instead of thinking about my lifestyle  including what I ate  I was diagnosed as 'treatment resistant'  I still struggle sometimes  but I'm more stable and hopeful than I've ever been     For all we know  we're consuming something daily that's poisonous to us  and perhaps is the underlying cause of why we're feeling so shitty to begin with    This is so true  which is why I decided to make this post in the first place  I never would have suspected that gluten  dairy and nightshades were having such a horrible effect on my mood  
You aren't  even if we can't be there next to you there is a community here that actually cares  I care  I honestly do because I know how you feel and that is why I don't want you to have to go through it alone   One day everything will be OK and you will be happy  stay strong    
Thank you so much  u theironyengine I really appreciate your input  And I love the term "squirty water enhancers "    I actually bought some of those and haven't used them yet  That would be a good thing to try for the new year  Thank you  
These kind of posts make me happy  Makes me feel like it's not all doom for us SA sufferers  I  too  am feeling good about this year  Good luck   
I was better functioning and unmedicated while I smoked daily  Less dismorphic mania and depression still had wreched mood issues and was unaware of the havoc my emotions were reigning upon my SO  but high functioning  I paid my bills on time  went to school 2 times passed my classes with flying colors  got a great job  put myself in a great position to climb the corporate ladder and all I had to do was take 2 puffs and walk out the door  I wasn't getting "totally baked  dude" just getting enough in my system to keep things buffered  Now I take 5 medications daily that TRY to do what a little bit of weed used to do for me  Bull shit I say    weed helped me  I'm not saying it'll cure or help everyone but for me it's unmistakable how much I benefitted from it 
I do  I do believe in karma  but sometimes it doesn't always happen the way we want it to be  Karma always hits me  that trash i forgot to pick up off the floor  Someone's going to lecture me for it and make me feel guilty even though someone just left a pile of trash next to it  I feel like i'm always to blame and have to live in fear and anxiety   while others never have to care for the consequences of their actions  It's weird  and hard to accept  
I agree  there are ways out  Just gotta find what method works best for you
I've had both the copper and the meraina and I didn't notice any issues  
I had a friend who had been molested and "sold" a lot at a very young age  She lost her vaginal virginity when she was 6  She had a strange sex life  but had learned to empower herself  She began working with the mentally handicapped  where I worked  and was amazing with them  She just had her first child a year and a half ago  She is a little older than you  but I guess what I'm saying is that eventually  you can start to accept that as a part of your past  but you can have hope that it will not define who you are and who you become 
We've been altering meds every few weeks but nothing is working  I think medication can't solve my issues  Still holding on for some reason  I think only because I'm afraid of death  Although my mom and therapist say they see improvements I am still not functioning 
I understand that it was a 30 seconds speech but can you practice it at home in advance  I get exactly the same way especially when everyone is watching me  Most of the time people are busy thinking about themselves so they wouldn't notice that you feel awkward  I know it's easier said than done but keep working on yourself    You cannot quit now because maybe you will be faced with the same problem at your next job  I haven't tried one on one coaching but I am planning to join improv class  I hope that it will help me not to freeze during moments like this  
Is that    Harambe 
This isn't mbti  but remember you barely have any cognitive functions strong in you right now  besides your first perceiving function  which is the least relatable to almost all other people  As you get older you will relate more to others  Additionally  as others get older  they will relate more to you   Also  some people can't even function without helping others  Also again  some people would be insulted if they found out you didn't go to them when you needed someone  Yes  you're right and some people would feel burdened  but many people are the opposite of that and wouldn't feel burdened at all 
Oh my parents have accepted that  they don't talk to me about religion or church at all anymore  
I scare off women all the time  I'm either too forward or they lose interest because I'm too nervous to make a move  Sometimes my nerves overpower and I shutdown  I try to explain to my friends  but they don't understand how troubled I am with it they just think I'm in the closet  It really gets me down not being wanted  
I'm very guilty of using dark humor to cope when depressed  
I feel you  I'm the same

I have a bathroom in my room but I still take off all my clothes even when I just have to pee  I clean my bathroom myself yet I still don't feel comfortable with my clothes touching certain areas in the bathroom   I just drink less water when I go out so I won't have to go to a public restroom   It's a nightmare but I was worse off before and I'm slowly starting to cross off OCD rituals but this remains the most difficult for me  
Could this also happen to a girl  I feel the EXACT same way 
I make sure I have a relaxing nighttime routine   Right now  this includes showering at night  smelling lavender essential oil  and progressive muscle relaxation   That got rid of the night terrors and reduced nightmare frequency from nightly to weekly   Prazosin has been super helpful for me recently and has made the nightmares I do have much easier to deal with 
I was bullied really badly all through every year of school so I constantly asked myself those questions  Then  as an adult I moved to the city and realised I was likeable and attractive and actually pretty cool  People actively sought my company and affection   So nowadays  I genuinely do not care what people think of me  Because what is a thought  It's someone else's own voice in their own head that I can't hear  So why am I even worrying about it  It's literally unnoticeable unless they speak it  If they speak it  then there is a problem  and 9 10 it's theirs  For example   someone doesn't like how I look  Simple answer  don't look at me then  cos the people in my life who's opinions matter think I look just fine  and how unhappy are you in life that someone elses face creates such hatred  Don't be defined by strangers  because you will never please everyone  Always listen to the ones closest to you who genuinely care    I don't get sucked in by trolls because they don't matter  All you need is that extra boost of self esteem and nobody can hurt you unless you let them xx
Im a senior in HS going into uni as a CS major next fall  Im not ugly or anything  but am a super lonely introvert  I hope to God something changes in uni  but being a CS major makes me have my doubts  
I've been unemployed for around two years  I made the worst decision of quitting my job before I found a new one  A month later  my boyfriend broke up with me and I've been on a downward spiral for almost a year and half after that   Mid of November  I got in touch with an ex colleague  and things were looking up  I really really like the guy and we've been texting and meeting up for the past two months  He's been having trouble with work and finally handed his resignation today  The problem is that he's moving back to the US in a few months  I'm not an American  and this has put a but 'IF' on our relationship  He thinks this might not lead anywhere because of his move and is thinking of ending it   It's been a while since I liked a guy this much and I really do think this can go somewhere  The thought of him breaking this off is already hurting me  I don't know what I would feel like if he really does end this  I hope he doesn't  guess I'll have to wait till the end of this week to see what happens   He previously asked me if I would eventually move back with him and I said I'm not really sure I would  I'm not sure I would like it there  Now  not so sure   Wish me luck  I really don't want this to end   He was the only thing keeping me going

Finally taking and accepting Sertraline to help me was one of the best decisions I have ever made  I was in a bad place already and I finally took the courage to go to the GP and ask help  She gave me the same dose  Took 50 mg for 1 year and it was the best  But after a year  I needed to decrease the dosage to 25 mg due to side effects  mine was too much sleeping and couldn't do any work done due to sleeping too much  Hahaha  but at 25 mg  Sertraline is still my bestfriend  
I feel you  I really do  But 3 weeks   You gotta realize these feelings and thoughts are INSIDE YOU   There is literally nothing threatening about the job  the people or the company   It is all a matter of perception    So go back on the hunt  but don't quit   Put your shields up  find humor wherever it can be found  don't cut yourself off from help or friendship  but don't let the aholes get to you   And especially  don't become one    You are a round peg in a square hole   it is up to YOU to find a 'dream job'  Recruiters just want to make a buck  they literally do not care    You can rise above all this by KNOWING in your heart that it's not forever  and you will find something great 
I was shocked when I found it  we all think we are the only ones that do it  but we aren't 
     Yes  From my observations  there are two types of "ignorant"  ignorant but maybe willing to listen  and ignorant and hostile  The first step in these types of situations is to figure out what kind of audience is being approached   Yeah  This is kind of a mantra I've been repeating over and over to all my "gonna unfriend the Trump supporter" friends  I  as in  "I u JesusHMontgomery"  was a shitty white person for a long time  I wasn't about to tattoo a swastika on my forehead  but I did think that maybe "they just need to pull up their pants " and if it wasn't for some long suffering  no doubt very frustrated  individuals  I'm not sure I would have ever stopped thinking those things  The kind of change people want to see comes from gentle friendship  not from excommunication   though sometimes a person is that toxic that's the only option you have     until I reminded myself that it's for my own safety   Yeah  and that's where it gets dicey for non white people  I feel like there's the potential  if things become the worst case scenario that I fear  that white people won't get instant protection  like they do now  But it's already dicey for non white people  There's this link floating around about this black man that has convinced something like 200 KKK members to leave the KKK just by being their friend  It is  genuinely  inspiring  and heart warming  and I'm so glad that man exists  but I think there's an implied narrative in the way the internet  read  Reddit  has been spreading it like wildfire  this guy is one of the good ones  and thank god  because otherwise I might have to talk to them     Sometimes more privileged allies  White  straight  cis  neurotypical  etc   can be misguided or ill informed or merely part of movements in order to get attention or to collect cultural capital  but I rarely encounter these types of people    This is a relief  I often read pieces online about opportunistic "woke" white people  or faux feminists  I personally haven't encountered any  but I learned that my reality tunnel is pretty narrow currently      Thank you for being kind  especially online where it's so easy to be hostile  It means a lot these days   Dude  absolutely  Sometimes I try to point out people's needless hostility to them  because something about the internet just causes it  It's not even the anonymity  because people are even monsters on Facebook where you can see their full name  where they live  the last 7 meals they ate  and what kind of spider scares them the most  I think if people could commit to being just 10  nicer online  a nice small number to start with   the world would feel so much safer   But yeah  I don't know if this is stereotypical of white people or not  but I kind of obsess talking about all this stuff  and love the opportunity to do it with people who aren't me  and are also into it 
Hey     I'm going to talk about a couple of broad things here  but PM me if you want to chat in a bit more detail about some of it   My experience with depression  and I think a lot of people will share this view  is that it is something you have regardless of how you are feeling  So even if you are joyous  you still have depression are depressed  I mention this because I think it will help to clarify the way you look at the condition  Especially because you said you are motivated for the first month of study and then fall into depression  I think it will help you to rather look at that fall as an expected and manageable change of emotion as opposed to a 'fuck it  now what ' moment   But visiting a psychiatrist is an excellent choice  and I agree that it's scary to start with  Just remember that it's not their job to judge you or your decisions  they're there to help you understand why you made them  And ultimately it's your decision to speak about something or not  but obviously the less you engage the less they will be able to help  Neither my parents ever understood my depression  Dad passed away a few years ago so it's just mum now and she's seen me go through a serious rough patch   cutting  hospital  stitches   but she still doesn't really understand the depth of the things that affect me  Sometimes it's just a case of giving them time to understand or finding another way of explaining yourself  Which is hard  A really lame example is my introversion  My mom is a hairdresser and after one really busy day she said she was exhausted but filled with energy after interacting with all her clients  I told her I feel the exact opposite  social interactions also exhaust me but they leave me feeling down and dark too  It was the first time she started to comprehend how I feel about socialising    I can keep going about everything else you've said too  but let me leave it here  because maybe you think I'm talking total shit so far  Message me if you want to chat  And I'd be happy to read about the other 90 percent of what you want to say   
I have Type 1 Bipolar Disorder  and one of the pharmaceuticals that I tried was Lamictal  It didn't work for me and I experienced negative side effects  but nonetheless  it could work for you  Here are a couple articles I've found on the topic     This  https   www ncbi nlm nih gov pubmed 22322995  article is a review which states that lamotrigine seemed to benefit people with borderline personality disorder as well as people with anxiety disorders    This  https   www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles PMC3628173   article states that antiseizure medications are helpful for the treatment of anxiety disorders  They are increasingly being used instead of benzos because of the negative side effects and addictive properties     Lastly  https   www ncbi nlm nih gov pubmed 23945444   this study shows that lamotrigine has been found to provide a benefit to individuals with unipolar depression  
It sounds to me that you are an introvert    it is totally fine to not like hanging out in big groups and preferring it to be more private  it's only a problem when it makes you anxious thinking of or interacting with strangers
How long did it take for you to start feeling the zoloft taking effect and what changed  just curious as i just started taking it and have done for almost 2 weeks now
When I try to shrug it off and laugh  people can see I am bothered by it  Being criticised gives me a feeling I have had and remember from grade school when I got it pretty bad  It's a visceral reaction that people notice  I know a need a new view and out look on life  I just don't know what that is   I new way to think about things  Like  not thinking about anything except what is going on in that moment  etc  Actually showing interest in what people say  Only showing my real emotions  But when I say goodbye etc people are smiling  but if I smile it's so obviously fake  I've seen myself in the reflection and in pictures  people can tell   Thanks so much for listening and your advice  I will use it 
I just started too  Side effects are starting to show  otherwise it seems to help with mood quite a bit
that's a bit scary but not what I  meant

First thing's first     you are not a failure    The fact that you're even able to keep it together most of the time   let alone attend college   is incredible  Were I in your shoes  I don't even know if I could survive a day    Check with your college's disability office to see if to see if they can help you out  As for your boyfriend  I can't really give more advice without knowing what kind of problem you two are experiencing  Maybe give him some time to cool off and talk to him again  
I understand your frustration and am sorry  But please  all this man needs is some support  
definitely not a useless post  joining a class or club is a really good idea  Thanks for sharing and responding    
Did they 'fix' it for you 
Same here  I miss having this 'content' feeling inside me  Everyday is a struggle and sometimes I just think it would be easier to end it all  I really do miss being happy  Or content at least  
Just stay calm lil buddy  You should start taking down how it affects you  Present how you feel to your doctor  You aren't trapped taking them and you can get off them if they don't help  If you feel like medicine could help but the one your on doesn't seem to work  Talk about it  Different one's affect different people in many ways  Good luck on life  hugs 
I don't know any of you  but I've never felt a greater urge for some strangers to be happy  I want you to be happy  I love you 
Thank you  Like many others have said please spread the truth  Call out people who say those things  I admit I was one of them until my disease kicked in  I really wish society would separate the words Depressed  depression from sadness  or at least come up with a more clinical term for this illness  
What do you mean by too forward  X
Thankfully mine was is all inward facing so I don't have sex to satisfy the urges   Instead  I have masturbated everywhere you can think of including cubicles  public bathrooms  and even while driving on the highway   The worst part is that  due to it being inward facing  I have no need for sex with my wife and that doesn't sit well with her  understandably 
This might not be the greatest view ever and certainly won't work for everyone  so just keep that in mind   I'm a total existentialist and I'm quite firmly of the opinion that life is pointless  absolutely without meaning  As are our lives  But it is in that meaningless void that I do  in fact  find purpose  I immerse myself in my work   I just want to help people so even if I can smile at a supermarket teller and have them smile back at me I feel like I've made a little difference   I'm not suggesting you adopt a position like mine  but maybe start basic  Instead of looking at your life in the greater scheme of things rather focus today on looking for a job  Maybe tomorrow it's simpler  whatever  When you realise that you're able to constantly reassess where you are and what you're doing in life then you'll be able to think about the big picture  Be careful with your goals  you say you want more out of life but what does that mean  You might end up with a boat piloted by little robots  but that will still leave you feeling empty because you don't actually know if that's what you wanted  So find the meaning in what you're doing today  have a purpose that you can achieve quickly  and go from there 
Thanks for the help  What about the eye thing though  Honestly I think I just let my eyes wander  its just kind of awkward we got a connection from that    And the weed thing feeling love in my heart    Am I trying to think too much into this 
They take a few weeks before having an effect Sauce  I've been on zoloft for 3 months
Be patient  it takes a little bit to feel the effects  I'm proud of you  I found the hardest part of the whole process was mustering up the courage to get meds  So good job and I hope you're feeling better soon  
If there is  i cant think of it   I don't have an outlet like that anymore  
yeah it's really weird and confusing 
You aren't a disappointment  Depression makes people irritable and people who are depressed tend to seclude themselves  They don't enjoy things like they used to  It can get better  If she knows you have depression  I am sure she understands  For a mother  it is hard to see her child go through such a difficult thing  You can get put on meds or if you are not in favour of that  you can try other methods to help with your depression and things can be good  It is not your fault  
I usually would have an anxiety attack and then get nausea but this is backwards  I'm wondering if the nausea is triggering the anxiety  The nausea begins once I've completed my routine  no matter how much time I spend   then I have the anxiety  I can deal with the anxiety but I just don't want to throw up at the gym   Not on any medications  been off ssri meds for a year now   Only supplement is creatine which is a recent addition   There are so many different ways to trouble shoot this I'm actually very optimistic   I'm gonna try to drink less water tonight and maybe spend more time between sets tomorrow  Just make one change at a time until I can zero in on the culprit 
I'm here  talk to me
2016 actually went by so slowly for me despite finishing my first year of college  transferring to a new college and city and going on vacation twice  It was a looooong year  but I still know what you mean  I went past my old school today and I felt sad and it's so strange because I live on the same road as my school and saw it a million times since leaving and didn't feel anything  but anxiety makes me feel like ughhhhh when I see it  And yeah my sleeping pattern is godawful I went to bed at 5 30 this morning 
I know how that is  I'm sorry   Do you live near a university  Many offer free community therapy programs  You'd be talking with a student  but it might be better than nothing at all 
Given that he went home before he started v  he might be the kind that would rather tough it out by himself  My bf had a really bad bout of noro and I called asking if I could do anything for him  i e  drop off some pepto bismol or gatorade or something   and he was in so much agony that he just wanted to be left alone  He was also embarrassed I think and didn't want me to see him like that at that point in our relationship  we'd only been together a few months   Maybe you can offer to drop by with supplies and see what he says  He may not feel up to it and you'll be off the hook   
Update  I'm giving the same medication another try right now  I heard from my psychiatrist that I can expect to feel sick for a week or two and then see positive results  I don't know if I'll be able to stick to it  but I'm trying again 
i'm female
This is excellent advice   Generally the police contacting the individual is enough to make them stop   But don't take this lightly   Your safety and life depend on it

Yeah  you're being irrational  but hopefully I can help talk you down  Restaurants  especially reputable ones like how you mention this one is  have very stringent requirements about workers not coming to work in the kitchen when they are ill  That's why things like the outbreak at Chipotle don't happen more often  the businesses would be liable if one of their employees knowingly spread noro around to a bunch of customers    Try to distract yourself from the anxiety this is causing you by doing something enjoyable  i e reading  watching tv  listening to music  taking a walk  
I just want to say I read your post and I hear you  At least this very moment you are not alone  I feel your pain and understand what you're going through  I'm not going to make this about me but trust me that I know how you feel  I will not dare telling you what to do I just want you know that at least right now you are not alone and at least one person understands you  
I'm not much of a hugger anymore  but I'd give you one of my bear hugs right now if I could  Breathe deep 
Sounds like a misunderstanding  Perhaps you took it too personally

  I don't know if this is stereotypical of white people or not  but I kind of obsess talking about all this stuff  and love the opportunity to do it with people who aren't me  and are also into it   Nah  this is counter to the stereotype that talking about race makes White people uncomfortable  You're doing a good thing by being open to discussing issues of injustice and listening to marginalized people  Please keep seeking out these opportunities  but also make sure to keep your mental health in mind  this is  r Anxiety after all 
No dude  you'll be fine  Obviously you'll need to start confronting your symptoms a bit more but I promise you won't turn into a maniac tearing people apart for their next fix   
  I took it in high school to deal with anxiety issues  It actually helped a lot back then  it was easier to focus on work and make friends  etc      My boyfriend and I started to grow apart though  because it kind of made me "emotionless"  The way it worked for me is that anything negative that would come to mind just wouldn't stick long enough to upset me      But it made it easier to not care about some things I should have cared more about  I stopped taking it for awhile and when I started again it was after having eating disorder induced anxiety  It made the anxiety worse     I don't know your situation or reason for taking it but those are my experiences with it  There can be negatives to taking it or positives depending on what type of anxiety you're having      As far as the side effects go  I would just watch out for personality changes  weight loss  or psychological effects if you miss or take more than prescribed  Those are the only ones I experienced    
Anxiety isn't rational  if you're stressed performing high pressure procedures that is rational  Anxiety stems from irrational thought biases that we have  I find this video explains it really well  https   www youtube com watch v sA0qcELeGl8 t 8s
Hey I want to say to you a huge CONGRATS  You have a fear that has controlled your life  you lived your own true worst nightmare and look at you    you SURVIVED  You are FINE  No lasting problems  you are no longer sick and you only got sick because YOU made the choice to have a fun night and drink  Nothing out of your control  You weren't dealing with something awful like food poisoning or a virus  You were partying  And you puked  And then you felt better  And you never have to puke that way again if you don't want to  It may seem scary to imagine it happening now because you're imagining doing it sober but don't worry  I promise you you won't drunkelny puke if you're sober     From one emetophobic to another  I'm proud of you for going through it like a champ  Now treat yourself to something good  you deserve it  
First thing I'd avise you to do is   get rid of that gun    Seriously  you should not have something like that at home   Now  you clearly have every reason to be depressed  You had a rough life since the very beginning  But there's one thing I think you should consider  do you really hate your current situation or is it your outlook on life in general  You said you feel like another relationship or another job wouldn't change anything  so maybe it is the depression making everything shitty  It might not be  maybe you should push forward and look for new opportunities  Hell  it could even be both    How much do you talk to your wife  Does she know about all this  A relationship doesn't exist in a vacuum  The two of you can make an effort to find more things in common  take up new hobbies  explore new things in bed  If you're not leaving her  maybe you could try to breathe new life in the relation  At worst  it would help you understand what is wrong with it and what you are looking for   Also  I know being hospitalised is not a trivial matter  by maybe you should actually seek it  If you went as far as buying a gun  your suicidal thoughts are probably very severe  you should not be afraid to be helped

Give it some time but you have just taken an amazing first step  Be patient with potential side effects but make sure you are talking to your prescribing doctor about them because it can take a bit to find the right pill dose 
SSRIs generally take weeks to months for therapeutic effects  Just be patient and keep taking it while watching for side effects 
Out of curiosity  did you notice yourself getting distant 
Reading my own story here   What bothers me now i feel tired and low energy  From day to day  Googling about cancers and deadly diseases   Fuck this shit  
I have dealt with this issue  so you are not alone   I spent a long time being told it was stress based asthma and was given a rescue inhaler albuterol  for it after taking chest x rays and doing some breathing tests   This was the worst thing that could have happened because it made everything worse   what the actual problem is is hard to say  but I did black out a couple times because of it   I dealt with this issue for probably 2 years in which my stress levels peaked quite a bit  then it subsided after I made some life changes   It did come back during some serious stress in my life and still does from time to time   What has helped me   Its hard to say   After being put on a variety of different medications  it eventually subsided to only having the issue about once a month   I was also seeing a therapist during this time and it may have helped   I remember the neural feedback that he did with me helped my breathing quite a bit   Everyone's body is different  so it could just be stress building up inside of you   Wish I could be of more assistance  but again  its not just you 
I think it took about 1 month  It's one of those things that if you have severe OCD for instance  about 1 2 months later you realise like 99  of your old is gone  Give it time  I don't recall the exact time it took but it was anywhere from 1 2 5 months for it to fully take effect   Take care

Hi  Fellow POCD sufferer here   I know the feeling  You don't feel like you're worth anything because of your OCD  and you feel like you want to scream it to the world so they "know what you are "  I've been there  and it's all part of the process  I think it's called an urge to confess   confess that you have these feelings that you can't pinpoint and it makes you horrible   But it doesn't  I hope I'm not on the reassurance line here  because that is actually not helping the coping process   Acceptance is a huge part of getting over your fear of going outside  and accepting the thoughts is hard  I know  because who would want to accept these thoughts      and you need to work with yourself and  if you have a therapist  that person  to get outside of your comfort zone and begin moving around again   Look at me  I've had it for close to three years now  diagnosed  and now I'm able to help with children again  I still have the thoughts  but the point is I am able to work past them and just realize that they are thoughts

Hi OP  I know exactly how you feel and in fact came across another thread you started which I could have posted almost word for word  This made me create a reddit account in the hope I can help   I have felt like this for years and recently it has become intolerable to the point I have attempted to end things on several occasions  I'm taking medication and seeing a therapist which hasn't resulted in any major improvements  As I'm still thinking of ways to end it   It's awful to be in this position and I've said that I wouldn't wish such feelings on anyone  so I truly hope that things get better for you  Please feel free to drop me a PM and tell me about yourself and if you would like to chat  I hope I can offer some suggested actions which help you   Keep moving forward  inch by inch  
This is how it works in SA  it may be slightly different in the UK  You doctor can prescribe anti depressants  normally not all that strong  I think I went on Cilift for a while  They won't expect a follow up but If you wanted to increase you dosage or move onto something stronger you'd need to see a specialist  Hope this helps   
Hi  I've replied to you before and I have to ask if you have sought professional help   The reason I'm asking is this is apparently really affecting your quality of life  If you don't have a therapist  I would highly suggest seeking one out  I am on a low income program through our local mental health center  and that is an option  Usually your state has one 
25 and divorced here  too  I was about to write the same comment  What an inspiration  I'm currently looking at flights and things to do in neighboring states    to go by mself  How terrifying and exciting all at once 
Can your bf be let to know that it might be better to save those questions for another time   If you're already feeling anxious it probably doesn't help to be made to consider this stuff     It might be helpful to do some of the anxiety calming techniques  if your therapist has mentioned any   like tapping  or yoga  or controlled breathing   Also  you might reassure yourself  I am safe now   I am in a better place now   It is okay to be afraid  but we are in a safer place than we were 
My ex was the same whenever he got drunk  to the point I would avoid him if he had alcohol in his system   I'm really sorry that happened to you  I don't know your relationship  but mine only got worse from there

What's the fucking point g I'm just gonna fail life anyway  This term is my GCSE thing and I just don't care lol  Everyone wants me to succeed but I don't really care  Rather be dead tbh much more relaxing and nothing to worry about    Not that im worried either but I just get so angry when those therapist people or whatever they're called start giving their opinions    'school isn't an option' 'we just wanna see you come out of school with something' 'just go to school you never use any of those support options we give you'   Man I fucking get it okay but I don't give a fuck what you think  only time I've fucking felt happy in this shitty world is when I smoked a joint for fucks sake what kind of awful life is this   And why is everyone so insistent on getting me to haul my ass to school for some paper    Just don't see the point in living anymore  I almost never feel alive  but when I slipped out on my skateboard into the road I felt adrenaline  Loved that  makes me wanna skate down roads onto oncoming traffic and see how fast I can fucking die 
Sounds like a good plan   Creatine can make some people nauseous but if you had it before that addition then it must be something else

Past sexual traumas can definitely impact future relationships  I think it would be helpful to go to RAINN org they have resources on there and if you go to their chat line  the counselors can send you links to further reading on how to address the struggles you are facing now  I'm sorry about what happened to you  but eventually with time and effort you should be able to cope with what happened and have it affect you less 
Oh hey  are you me   I was on Paxil and soon after the anxiety went away  I was still somewhat anxious in hard social situations or when travelling  but everyday anxiety was manageable   I am not off it for a few months in order to try on my own  plus the sexual side effects were crap   Nope  can't do it  The anxiety came back  and I can't even manage it with 0 5mgx2 of Xanax a day  started with 0 25mgx2   My stomach is killing me in the morning  and I feel the need to puke  I eat way less  I am very uncomfortable in social situations  and only alcohol helps  which is not something I want to do   Going to see my doctor on Friday  If anyone has anything to recommend  I'm listening

Yeah   I've said that  I told him it's making me super anxious  I'm trying to put it out of my mind until I speak to my therapist   I have heard of tapping  and tried it  but it doesn't seem to work  Neither does breathing  However  I haven't tried yoga   Thank you  friend  This helps a lot 
In 2011  I was working on a ranch  I was in high school  I was an avid athlete  and sports were my life  It was the end of the school year  and open gym was about to start  my favorite time of the year  because open gym meant we could play co ed  make our own teams  and play whatever games we wanted  basically I got to win every time    I went out on the ranch  made a pile of cactus and brush I had pulled out of a fence line  and lit it on fire  In the process  I gave myself second degree burns to my right arm and face  I was alone  I was hurt  I had to get to a hospital  As I started to heal  I would lay in pain on the couch  with my parents constantly checking on me  Crying in the shower  I would have to scrub my healing skin until it bled  so as to be sure there was a blood supply to my infantile skin  As I was crying one day  my father came in the bathroom and sat on the toilet by the bathtub  He gave me the single best piece of advice I've ever received  "Give in to the pain  Stop fighting it  You won't win  Pain is an error window on the computer  and in order to get rid of it  you can "X" out and it will come back again  or you can click "OK" and acknowledge that it's there " After returning to school  I didn't think about life or death anymore  just the next girl  the next game  the next party    Fast forward to the August after my high school graduation  and I am getting a job in the oil fields of South Texas  Best decision I ever made  I worked my way up to a position in which I would drive  alone  to locations sometimes two hours away from our main office where I reported to work  About a month into it  I remember a specific trip  I was driving to a location 2 1 2 hours away and I couldn't see any other cars and I thought  "If I died while driving  no one would find me " I hearkened back to the words of my father when he worked at a job that had him isolated for long periods of time  "There is not time like alone time  It teaches you more about yourself that anyone else will ever know " Usually I remember my father's words with comfort  but this day  I remembered them  and they fell into the pit that was an overwhelming cacophony of the noise of my thoughts  I started going numb and shut down  I pulled over and sat on the side of the road until I relaxed and thought  "What was that "  I began having these fits often  and would call people to keep my mind off of it  but lo and behold  as soon as my phone screen read "NO SERVICE" I was falling in a hole of despair  One day while I was driving  I began to have a panic attack and remembered my dad's advice about pain  I gave in to the panic  I rode it like a wave and thought about the causes and effects of what I was thinking  "I'm having a heart attack "  you're not having a heart attack  You're 18 and healthy  How could you possibly have a heart attack  "I have a brain tumor "  so what if you have a brain tumor  you're fine right now   "No one will find me if I die "  everyone dies  and if you die  you're dead  What do you care what comes after   and thus began my path to less anxiety    The big lesson overall is that we all die  We all have fear of death  At times  fear of death is paralyzing and panic inducing and brings the strongest of heart to their knees  One of my favorite quotes is from Mel Gibson's character in  Gladiator    "Death smiles at us all  All a man can do is smile back " So do just that  Smile back  Fight that bastard  Tell him  "I'm not going down without a fight " Death in inevitable  but life isn't  So instead of worrying about the death that comes for us all  we have an obligation to worry about the possibility of not having lived  I  personally  try to make an impact on everyone's life who I meet  If death comes for your body  it comes  But it can't extinguish the flame of your life    TLDR  Don't take life too seriously  no one gets out alive    
I haven't tried switching doctor's yet   Too busy getting written out of my family's will and getting kicked out of the house    
what i've found helps me is doing puzzles  You can break it up and take as much time as you need  But  when you are feeling anxious at home  just sit down and focus on a task  By the time i'm done i'm no longer feeling anxious and it's mentally exhausting so it does help burn excess energy a bit  
Okay   It wasn't important I just wanted to let you know how little I could tell about who you are 
upvoted for visibility  I don't really have an idea  maybe try calling a local doctor and ask them about the clinics       By googling I found this website http   www freeclinics com sta washington  in the top right corner you can look for more and there is a list  I hope you find help  good luck 
Better to have called and it be nothing  then to not have called and it have been something worse  Good job  OP 
When you first start talking about it or getting therapy for it  it won't be easy dealing with what happened  You may hit low points but ultimately addressing it  will lead you on a path of recovery  It has been nearly a year for me since I finally admitted to myself that I was sexually abused and only now can I cope with what happened  I wish you the best of luck 
I force myself to be in social situations quite often  not to mention my job  But it never goes away  in fact lately it's very strong  I can barely look at people sometimes  because when I do they can see something is wrong   Thank you
Yes and then I realized laughing while crying makes you look insane    Edit   more insane 
Keep trying  I felt the same way for so long  I thought things would never change no matter what medications I tried  Now in my clarity I can see it was largely the depression talking  telling me nothing would tame it  Realistically the depression may always be there  but if you keep trying you'll find something that can loosen its control over you  Listen to your mom and therapist too  For me I never felt much different or anything for a long time  but those close to me could see small improvements when I felt none for months before I actually started to notice any real difference myself  It's harder to see from the inside   I truly hope you find the right medication s  to treat your depression  and you feel so much better very soon  It's taken half my life to feel like my depression and anxiety don't completely control me anymore  
I want to be a guy who you can look in the eyes and just feel comfortable 
My personal anxiety tool is a little bead string that I made for myself with different shaped beads on it   When I get upset  I sit with it and press on the beads and count them  so I don't get all caught up in my head   
OP if you really hate school  just quit  I am in college rn and I hated high school  if I had to redo it  I wouldve got a GED and enrolled in community college or online college   School was hell for me  so much busywork  sleep deprivation  and the long ass commute  coupled with lack of friends and loneliness   I graduated frm that place and honestly  I barely learned sht there except that I will never enroll my children in public schools   I suggest you see a psychiatrist first tho because they might prescribe you antidepressants 
Thanks for posting this  I've had quite a bit of depression since childhood and quitting gluten had one of the largest impacts towards getting better  Other dietary tweaks were made possible afterwards since I had a much clearer mind and body  Increases in good proteins with every meal and a dramatic increase in fats while keeping carbs on the lower end of things has made the blood sugar fluctuations decrease to a minimal amount  
Hi  Yes I am going to a therapist for Cbt   All I've had is my introductory session as of now  And my next proper session is on 5th  with in that time it's getting worse for me but just for this segment alone  being something I wanted to put it out there and ask for some pointers so I don't end being like this for months until my therapist fixes me  Hoping she does  
That sounds like it could work for me  as I dissociate a lot  I get caught up in there a looooot 
Im not sure this is the correct forum for your post  You admit that you didn't study enough  You admit that laziness is a factor  Most people that are high achievers  like your friend  prefer to be surrounded by like minded people  Don't take it personally  I'm not sure what your question is but does it have to do anything with social anxiety  serious question  
Start small would be my advice  Exercise and reading are both excellent and very easy to pick up  You don't necessarily need to hit the gym  Start with a simple bedroom routine just basic movements nothing intense no weights necessary just your body and working on breathing  Meditation also ties in with exercise particularly the breathing exercises  Hell even try going for a walk or hike  Researching programmes and techniques online should get you into the habit of reading  After that pick up a book or comic  if it's been a while re read a favourite just to get you back into the habit  I'd suggest fiction to begin with because non fiction tend to be way more academic   Listening to music is always a good distraction as well  Hanging out with friends and family as well  Has worked for me when I was in a better frame of mind   I've heard woodworking and lego building can be quite relaxing although never tried it personally 
  I read somewhere recently that the only way to find something  real  with someone is to genuinely be yourself  I have anxiety too  and it's difficult to imagine anyone else really knowing what we go through on a daily basis      Whether it's obsessing over the smallest things  or feeling hopeless suicidal some days  or feeling like we're just not "normal" enough for most people      Be yourself  There are so many people out there  just like you  Express what you like and like to do  And if you're nervous and think you're going to say the wrong thing  don't get ahead of yourself     Don't go about it as if you're going to mess things up  or you're not saying the right thing  Say what expresses  you  the most      If they're right for you  they'll like you for the person you are and accept any problem you might have  I think the best way to have a relationship you're really comfortable in too  is to be friends with someone first  It's a lot easier to start things out that way when you're not sure how to immediately go about dating   
Take a look at Brené Browns 2 TED talks  I come from a similar experience and found her talks incredibly insightful   From my experience  poor self esteem isn't about my relationships with others but about my relationship with myself  The abuse I received as a child has been internalized and I have been abusing myself all these years  Fortunately making up with myself is more possible than making amends with family  
This will get buried  but     About 5 years ago  my MIL that I loved dearly died on Dec 7th after a protracted battle with cancer  My FIL was on antidepressants but it just wasn't enough  My MIL had a beloved dog that we bought her a few years prior to her death  We were hoping the dog's loving presence would help her emotionally  and he did  and all of us fell in love with him  After my MIL died  my FIL was so lost  He insisted my husband and I go out with our friends for New Years Eve like we had planned earlier in the Fall  So with misgivings  we went    On New Years Day my husband received a call from his dad  and he could barely understand him because he was crying so much   This is a family of people that don't express emotion  so him sobbing to his son was unprecedented   Turned out their beloved dog suddenly developed seizures within a week's time and died traumatically at the Vet's office in the wee hours of New Years Day   I will never forget standing there in the parking lot of the restaurant  our friends still seated inside  the wind bitterly cold  the crash of the waves from the coast  as my husband and I cried silently  because we didn't want to upset my FIL  The complete emptiness  staring at the too bright sun and hating everything so  so much  What "loving" god could see a reason in taking a grieving husband's last link with his dead wife  It was literally the worst sequence of events in my life  I became a robot and dissociated from my feelings so I could be the rock my husband needed  but I will never forget the overwhelming tide of pain that ensued when I finally opened myself back up   Fast forward to now  my FIL remarried  there was drama initially   both hubs and I adore this woman  they moved to the country and he is HAPPY  He told me last Christmas that he could never have imagined something this good for himself during the darkest  bitterest time of his life    It's like Sam says to Frodo  how can you go on when there's so much hurt  how could the ending be good  Because the heroes of the stories we love had lots of chances of turning back  but they didn't  They kept going    I want you to keep going  It's what your mom would want  You're not alone in your grief  Good things are still ahead   hugs  Mourn and remember her  but don't stop moving forward   3
Yeah I know of those programs   I got to find a great therapist this year who didn't cost much  and I'd like to find some way to stay with this practice  but that might not be possible 
Hi there  Let me start with this  the great thing about college is that you don't have to go into it knowing what you want to do  Hell  even people who think they know end up changing their minds once or twice  It happened to me  and I thought I had it all figured out  The important thing is to try different classes and see what makes you excited and hungry to learn more  But that's a little bit into the future   let's talk about the present    Right now  it sounds like you may be depressed  I've learned that enough anxiety can do that to you  They go hand in hand  unfortunately   It sounds like you want to learn skills like cooking and building   but lack of motivation  possibly from depression  is keeping you from doing so    My suggestion would be to find a way to tackle this lack of motivation  Start exercising a little every day if you can  see a doctor about depression if you can  Learn to meditate  See a counselor  at school or a private one  to learn how to gain confidence and practice social skills    I have tried these things myself  and they have helped me  I'm not "cured" of my anxiety by any means  but I am in better control of it than I used to be  I wish you luck 
Thank you for this   it was touching and really gives me a lot to think about and work on  I will refer back to your words when I'm getting lost in those thoughts  Means a lot  thanks  
That's shitty  but hold strong  It might sound hokey but try getting some exercise if you can   like get your muscle sore  Once things die down hopefully you can get in to see someone who can offer better help 
Thank you very much   u throwban
I was thinking the anxiety of worrying about what he thinks  It can make me feel anxious around him because i never know when he's thinking ill of me   However  I suppose you're right that I know what this is about  I can't force someone to like me if I'm not respectable as a person but it sucks because i don't view myself as someone who isn't well meaning and it depresses me that it matters so much how well I study in regards with who wants to talk to me  I understand it  but it makes me sad 
Thats a good way to start  if you want to talk  im here  
This is in no way just me promoting a channel  I just want a way to speak how I feel without it being personal with anyone  and I genuinely want to help others 
I've just started mine as well  I tried antidepressants like 2 years ago  but didn't take them seriously before and quit after about 2 months  recent events in my life really put me over the edge and I hope they help this time around 
Well  on that one  I don't know      Only you can tell whether it was just a passing thing or indicative of real feelings for your friend  And only you can tell what you'd like to do with those feelings if you do have them  Good luck 
Yeah I've had it checked a couple of times  Also been checked for diabeties  viral infections  sleep apnea  various stds  and various blood diseases  Physically I'm pretty healthy  which is good  Just wish I could wake up 
Just threaten you'll report him for harassment  Most guys don't want to pursue after that 
There are times i feel completely worthless  i totally get that feeling   Albeit for different reasons   I really think the PTSD exacerbates the issues   It feels like everything i do  nothing is right   I have made some really awful comments to my SO about how she needed to just leave  about how it's really what she wants to do   My photos  they almost always end up in garbage because i hate how they look   So after so long  i just gave up and became so complacent that she really did want to leave   Of course this didn't help the depression   But  let it be known  you have nothing to feel guilty about   Tell this to yourself everyday if you have to   Easier said then done  i know  you'll get there   Another thing  focus on yourself   Take at least an hour each day  just you  and do what you like   Read a book  take pictures  paint  get a massage  whatever  but it's just you   Then  take the smallest problem you have and work on it  till you overcome it   For me  i have personal space issues  so getting a massage was a huge deal   So i worked on it until i did it   But do it for yourself  you are the only one you need to impress right now  everyone is secondary or just plain vapor 
Ah  that makes sense  Perhaps you could practice working on your confidence privately  I have spent several years working on changing the way I talk to myself think about myself and my life  I remind myself that I matter as much as anyone else  that everyone makes mistakes  that I do a good job with things  and that my feelings matter  And when I don't hate myself  it makes it easier to be confident interacting with others  I don't know if that helps  I hope this gets easier for you  Good luck 
Good luck with the testing  I hope both of us find the right medication 
Practice  Based on your post it looks like you spend too much time on little details that may or may not be true  It's almost like you have to invent something negative to dwell on  Or if you hear a positive story  you will find the one minor negative part of it and focus on that  Stop doing that  If someone throws one dagger at you  you end up throwing 100 many more at yourself and beat yourself up way more than you should  It's not an attractive quality and you don't want to be a downer  Why don't you focus on the positive and not try to twist her words around into something negative  Just think for once maybe someone means what they say  
Sometimes  only because it was easier to ignore some of the things around me I should have been worried about  If I got in trouble over something it wasn't a big deal  if one of my friends or family members was having a problem it was easier to not worry about it as much  where normally it would affect me just as much  That kind of thing  
Thank you so much for sharing   it's very motivating to hear other people being able to change their brain function based on what they're eating  I'm glad to hear that changing your diet has had such a positive impact on your mood and mental clarity   I've been adding more protein in lately as well  since some days I was barely getting any  and I noticed that it greatly increased my energy  I hope things continue to get better and better for you

I understand that the dynamic is different in a society where men are expected to make the first move and face a lot more rejection than women  I do get it  at least a little  though  I'm get really intense about people quickly and I've been massively insecure  and both of those things have scared people off    Things can get better  though  Learning to be okay with myself has both made me less off putting to other people and more okay with the times when things just don't work out    Just because you haven't found a right person yet doesn't mean you never will  Good luck 
Everything you mentioned is easily within your control  Just study harder and be less lazy  It will pay off in the end  It's okay if he doesn't want to be your friend  Some people are like this  I would focus on improving your grades  Do it for you  though  
At the risk of sounding callous  not your monkeys  not your circus  You don't know her  anything about her  her name  and she's wildly unstable  I pity her but it's not your problem 
Okay  generally what the medication should be doing   I ask because a lot of my anxiety revolves around my relationship  And I'm a bit afraid of a medication causing problems in it  Though I'm so over the top now  if it were to do that to me  it might be good  So it feels kinda like "This could be exactly what you need  or it could ruin you "  In any case  That was really helpful feedback  thank you 
I am totally going through a similar situation  Your reasons are more than valid for feeling this way   hugs 
I haven't had a real depressive episode in the three years I've been taking them  except for the time I was an idiot and stopped because I thought I was cured  Not that things are never hard  but so so much better than they were before
Forward with my emotions and feelings  usually a bit too soon  I know that scares girls off  
You're right  you do sound callous  This isn't some random person   this is someone I spent 2 weeks in partial with   a lot of time out of partial under she started getting paranoid and cut people off  I know a lot about her  I don't know her last name because I was manic when I learned it and I forgot  I've met her mom   but I forgot her name too and never had her number    Do you really think of everything in terms of it's "your problem" or not  If you do  I feel bad for you  Not me

I       should have been a lot more careful  that's for sure  I was lucky that my lack of caution didn't land me an infection    That's a hard place to be  I've been there  too  And it's good that you know what you need and don't put yourself around people who would make you feel bad  You'll find someone who's good to you      
The thought of that honestly sounds disgusting  Thinking rationally about all this  I think I'm over obsessing
Well   kissing is overrated   But if it makes you feel any better   I'm 25 and have never had a relationship  
Also  something that I heard on my favorite Podcast   Mental Illness Happy Hour w  Paul Gilmartin   if you are interested  is online therapy  It seems to be a lot less expensive than visiting a brick   mortar therapist    I think the one he promotes is Talk Space  
You just have to talk  Easier said then done  I've been there before  One thing I learned is that people are more sympathetic then you think  I started being up and honest about my anxiety to people if they ever wondered why I was so anxious  Idk if it hurt or helped my social relationships but it sure helped me break my bubble of VERY terrible social anxiety  Now I only have it a little and is manageable 
There are more than one thing you should do  think positive  believe in yourself  have a good posture  go out more and practice things that make you "not confidence" 
Hello Rachxkitty     You are shattered but you can repair yourself like  Kintsugi  https   en wikipedia org wiki Kintsugi    breaks up are really hard  but they happen to lots of people and almost no one can deal with them  just saying you are not alone     I hope you are going to pull through  it won't just go away  the days are going to be harder  especially the first one  try to occupy your mind but as soon as you are "alone" with your thoughts it might come again  I think you already know that  stay strong              I don't know if you know the butter's quote but it really applies in your case   Butters  http   i imgur com ZccuADU png   granted this is a bit cliché  but still             Stay strong  good luck 
I used this to explain to someone about my life too  
Yes  she doesn't need to know this upfront  You need to get to know people more before talking about past relationships  I would also do some digging to find out why your previous relationships failed  Also I think this should have been posted in a relationship forum  And stop meeting people off of Craigslist 
Hey  you stood up to him that's definitely something to be proud of  It's still an awful situation and it was still super shitty of him to do that to you  but you should give yourself a ton of credit for not allowing him to continue taking advantage of you  I'm proud of you  
I post about this occasionally though not in this sub and I always get quite a bit of resistance to it  diet is a huge factor in mood and mental state   Diet and exercise have been shown time and again to be two of the most consistent factors in decreasing depression and anxiety  Are they a cure all  no  but if it can get us to a place where we are no longer completely debilitated then that's a big leap in the right direction  
  If most of your anxiety is relationship related  it should help a lot  Anytime my bf and I would argue it didn't last very long or affect me throughout the day  It generally just makes you a chiller person if you have a lot going on everyday      Hope it works well for you  
 hugs 
Yeah  you're right  Honestly  sometimes I wonder how much I care about what I study  but at the end of the day I can't think of a field I would be more interested in than what i do right now and I really do owe it to myself to pull through with it  Sometimes I do admittedly fall into a trap of doing something with my life choices dependant of what others might think    too much in fact 
That butters picture made me tear up   Thank you for taking the time to write such a sweet message   It hurts but I'm holding on 
I have lifted weights and running for 4 months without skipping days  Not a single day has I been happy doing it  Never felt any accomplishment or mental reward keeping at it  Something has to be seriously wrong with me  since other people say they get better from exercise 
You absolutely can  If I was able to get through depression  so can you 
gratz bb hope i helped a bit luvya papa bless
I feel you   I've had a lot of trouble with anhedonia and it's not easy to address without fixing underlying depression   Here's a couple things to try though    1   Adderall or other simulant ADHD medication   It won't cure the anhedonia but I find them to improve motivation which helps get things done    2   Agmatine is a supplement recommend by the folks over in  r nootropics as having some effect on anhedonia   I've seen some minor decrease from it 
I don't know what I'm doing anymore  I feel alone and stupid  So much is happening that I should be excited for  but I'm not okay  I'm not excited   I wanted to share my future with him 
You will always be  1  People come and go but you gotta focus on you  You don't want to pick a field to impress others only to be miserable for the rest of your career  You are so lucky to get a second chance on the test so really try and pass that  It will pay off in the future  Good luck  
You're welcome  To overcome caring about what other people think and having people like you  you just need to be comfortable and accepting of yourself  and surround yourself with people who feel this way about you too  Get to know yourself  your hobbies  your opinions  your role models  your goals  your beliefs  your flaws and your good traits  Get to know people who think like you and like what you like or even just share the same sense of humour   I'm confident in my personality but I still have some insecurities about my appearance  I often think I could lose a bit of weight or maybe wear make up more often  Then I think but who would that be for  Not myself cos I don't mind my looks  I'm not a model  I'm just normal  My boyfriend loves me  so do my friends and family  So I'd literally be making changes to myself for the sake of a strangers own voice in their own head  I go to uni every day with no makeup on  and I can see all the barbie dolls looking at me like I have two heads  I just look back at them daring them to say what they'll whisper to each other when I'm out of earshot and they never do  I think they're just jealous because they aren't comfortable enough in their own skin to show their natural faces  
I can't quit school  the police shows up in my house and I can get punished if I don't attend it  I talked with my parents today and they said I have to go to school and that they cant do shit   I don't know if I will make it until 2018 honestly  I'm feeling really upset and inferior to everyone else    I'm just hating my life 
You're lucky to have someone who's understanding about your anxiety  I've never had that  not even once  Not a friend  not a girlfriend  nobody except my therapist but he's a professional   not someone I can rely on to be there for me as a friend or anything  The glistens thing I've had was a girlfriend who didn't quite understand  but she was accommodating  But she left me because I become inconvenient in her life  I've come to the conclusion that my life would be a lot better if I could find someone who's comforting during these moments  and I'm on an endless search for that person  Sometimes I feel like I'll always feel lonely  that I'll never have a deep connection with someone else  Most of the time I feel hopeless    Edit  once a week is great if you ask me  
I am experiencing the same thing for a while  especially not eating a lot  for me I don't want to eat at any structured time  like lunch or tea and it's sometimes pressuring to have certain times set for meals and such so I just eat when I can  it's probably not the best thing but I can't force myself to eat food otherwise I feel sick  but if my stomach rumbles I know I have to eat something  I hope this helps  ask if you need any more help or want any more information

I have Mirena   I barely get periods anymore and they are very light when they do happen   
Tell me about it  The amount of resistance I receive whenever I post about non pharmaceutical methods to treat mental disorders is insane  pun not intended   Even though it is heavily sourced  many people seem to ignore it right away  I think there is resistance because people like to eat yummy things and don't want to hear that eliminating said yummy things could make them better  so they dismiss it  However  there are some people who are genuinely curious about it  which I find encouraging    It seems so common sense to me that what you put into your body will have an effect on your mood and cognitive function  I mean  look at the numerous studies coming out that show how intricately connected your gut microbiome is to your mental well being  Diet is just one part of the equation  like you mentioned but you're so right in saying that it can help you get to the point where you can better think and deal with your depression  
Thanks  It wasn't easy to try meds they terrify me  Last time I tried them I nearly killed myself several times  And now I'm dangerously close to attempt it again  Reaching out on Reddit seems to help in my worst moments  Reading others and leaving comments reminds me I am not alone  I just want this all over  I hope they even me out sooner rather than later  I'm on my second medication already  And I feel so much worse  I was doing better without them 
I might not respond right away  but you can message me 
Thanks    it's always reassuring to hear that
If yo simply never try or find anything you like  things will never get better   If you try they might and probably will in the long run  keep in mind long run  talking months and years  It's really difficult to find yourself  
Thank you  I'll check it out 
MERICA 
OK I will try doing that when I get my emotions together and stop feeling miserable
You're the one who posted  I was in an RTC for 15 months  do you really think I don't know what it's like to answer a call from an old friend in the middle of a psychotic episode  Or worse   Do what you want  call her mom that you met once or find her on Facebook if you're genuinely concerned 
When I felt bad about myslef or felt myself sliding downhill to my condition I felt that a strong comfort for me was music  certain bands that I could empathise with were my chemical romance  fall out boy  bring me the horizon  etc  they aren't calming bands but they help me channel my pain and help me reaslise that we are all in the same boat  everyone on this subreddit wants to help everyone else  If you want to talk to someone one on one going to the doctors or someone at your workplace  school college etc is a good place to start  even close friends or family is good too  I hope you feel better soon  
Yeah I agree but I am really sick and tired of being the 'invisible' kid in my class the one who no one cares about 
I'm glad 
I was off of all meds during pregnancy   At some point the OBGYN tried to put me on some medication  mood stabilizer and antidepressant  but the side effects made me too sick to work and I had to work so I just went without the meds   Post partum I got depression and psychosis   It was scary and I almost didn't go back to work and I could have harmed my baby   I was aware of it happening though and called my son's dad to come hold him   Shortly after that I was put on medication 
 I relate to this a lot  In my head I'm still a kid and I'm having issues trying to adapt to adulthood  
Can agree with this post  I use to take adderall in college when I needed to do a big project last minute or study  Now I find it difficult to focus without it 
Exact same thing happening with me  All I can hope is it gets better  It fucking hurts more than anything I've ever felt 
After 8 years with OCD the guilt pretty much disappeared  but a new feeling came in  I feel think that I am a worthless human being  spineless  That I shouldn't even get born  Wait  isn't that guilt  It's just that I don't feel terrified about intrusive thoughts 
I wrote a blog about some personal depression feelings I had  This was about 4 years ago  and the response I got was overwhelming  People thanking me and stuff  I thought people would think similar things  but sometimes you just have to do it  To quote Carrie Fisher  "You don't have to wait to be confident  Just do it and eventually the confidence will follow "
Please take this advice and accept it  Anxiety is a mental disorder  a year ago I wouldn't give you this advice  You need medication  I finally cave in and similar situation like you  Talked to my doctor and she prescribed me xanax and has helped me with those meetings  No refills  so you don't abuse it  It works  
The best place to go to find the answer to whether you are depressed or not is the doctors  I know it's not a particularly nice thing to do but personally I felt a lot better about just going and being diagnosed  it atleast helped me know what I was dealing with   I know this is a scary time but you can trust doctors they know what's best for people as they are trained to do so   I really hope you feel better soon please message me if you want any more help 
You could try boardgames   there's a ton of very cool ones being released every year  much better than things like Monopoly and Risk  You already said you like videogames  well  that's like that except you get to go out and meet people  sit down  have a conversation while you play  I'm actually going over to a friend's later today to play Star Wars  Rebellion which reenacts the entire conflict between the Galactic Empire and the Rebel Alliance  you can freeze Admiral Ackbar in Carbonite  blow up planets with the Death Star  or lead an assault on Coruscant  last game Princess Leia got turned to the Dark Side   It's glorious  amazing fun    Best thing about about board games is that you don't even need to buy anything to get into it  Just show up at a meetup and people will play with you  
It's awful  but you probably can't do anything here  If you have no way to reach anyone  your options are limited   And even if you did have this info  it's possible they know    
Antidepressants usually take time probably like 4 6 weeks  to work  Don't give up taking them if you don't see any results after your first couple of doses 
I took it once for anxiety while flying  It took about an hour or two to reach full potency and lasted at least 12 hours   I felt a bit loopy but mostly apathetic  I don't think my fear of flying was reduced so much as I cared less about being afraid   In that sense it broke the feedback loop to which I would fall prey   FYI  the labels aren't kidding  DO NOT have any amount of alcohol if you've taken this  I had a single beer 12  hours after taking it and blacked out within 20 minutes  not intentional  just stupid  
Now that you put it that way  it doesn't seem as bad  This helped me feel a lot better about the situation  thank you 
It  is  true for me  The last 15 years I did uncounted decisions under the influence of social anxiety  Trying to avoid it  trying to beat it  I will never know if anything I decide is done out of a clear mind or subconsciously influenced by my condition  I am unable to know if I am actually able to do or not to do something or if this is just my illness speaking  Is a decision reasonable  Or just to protect myself from fears and pains  Do I actually like that or do I just act like that to please others  Or to be left alone  Looking for the most convenient path instead of being courageous to wage something   And the worst thing is that it kills your personality  I don't have a inner voice anymore  I feel absolutely empty and clueless 
Start by really immersing yourself in something or things you are good at  Whatever that is  Cooking  making music  art  science  whatever  And always praise your own results  Then try one new thing that you think you'll be good at  and you'll be surprised how quickly your confidence grows   Confidence comes from being accepting and knowledgeable about yourself  You can't be confident when you don't like yourself or are imitating other people to create some kind of identity  Don't care what other people think  Their thoughts are just a tiny little voice in their own head that you can't hear  so they might as well be thinking nothing  By thinking they are thinking bad of you  you are thinking for them putting words in their head that aren't there  and chances are  you're way off base   Confidence doesn't come naturally to some people  myself included  it takes time and work and motivation to step a little outside your comfort zone  Thinking you can't do something is the exact reason why you should try and do it  Failures happen  accept some things are just not for you and learn from it   Example  didn't think I would ever get a good education  I am now halfway through my law degree   Failed at zumba classes  Terribly  Everyone was in perfect synchronised dancing harmony and there was me sweating like a pig and flailing around like a crazy woman  Totally humiliating  Will never go again  Note to self   group weight loss activities are not for me  Take up swimming  I love water lol  
Thank you so much for replying I really appreciate it I guess that i feel like a bad mother for not being strong enough and letting myself breakdown and cry  I have to be a rock but im not that strong and i just want to be the best for my kid   I hear what you say about conquering demons  Maybe this person was not the one i needed to keep on becoming a better human  I am taking my medication regularly and feel better  I will make a doctors appointment tomorrow to talk about treatment and join a support group  I really want to get well and overcome these feelings  Thank you for listening   
Tell her  I am assuming you have not been diagnosed by a professional and you should seek help  I have told my parents  friends  wife  kids and they accept it  My wife keeps an eye on my pulling away and brings me back  She feels like she failed in your relationship  you need to tell her it isn't her  and it isn't really you either  You may not get all that laughter back but I think you will see at least some  You will both feel better  oh and talk about it every once in awhile  
I'm so sorry that you're having such a hard time  Looking back to when I switched from being on Citalopram for years to Prozac  I truly don't know how I made it out alive  Do you by chance have a therapist counselor that you can talk to as well 
Thank you    I think you both are lovely and amazing people  Really  you have made a difference today in my day and state of mind  Big hugs and thank yous 
Alcohol and marijuana  I stopped taking Ativan after about a year and a half  every day every other day  small amounts  last August  since then I've taken it twice 
It really does  hopfully the first day will be the worst and then it'll feel a bit more predictable  
How do I bring this up with my doctor 
My girlfriend and I had a beautiful boy together on Dec  23rd  but she wanted to give him up for adoption and I cancelled it  I want to be his father but she's so upset she's taken the kid away to her parents house and her dad will not let me visit either of them    I have done all the legal actions I can  but they take a lot of time  A lot of time for me to realize how I lost my partner in the universe and my son in the same decision  I feel like I'm doing the right thing but God every minute of it hurts and feels very lonely  I'm glad and lucky that I have a supportive family to lean on right now   Just wanted to vent cause it's hard to talk about  thanks for reading 
I'm just wondering  are you mad that you lost a friend or are you mad cuz you had feelings for her 
I'm no expert but exercise  good sleep pattern  eat healthy  be around postive people  stay away from drink and illegal substances   Edit also have learnt all the above are hard to do in the deep darkest days of depression

Parties are dumb  Dates are dumb  Not having a driving licence  Doesn't matter 
This is how my life played out as well  carefree and ignorant child  but grew up alone year after year  I thought it would get better  but now I know better not to be optimistic  We're all alone 
That's great  I hope it works out for you  I've been thinking about going to see the doctor because it's not getting better and I don't think I can get out of it on my own  I'm a little worried about side effects  I guess I won't know until I ask  
That sucks  Go to another pharmacy 
lol we're all to anxious to join 
My mom told me to kill myself yesterday and no matter how hard I try to work up the courage to do it  I fail  What's wrong with me 
  many people seem to ignore it right away   This is directly attributable to the pharma corps and medical community telling people the only way is through a pill  it's slowly changing but good god that change is slow    Anyway  cheers for posting and sourcing all of this I might link back to your post when the need arises if that's ok   
I'm the same way  and my nurse says it's common 
No  I've never thought that  Why the fuck would you kill someone just so you can die  If you really want to die so badly  you can do it without taking the life of someone else who has nothing to do with your situation 
You're describing what sounds like 'white coat hypertension'  I have the same problem   it's where your blood pressure rises due to anxiety being in the presence of a doctor or nurse a healthcare environment or if you're thinking about it too much  and increased heart rate will raise blood pressure  As long as your blood pressure is 140 90 or below after you start to relax  you can be assured that you don't have any issues with your blood pressure  it's just you being anxious  I have to tell whoever does my blood pressure that I have white coat hypertension  It's not embarrassing  it's very common  Try and take deep  slow breaths    
I have a Mazda as a project car  and my dad has a mazda too  They're bad ass cars if you want luxury or rice  I'm so sorry  I hope you can find a second love
 Since then I have spoken with the police  and they have stated that they are aware of the situation and referred me to a victims advocate  Not much help there  The hard part is walking away from everything  My home  my dogs  all my belongings  It's just a really messed up situation     u lmt0311  Im very glad you are getting out of the situation  Im so very sorry for what you have been through  I do recommend checking with the victims advocate to see if there are free therapy sessions available  It can be a big help  Im sorry you dont feel supported  I do understand that the cops can unfairly target the male when the female party is the abuser  However  it does sound to me that they believe you here  I dont know if that helps  Ultimately  the only person that can get you moving forward is you  I dont see if you are married  How about the apartment  Do you rent  Are you on the lease agreement  If so  it may be necessary for you to ask for a restraining order against her  She isnt going to stop the back and forth  And the order may help with the landlord letting you out of the lease    Taking the steps to leave is the beginning  You have done that  Now it takes one step at a time to move forward  Keep your eye on the ball  Be kind to yourself  Sleep well  rest  exercise  eat well   Find a place to live  And block her in all forms  the texts  calls  email  etc  Please actively block her  That allows you to rest and not be anxious over her next contact with you at her will    Please also take a look at the resources in our sidebar  They are out there  Please reach out and take a look  You have done the hardest part  which is to leave  Now you need to stay gone and move forward in a healthy manner  One step at a time  OP  You can do this 
It can be a challenge  But we all gotta be here for one another  The inspiration is key     feel free to message me if you ever wanna talk  
Once I had the beer the effect of the alcohol just felt amplified  I felt extremely drunk  without any kind of sick or full feeling from the over consumption typically required for this  and have no memory of the ride home nor of going to bed    If you are curious about the medication alone  it's a high without euphoria if that makes any sense 
You know what works better than anti depressants and usually take 1 2 weeks to work  The "medeterian diet" basically all fruits and veggies and no red meat  Natural vitamins is the best way to balance the chemicals in your brain  Stay away from processed foods and all forms of sugar  eat home cooked meals only  I guarantee this life style will change your mood rapidly after a couple weeks 
I've had very similar experiences for the past 6 months  What was thought to be lymes was actually Mononucleosis  I had some severe physical and mental side effects that are similar to what Lyme's people get   The mental is the scariest  A lot of my reading is that the mental side effects is due to over inflamation of the body due to the immune system trying to fight the infection  Both mono  which is EBV  and Lyme's are a medium term illness that takes time clean up   I had everything you describe and then some  The best advice I can give is eat well  eat antifungal and anti inflammatory foods  drink lots of water and exercise  By exercise I mean just small walks here and there  Also  real coconut oil has some serious health benefits  Major studies show it's simply amazing stuff   My wife takes buspirone for anxiety  She tried others and they all make her loopy as well  This seems to actually work and she loves it  It's very easy on you  The first 45 mins after taking she is dizzy  I'd recommend this    Good luck and be patient  This too shall pass   
Oh don't get me wrong buddy  my boyfriend isn't understanding  He used to tell me not to worry all the time but now just accepts the fact that I will anyway  He is calming in the sense that he is a calm  laid back person by nature and it rubs off on me in the way that being in a hospital when you're ill makes you feel safer even though you've been given no treatment yet    I drive him mad with my bouts of insecurities about the relationship  I can be very needy and clingy and constantly asking him to reassure me that he isn't going to break up with me  I over think absolutely everything  and see all the grey areas   Whereas he is logical and sees things very black and white   But  I'm almost 33 years old  I've had one marriage and a fair few long term relationships since I was 16  but I think this guy is my first proper love  It is unconditional from both of us  That's what you need to find  not nessecarily someone who will understand your anxiety  but someone who just accepts you for who you are and won't try and change you    I refuse to let my anxiety be the focal point of anything in my life  In my relationship  we make sure we focus on what we have in common and just deal with my anxiety like a cold  Embrace it when it comes  work through it and push back to normality  It's not easy at all and has nearly broke us up more than once  But it's not getting to take away the only thing that keeps me sane these days   Eta  thank you for pointing out the once a week thing  Cos if I had my way I'd see him every day  This is overwhelming for him as he loves indulging in his hobbies and keeping up his relationships outside of ours  Friends and family for example  I know I'm being irrational  that's anxiety for you  and it's nice to hear other people say we're doing just fine at once a week   It's reassuring   Your ex sounds like a bit of a selfish shit if you ask me  which has nothing to do with you or your anxiety  She just isn't made of strong stuff to handle people like us lol but you will find someone who is  Just don't stop trying xx
Go somewhere else  They come a dime a dozen 
You should be proud of yourself first of all  Losing weight is a huge thing  You set a goal  you worked HARD for 3 years  THAT is a big deal  It's hard  because we live in a social media world  people are always posting about the "new me" and we see that and think that's how it's supposed to be  I guarantee if you posted your before and after on social media  people would for SURE give you props  Not saying it's the most important thing  but a little praise does wonders for confidence    I understand not feeling good enough  I've struggled with that my entire life  People think I'm confident  athletic and strong willed  but I secretly struggle with not being good enough  But having a little fake confidence can help  Use this weight loss a stepping stone  Go on Tinder  Match and all that stuff  There are millions of women out there  dating is a numbers game  Go on as many dates as you can  and it will stick  Again  the fake confidence will help   Good luck to you man  Congrats on your 3 year journey  Keep making goals and keep inspiring people  
If you really can't tell your parents  I suggest trying to make an appointment with your primary care doctor  You can tell the PCP how you're feeling  and they'll be able to point you in the right direction  They will probably also be able to call your parents and explain the situation to them  and hearing it from a doctor will make them take it more seriously  Doctors are your friends  That's just my suggestion   
The longer you wait   and the more you take   the harder it will be to stop  Getting anxious when you stop isn't just a reflection of emotional addiction  it's part of the physiological process of withdrawal  In my experience  this process gets all tangled up in BP patterns and swings  It's touchier for us than for most people to come off opiates   I'd recommend getting accountable  with your husband  a GP  a therapist  or someone else  If there isn't anyone you can open up to in your life  think about hitting a 12 step meeting or join us at r OpiatesRecovery  
I've been at this for 21years of my life  I fully understand what it takes to live with depression  And even I remind myself that I am powerful  Because that's what we are  Powerful  To live with this shit and keep marching  Keep at it one day one hour one minute  You'll get there  I find it really helps to have a goal that isn't impossible 
Can you elaborate  A job  A person 
I do these hourly checkins with myself using a scale 110  Based on events in my life from very happy safe to terrified  This helps me know if I am headed towards an episode which could last days  And can pull out if it before it is too late when using this method  I have been using this method for 6 months and to my knowledge  have clear  I also wearing an earring that I associate with my gf  I have a clinical dx of PTSD   Aspergers
Don't buy so much when you go to the supermarket  only get what you need and make a few changes in your diet  switch out the junk for healthier options  I'm not saying this will cure your depression  but eating healthier will certainly make you feel better and more energetic 
This type of thing is a numbers game   You have to communicate with many people   Otherwise all your eggs are in one basket   I have done this because I have met people by chance also  in classes  working in a camp  and then when those were over  I was alone   But it was still on me to continue socializing

I was fortunate enough to get several years off the pills but I feel your pain  I got myself to the doctor today and got a prescription of celexa and feeling so much more hopeful  I was really downtrodden there  I hope you find a solution  xanax and alcohol definitely aren't manageable for non stop bouts of this anxiety  Best of luck  
If you can manage to do it without the help of medication  exercise   Exercise  sleep  good food    Edit   What u throwawayagain0101 said

But what if you feel like you lost your passion 
I always suffer from being able to move on  I usually get crushes on someone and something happens  and I have to cut them out of my life  Eventually I 'get over" them  even though they always have a piece of my heart  But I do stop thinking about them constantly 
Well done  Proud of you  that's a big step  Sertraline has really helped me  Give it some time to work and I hope it makes you feel better too  Good luck with it 
Am i the only one who is not even able to cry anymore  I haven't genuinely cried in 2 years  My emotions are too numb for that   
what is was your passion  
I'm moronic and dangerous  Otherwise  I wouldn't be posting to reddit for some hope of mental help  Did you read the post  My title is true based on my situation  If you have it better then good for you  bud  I already hate myself plenty  I don't need your help 
I ate raw chicken  in the center  and never got sick  I did it more than once  You'll be fine 
Write out a list of all of your achievements since you've worked there  ie  Running the place on your own  customer service  stock checks  management etc etc   Demand a meeting with HR Management and tell them  Give them the list  Let then see how much of a great employee you are    Failing this   1  Brush up your CV  Include every bit of applicable experience in that thing 2  Get that CV out online and begin looking 3  Land another job elsewhere  preferably higher paid with better perks    CV is resume in England    I'm sorry it's not what you wanted to hear probably   The last job I had was good when I started and I realised that my bulimia and depression were spiralling down a huge hole  I was moody  Angry  Every single day  People would laugh and joke with me and I'd snap  and the only thing that kept me going was that paycheck    I left last month and it's amazing how better I feel now  I get paid more  Commute less  I wake up wanting to go to work  well  not really  but who does       Your supervisor is a fucking dick  I respect you for not hospitalising her  I really do  You seem like such a genuine  kind person  Fuck that bitch  
I understand that you are nervous and it's okay to be nervous before a first date  I was in the same seat about 2 months ago so I feel your pain  For me personally my stomach hurt on the way to the date because I was so nervous  but once I met her and we started talking it wasn't that bad  The build up is the worst part  the actual date is not that bad    If it makes you feel better he is probably at home right now thinking the same things as you for example "should I offer to pay "  Also remember that he  wants  to meet you  take that as a positive thing and let it make you excited   As far as paying and what not it's pretty easy in your situation since I'm assuming that he asked you out and that you are a girl  If he offers to pay and you want him to pay then let him pay  If he doesn't offer to pay  pay for your own stuff  If he goes in for the kiss then do what you feel is right  If you want to kiss then do it  if you don't tell him you aren't ready   Good luck I'm rooting for you   
Are you male  I cry a LOT around my period  but not at all the other couple weeks 
Let's see  I hate touching anything in a public restroom  gas pumps  my shoes  certain door handles  anything that's been on the floor ground  gas cap on my car  garbage cans and bags  I'm sure there's some I'm missing  I also have to wash my hands before I use the bathroom  as I'm afraid of transmitting herpes HIV to myself from touching an object 
I have a therapist and a pdoc both and they know I have started taking them  I guess I just need some help  and that sucks  
I'm sorry you're having such a hard time  Exercise is by no means a complete answer  especially in treatment resistant depression  since there are so many different variables in life   That being said  exercise is the single intervention that has had  the greatest effect  on my depression  However  in my life and probably in yours too  it is only a piece of the puzzle   Everyone is different but learning to live with and even thrive in spite of my depression has been a long and ongoing journey  Some of the tools that have been useful to me in the context of building life enhancing practices into my life one at a time     daily exercise  at least half of it outdoors    daily meditation and at least weekly group meditation    good diet  emphasizing vegetables  plant proteins  fatty fish  fruits  and fats from nuts avocado olive oil and minimizing sugar  wheat  alcohol  and dairy    weekly therapy     antidepressants    supplements including vitamins  probiotics  fish oil  and rhodiola    novelty at least weekly if possible e g  trying a new activity  going a new place  meeting a new person    creative outlets such as journaling  art  music    social interaction at least weekly e g  hiking with friends  board games with friends  can be combined with novelty     purpose  such as thinking about ways your career is important to the world  planning for a shift to a future career that feels purposeful to you  or engaging in volunteering hobby caregiving that brings you some kind of purpose or deeper meaning  can be combined with social interaction     Together all of these might seem like a giant to do list  and sometimes they feel like that  But I also know that taken all together  they make my life much more enjoyable to experience  By implementing them one at a time and building  they feel much more manageable  The list might not look exactly the same for you  but it might be a starting place    Feel free to PM  I have been living with depression for a long time and am always happy to listen

Thank you so much for responding with this  Despite all the crap I've been posting to this reddit to get it out of my system  reading what you've written actually made me feel a bit proud somehow  Proud  instead of something just suffering and being beaten into the dirt   I also really like this cartoon  It's really amazing  to me  I think I'll print it out and put it somewhere I'll see it all of the time 
Thanks for the replies  I'm relieved to see that it's common  My doctor seemed very surprised when i told him and he said that it could only raise a tiny bit 
I cannot agree more regarding the pharma and medical community  I hope that I will be able to do something about it in my lifetime   It would be my honor if you linked back to my post      Thanks for your input  much appreciated  
I feel like   I should be able to talk her out of it  But obviously that's not going to happen 
yea found that out when i woke up today  Masturbation in general helps though 
Haha  thanks Dr  Hooha  Are you by any chance an OB GYN

well  the thing is  i used chicken that were one day past the 'sell by' date in the package  just plain thin chicken cutlets for chicken parm  when i opened them  they didnt smell or look slimy   a couple other people i asked said i should be fine too  but this lovely emeto brain is like 'but lets not NOT freak out just yet'
It's probably because your subconscious is portraying how you want to be happy  because in reality you aren't happy  I'm not very knowledgeable when it comes to dreams  but I'm sure that's what it means   There is a person in my life who makes me very unhappy  When this person was in my dream  we were very happy together  I dreamt of this not because it will come true  it's because it's what I desire 
Just delete it  I don't have Facebook  Haven't had it in years  I can tell you speaking from experience it's certainly not "weird" to not have it  Be proud your not addicted to something so superficial anyway  
I don't have any off the top of my head tips for how to reduce this   But if you sweat a ton from your underarms  get Certain Dri  the roll on   You only apply it at night  and not very frequently  but really can help if you excessively sweat to the point you're embarrassed by it 
Yeah exactly  Don't come running to us when your life goes tits up 
Yeah  I guess she was making me happy and when we stopped talking that much and that often it had a big effect on me  
I've had pleasant surprise with my first pill  escitalopram   it worked immediately  I guess my condition wasn't too severe and or autosuggestion of receiving support worked wonders  But taking the pill took some ego fighting
Should be fine  Sell by and use by are different dates  
I understand how it's super difficult to look for another job while recovering rom daily labor   However it looks like that's what you gotta do   Sorry  that sucks   
Just you wait untill we have technology to scan outselves and USE VR to drink together     
You've basically described my whole life  I even ended up in a hospital  because my GP measured my blood pressure during the check up and it was so bad she told me to go straight to the hospital  Few hours later  after ECG and several blood tests  everything came out clear and I went back home  Don't worry about this too much  Perhaps you could work a bit on your anxiety and try some calming techniques  You could buy blood pressure measuring device and try checking it at home yourself as a form of desensitization

I've been a vegetarian for a year now  and I cannot confirm your "guarantee"  I'm sorry  I wish just eating something else could cure depression  but unfortunately it doesn't work that way   Also  OP  good luck  I've yet to come to the point where I can persuade myself to take medication  do anything  honestly 
I'm kinda in the same place as you at the moment  and would suggest going to your family doctor  a walk in clinic  anyone you feel comfortable talking to  You can even talk to me anonymously if you like  From there  people will direct you to resources that are more specific to your situation   You can also take this test  http   patient info doctor patient health questionnaire phq 9  sorry I have no idea how to link this in a fancy way   It's a good one  everyone's been making me take it
Good for you  taking steps to get better 
there wasnt a use by date on the package  just sell by 
I would say there's more than likely a few things going on with Chuck  but I do believe there is a basis of OCD behavior  especially how he gets sick from things  has these compulsive behaviors to prevent the bad things from happening etc    obviously as is with anything  there is embelishment  But so far it's been an interesting interpretation 
You "sound" pretty normal to me  I don't want to insult or anything  but after being in such hell you can't just randomly get a "good job" and marry a man "of your dreams"      A anyway  if what you wrote is true  i don't think you can do anything that will be of real use  Seems like you have everything you want right now  at this point only time will grind the memory  you only need to keep yourself busy and  despite what a shitty road you had  you are at a very good point right now      And yes talking about it  but only sometimes  is a right way to go  Because talking about it will bring back memories and you should   "feel" how you react to it  If its too bothering   try it later  The more mundane undisturbing those thougts are   the better 
And you would know better than OP's doctor  Solid suggestion if someone came here looking for non medical options  not sarcasm   but that's not what OP came here for  You don't know anything about OP's background or medical history  Don't try to say that a diet that may have worked for you or anyone you know will be better for someone you don't know anything about 
Ohhhh  I totally get where you're coming from  and I can imagine a sales career would be especially difficult when you're suffering from clinical anxiety   I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder  And while my anxiety can be triggered by a variety of things  my professional life has proven to be the most common and significant trigger  It's such a theme over the course of my adult life    I believe it comes back to associating my self worth with my work performance  and the opinions of my co workers  The later of which I truly can't control    My therapist has recommended scheduling "off" time  which sounds intuitive but is incredibly difficult  Don't check email when you're home or on the weekends  And make it a point to try  so much easier said than done  to avoid work thoughts while at home    She's told me visualize a stop sign when I begin to experience cognitive distortions  like black and white thinking  She's also suggested reframing things into an "annoying" category  ie  this person who keeps emailing me less than pleasant things is just an annoyance  not a threat to my self worth    One of her other suggestions was to "schedule" my worry time  So  maybe Sundays from 2 to 3 are when I'm going to sit around and consider all the bad things that are about to happen     The rest of the week  it's just not the time for it    Recognizing when a thought is a cognitive distortion has been the most helpful  I can kind of say  'OK  that's the anxiety talking '  All this is so much easier said than done  I think anyone reading this sub gets that  
We really don't know how bad it will be  maybe we'll want to make it  I wish that we all make it

Thanks  Although I actively worked on it for years  there were times when I thought of giving up entirely   Going to a dentist used to be very traumatic experience say about 7 years ago  I'm never afraid of my teeth pulled out but the small talk I had to surely make  This is where I started  But didn't want it to define my future  Recovery started when I found out there were others that are going through the same thing  and that it has a name   I'm happy because right now  I am travelling and using AirBnB and hostels  not for financial reasons but just to cement my recovery  and just thinking about how else I can improve my life   The everyday flashes of SA are far fewer and don't last that long  they are very good reminders on how far I have come 
I think this is something I wanna do  Brilliant idea    probably an app in there somewhere too   
I would be gone long ago if it wasn't so hard to commit suicide  
Attempting to scare individuals into staying away from or stopping medication is entirely inappropriate here  Depression is a medical condition and no one here is qualified to treat it  that is what medical professionals are for  That is why we do not allow anyone to advocate for or against specific treatments    If you want to discuss the efficacy of a certain class of drug  or a specific drug  there are subreddits where it is appropriate to do so  such as  r science   r psychology  or  r psychiatry   This subreddit is here for peer support for those struggling with depression

I can relate  I am also unemployed at the moment  I got screwed over  I have a job interview tomorrow  so hope that turns a new leaf  I was in college last spring  My options for girls dwindled after leaving  as if there were too many at the little technical college I went to  Not having a job  trust me  makes depression so much worse  We sit at home  sleep  wake up  and repeat  It makes you feel worthless  and it makes having bills and loans to pay even worse  Luckily I had a good stack of cash when I fell under unemployment  Hopefully things change for me and you friend 
Honestly  I think you did everything fine  I'm in the same boat at 24 and I was in a  somewhat  similar situation   I was talking with some coworkers  one being my crush  and at one point the conversation turned into past relationships  when the attention was on me I flat out said I've never had a girlfriend before  They gave me weird looks and my crush re blurted my statement  "you've never had a girlfriend  "  I was just being honest and in situations like this it really makes me proud of my best quality  and maybe a month or two later we went out  Not really a date so much but we both had fun   Of course I would maybe wait or never bring it up if you don't have want to  but you were sort of pinned into an answer  In short I believe honesty is one of the best traits you can have  and really claiming it to be who you are is a great feeling 
I have to run out of the house for the next few hours but if you send me a pm ill make sure to get back to you then  Stay strong friend 
Just know what meds don't have any crazy side effects  They can make the anxiety worse for the first 4 6 weeks but the overall effects are less worse than the crippling anxiety  I would suggest giving it a try  I'm on Zoloft  75mg and I'm kinda in the middle of figuring out the right dosage and brand  
It's a possibility  but it sounds like you just might be asexual

I fall into it sometimes  I'm mostly depressive though  but sometimes I end up with a sweet  expensive leather journal when I know I like typing better    It might be that you don't have much money to begin with because you're spending a butt ton of it    I'm gonna try out recognizing that I'm manic and not making purchases then  I hope you find a way out of it  
I'm a little confused by this thread  did a part of it get deleted  Judging by the context of the comments  it sounds like you ate raw chicken that was a day past the sell by  So  it's worth noting that sell by is bumped up by a lot of days because the manufacturer would rather play it safe and not risk lawsuits from people dabbling too close to the sell by  I'd say most items have at least four to six days past their sell by  raw meats  anyway    I've also seen a lot of people eat chicken that was still pink in the center and didn't get sick  but I wouldn't do it every day  It's definitely a game of Russian Roulette  you know   You'll probably be fine  But to answer the question  it really depends on the type of bacteria you've ingested  I've had foods that sickened me as short as within 4 hours of eating and I've had foods that sickened me about a day and a half later  at least  if I'm sure that I know what it was that made me sick  sometimes we just never really know  I've only had it a handful of times in my life though  so I mean  it really doesn't happen as often as our emeto brain makes us think  It's easier each time  too  Kind of like childbirth 
Hell yeh man  That shit can last forever  and barely go away with meds if it's rough enough  I just started taking nexium again I feel great until I wake up  I usually take it at 6 before dinner and by the time I'm up at 6 I'm feelin pretty shitty again  And it's a 24 hour drug too    Also your heart probably ain't racing  Or picks up after you think of it  It can also make your esophagus flutter right at the connection between stomach and throat  Or so I have been told by my GI doctor  Which is scary as shit cause you insta think it's heart then freak out    But if you want man  Do you have a Patient First near you  We have them outside Philadelphia  They can do a walk in ekg  That will show if you have a serious issue or not  And doctors can hear bad heart signs just by listening with a stethescope  I like to think doctors are twats most the time  But I realize more and more how they actually know a lot more then what I've learned thru dr  House and web md    But if you need it  Get an ekg and have them print the results for you  And keep them on you or posted some where you see daily  Just keep showing it to yourself    I have had acid reflux since October 4th 2010 tho bro  I keep a food journal and I try to combat my bad foods as much as possible  But you can't live without pizza it's impossible    One love

I absolutely don't scare individual to stay away from medication  In facts I only advise to change class of antidepresants   I only advise to stay away from an overrated  proved ineffective and proved to cause permanent damages worst than depression  ie pssd  class of medication called SSRI SNRI   Than you anyway  I will post message also in those subreddit 
Why  You must be very good to be training professionally  is it just kind of like me  that you dont really see the point anymore  Or something else  
Sorry you are going through this  You didn't do anything to deserve this unprofessional treatment  This pharmacist has taken it on himself to overrule an order from your doctor  e g  the new prescription    I also encourage you to go somewhere else  Loyalty and emotional connection to a small business is great  but you deserve to be treated with dignity and respect  The pharmacist's behavior here is unethical on several levels  
It just doesn't feel the same anymore  And like you said yourself  I'm not proud of my work  I felt ashamed every time I had to play for my classes  I'm just so disastrously lost 
Yeah the combination of the two is overwhelming  I want it to end so desperately  
Usually I think it's within 48 hours of the sell by date with chicken  With milk I think you get a week after the sell by  If it said use by yesterday  it still probably wouldn't have been a big deal  If it smelled ok and you cooked it to temp  you're A OK  D
I understand  Your only options is to confront  complain  or change 
Hmm  possibly doing something meaningful 
Back and biceps today  Looking forward to getting back into my routine but it's been hard lately  Too many excuses    Kinda put off the gym past few days  Fell into that vicious cycle of temporary distractions that don't better me at all  rather that actually working towards happiness    But it's all progress    baby steps  right  
No matter how bad times have gotten for me I always come out of the stress and anxiety even for a little bit and that reminds me of what life is like without anxiety  I can't say that our situation is the same but I think we all have a little bit of hope of what life could hold for us without this thing  I know for me it may take a long time  maybe years before I'm free but its taking it one step at a time  Life is worth living  
I'm positive about my relationship  Mostly  He can't handle it when it's at its worst  The worst it's ever been is once I texted him and told him I was gonna kill myself  He didn't message me for three days cos he needed space to think  I spent the first night in hospital and the next two days going out of my mind with worry about him  Not only did he let me down at my worst time  he made it worse by abandoning me for days afterwards   If there's one thing you don't do to someone with anxiety is give them the silent treatment and leave them alone with their own thoughts   It took me weeks to forgive him for that and he was sincerely apologetic  I've only had an episode like that once and never since  hopefully I won't again  Everything else in my life I'm not so chirpy  I could be a better mum  even though everyone tells me I'm just fine   my house is constantly a mess and I'm hanging onto my degree by the skin of my teeth and my finances are all over the place  Everything else is chaos   Your ex just seems incredibly immature  You might have thought nothing was wrong but she'd probably been thinking about it a while  My husband left me for someone else when I thought everything was getting better and going well  It took me three years to get over it  I tried to have a relationship in that time but I was just numb and dead inside  even for my own kids  I cared for them  and hugged them and read them stories but inside I was like a void  Just going through the motions xxx
Looked up lead poisoning and from the symptoms  It looks like I have it  Thx user  p  
Hey Panda  It's going to take some weeks before you feel the effects so don't write of the Sertaline if you feel better in the first few days then down after   I'd also like to state that Sertaline is an SSRI  which means that it is a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor   It won't magically produce Serotonin  the "happy" neurotransmitter  but the Sertaline will maintain a concentration of Serotonin in the synapse   Once you start feeling consistently better and feel like you have the energy to do so  it is important that you get sunlight  proper sleep  exercise  and eat foods containing tryptophan   This will ensure you maintain a proper supply of serotonin   Since the SSRI prevents the reuptake of serotonin  there is increased opportunity for the serotonin in the synapse to be broken down by enzymes   If the neurotransmitter is broken down  it can't be recycled through reuptake   Medicine provides the alleviation of symptoms  allowing you to improve all aspects of your life   I wish you the best of luck 
"Trying to focus more on myself rather than others"  This    Actually one of my revelations and resolutions for this year  Not in a selfish way  but in a healthful way  I e    in a conversation for example  instead of saying what I think that particular person wants to hear or will make them laugh   happy  I say how I'm feeling   even if it may be unpopular  One example of a broader concept 
Its nice to see people that can relate and provide understanding  I hope you get that job  Good luck

I was scared taking mine for the first time too  You probably won't feel any effects for a few days  It works fairly slowly  but if you find the right medicine  you may have to switch a few times  and the right dose  it makes a world of difference  I'm proud of you  and you should be proud of yourself  too     
That's a difficult place to be       Sounds like  even though everything in your wants to do  something   there's really nothing you can do in a tangible sense   It's at these points that all you can do is send positive energy  or whatever spiritual terms you follow  to your friend and hope that she stabilizes safely   Regardless  it really sucks you're in this position   I'm glad you posted here and hope you find some comfort in the replies 
I can't tell you what to do  but don't be too hard on yourself just because this stems from something mental instead of from a physical illness  Take care of yourself   If you didn't go on the trip  what would you do instead  Would you use that time for self care to set yourself up to do well with your class after they return from the trip  Would you regret skipping the trip  Would you be relieved 
It's amazing really  how heavy a heart can feel when it's been weighted down by depression  
Talk to your doctor about long lasting benzodiazepines  Take them lowest dose possible no more than 3 times a week   Talk to you doctor about SSRI  
Dude  We literally wake up blind and have to put plates of glass in front of our eyes to keep from walking into things  If anything that makes me feel worse than everyone else  and contributes to my low self esteem and literal depression  not a depressed feeling I get from assuming others' dispositions based on their appearance  Edit  please tell me this is a joke 
Thank you for this post  texts with sources are the best  I had heard of most of these studies and concepts and I have tried different diets before  Gluten free diet helps my IBS noticeably but sadly it doesn't seem to prevent depressive episodes  I am on mobile so I can't link right now  but have you heard of the claim that rice and corn are cross reactants  I hope that is the word   to gluten  so they should also be eliminated from the diet if one wishes to be truly gluten free  What do you think of this    Also I would love to hear about the other factors that help you manage your mood  Which medications have you found the most helpful in your case  
Thanks 
Hey it's never too late to change  There are many people in similar situations  and many of them will still get somewhere  while others won't  it's up to you  Concentrate on your future  past doesn't exist anymore 
Hi FoxesBadgers   Thank you for your very detailed reply  I'll take some time to look through the resources    I'm sorry to hear that you experienced similar issues  I sort of devised a coping mechanism of trying to ignore the overall situation when I lived in Mum's house  but now that it's happening a second time around it feels more difficult to not let it upset me  Visiting family over Christmas and seeing silly things like empty tables makes me cry and scream a little bit inside out of sheer frustration sometimes    I appreciate that hoarding and OCD are different things   Mum does also exhibit various parts of OCD also  which is the bit that outsiders notice  washing hands an excessive amount of times  boiling everything before use  etc   so I suppose I've often lurked mostly OCD content online on the past  I'll certainly check out the specific forums though   I do understand that to her the reasoning must be very real and important  indeed that has always given me a fear of pushing too far  I think that she sort of acknowledges that she has a problem  the issue is though that if you suggest any form of help she just shuts you down immediately   even to the extent of walking or driving away from you  I'll be completely honest  as much as I try to convince her to get some help  I think it is extremely unlikely she ever will  and believe me  I have tried  and continue to do so   She may one day attempt some of the techniques  although a suggestion of that yesterday was met with a clear and final "no thanks"   She's also very bloody stubborn     It does help to know that we're not the only ones out dealing with this issue though  I personally am going through a bit of a dark patch with it at the moment  but keep smiling and hoping  I'm going to have a look through some of your links now  and to the hoarding forums   Many thanks again 
I've somewhat experienced what you describe  on days where i attempt this "fasted exercising" i hear people getting results from   It just doesn't work for me  I feel nauseous  light headed  and it gets me into panic mode because i just don't feel right   As your PT is suggesting  i'd agree diet could be a contributor   Try starting the day with proper breakfast  For me  bacon and eggs is my go to  Good essential proteins and fats  low carbs  I'll generally get hungry again an hour or two later  where i'll have some muesli or oats or some form of low gi carbohydrate   Then with this in my system  an hour or two later i'll hit the gym   Good luck  Everyones body responds to nutrient timing differently  i hope you find your balance   
Be careful  I self medicate with food and totally let myself go the past few years and can't believe how heavy I am now  It's so hard to resist  food is always there when you need it  not like friends or other things that are out of your control  It's not a good trade off in the end though  once you don't like how you look and clothes don't fit  then it's just something else to be depressed about  
Anxiety has destroyed my life as well  im a shell of a person tbh  I've grown apart from my friends  relationships with opposite sex go nowhere fast  I've made little improvements using meds and exercise but the damage is done  I recommend trying different medications asap  also  cut out all caffeine from your life  work out daily

Yes  but not so much these days  I've learned the hard way like you just did that 'dwelling' on simple moments like this is just so much more painful then to  not think  and say something   The way I think about it is almost like  would I rather feel like an idiot now and just get it over with  or think about how much of an idiot I'll be and then feel it ten times worse  I've only recently begun feeling better and even proud at times about who I am  and how far I've come with dealing with SA  and I can tell you it only gets better with time

I don't know if he has OCD per se but he definitely seems to have some sort of anxiety disorder   Sometimes I think maybe he's just agoraphobic and he uses EMS as an excuse to stay in his house all day every day   
Klonopin helped me in many ways too but over time I noticed memory problems and overall sluggishness  I got off and it was hell  im still in withdrawals 4 months after getting off  now I have even worse anxiety than before I started kpins  pray you never have to get off
I currently take it but I also take it with setroline  The bupropion did initially cause some anxiety but after a while it leveled off  It also did give me some foggy feelings as far as thinking clearly and which was a struggle since I was in college at the time 
I take it as needed for GAD and panic disorder and have found it to be a great way to stop the build up of days and days of anxious thought    So I do a few days on  a few days off  using just 1 mg a day  And I've done that for a while now  with no issues 
no  i dont think so  i basically made dinner with chicken that was one day past the 'sell by' date   it didnt smell bad and didnt look slimy when i opened the package  but as it is poultry   im afraid of the risk for fp

Trust me  you wouldn't want it this way either  Don't get me wrong  she means the world to me  but that's also why it will always hurt  I've known her over 3 years  She liked me at one point  but ofc that was when I didn't really like her  She grew on me  and that's the worst part about it  Also  She's in NC  I'm stuck in Ohio   
I think i can relate and I'm sorry it feels hopeless OP  Does this sound familiar   You hear someone talking about when they "had" depression  like in the past tense  and you're like  "Lol wut you mean it went away  Hah yeah right "
It's not you  Good friends are almost impossible to find these days  I've known one friend for close to ten years now and we talk constantly and lately I've been realizing that as the holidays came around they haven't said anything to me in 3  weeks despite knowing how they are pretty much my only contact in the world  People just don't care  I suppose it's possible to overburden people if you were going overboard telling them about your problems  but they shouldn't give an open invitation like that then  Try not to take the behavior as others as a reflection of your own value  Them flaking out defines them as a friend and as a person  not you  
I don't think you should feel bad  especially if he knows you've got any sort of germophobia or emetophobia  He'll likely understand and tbh  he'd probably rather not have you see him in that condition  Best you can do is what Nosicknessplease said  clean the bathroom and take care of yourself  trust your immune system  but for mental comfort  have ginger ale and ginger tea on hand if only at least to fight the nausea  can't do much about the d  but let's be real  we'd probably all rather have d over v any day     Just let him be  and when he's well again  have a sit down and let him know you've got a pretty bad case of germophobia emetophobia and you want to be considerate and help where you can  but certain things are where you draw the line  but you'll do about anything else you can to help from a distance if need be  I'm sure he'll understand and getting the subject out in the open is maximum healthy for a relationship anyway  Especially germophobia emetophobia  like that should always be the first thing you let your SO know about in a relationship because they'll be less weirded out like  "did I offend her him " and more like  "oh must be the anxiety  well  I'll back up then give space "  You'll likely be ok  I was in a similar situation a few years back when my boyfriend was staying the night with me at my parents' house  I guess something he ate gave him really bad fp  I really think it was something he ate earlier  because literally none of us got sick and ate all the same stuff he did    he was lying in my room feeling miserable for a time  had already v'd and d'd a bit in the bathroom  and finally said he had to go home  I didn't have such severe emetophobia back then and actually stuck it out with him in the same room and used the same bathroom right after he did all that with no fear or issue  I'd probably never do that now  with the phobia being stronger today than it was back then    He ultimately drove himself home despite my best efforts to get him to stay and let me take care of him  He really didn't want me to see him in that state  like    he just really got embarrassed about all the sickness  I guess  He probably also preferred to be in a more comfortable and familiar setting  too  rather than stuck in the bathroom at his in law's house  you know    So he went home  and I never did get sick at all  no one did  even without bleaching the bathroom after    So you'll very likely be ok  Just talk it out when your boo's better and bleach clean what you can to ease your mind  Good luck 
How is your quality of life now 
When I was a child  I remember I had some moments of being happy  But when I started school  I moved around a lot and I would never fit in  I've carried this sadness and self loathing with me for years  My mom took me to a therapist once when I was 11  Only could do one session as our medical aid would not cover the expenses   Now I'm 30  Still living with this sadness  I wish I could have gotten the help when I was younger  I feel it's just too late for me  
It's not much  but I'm sending you internet hugs  You know you have a rough road ahead and you're brave for facing it  Use your resources  And tell your husband  Mine repeatedly tells me he would rather know when things are bad than have to guess  He has depression and anxiety too  and he tells me the guessing game is a bit of a trigger  Stay strong 
Guitar  From my own example  it helped me through some hard times 
Having a bad day today as well  please know you are not alone 
I've been down this road before with my finance courses  often finishing a project that I had 3 months to do in a day     Its a hard road but I just kept pushing myself knowing that it will be finished whether it will look good or not  Getting something done is really better than nothing in my opinion  Do your best and feel good about what you get done  not about how much you put the work off  Hope this helps a little
That's just messed up man
Thank you 
I think it was mostly the toxic relationship I had with my parents add to that the stress of school  and I've had two relationships which weren't good for me  I think the second one triggered this the most out of everything  She made me feel worthless  What about you 
Having a bit of a block in a creative passion isn't something to be ashamed of  It may just mean that you really care which is a quality that a great musician needs  Have you tried opening up to people in your classes 
I started taking antidepressants when I was in middle school and was on them through high school then on and off through my first two years of college  But now I'm starting to realize that antidepressants aren't for me so I've stopped taking them altogether and have resorted to things like yoga and making art when I feel a depressive episode coming on  
Seems like a middle ground option would be to try to discuss how you are feeling with your family  rather than just deciding to stop attending church and letting the consequences play out  or continuing to force yourself to go when you don't want to be there  It's not selfish to have your own identity and to realize when a certain environment doesn't feel right to you  Hopefully your family would only want you to be in attendance at church if that's what you are freely choosing to do  Being there by force or obligation doesn't accomplish much  like you said you're already messing with your phone the entire time    If your family isn't approachable like that were you could discuss this feeling with them  then you may have to just do what feels right for you and deal with the consequences  You can try to encourage your brother to keep attending and not follow in your footsteps  Tell him you are just taking some time away to decide how you feel about it and that he should keep going  
If it lasts for weeks  months  or even years  it's overwhelmingly likely to be a symptom of an anxiety disorder  I've had it on and off since I was a kid  Awful feeling  but if it were going to kill me  I would have been dead years ago  You're good 
I've been depressed most of my life  Lately I have made a lot of progress recognizing my depression for what it is but I still have bad days  Today is one of them  I also feel hopeless and unhappy but I rationally know that this too shall pass  So just know   you aren't alone  I'm here too and I'm sending you hugs and good vibes  Life is much better when you know you aren't alone  Xoxox
I'd say your risk is quite low  But my advice in these situations is  when your mind says you're very certainly going to be ill soon  and with emetophobia  the mind is always going off with that  the best thing to do is prepare for it  acquire all you can to weather the ordeal comfortably  I stock up on ginger tea and ginger ale as well as stuff to fight nausea  Peppermint tea helps too  Ginger candies rock  I get water  crackers  and easy to eat fruits like melon and grapes because I know if I get sick  that's all I'll be able to keep down  But the real star of the show is ginger everything   Sometimes just prepping helps ease my mind and then it turns out I don't get sick at all  So while I think you're going to be fine  if you really feel like it's coming and the anxiety won't quit  go out and get these things to ease your mind  because they really will make the experience less hellish 
I can't speak for Lexapro specifically  but I can say that the Sertraline I take can definitely make me feel ill if I miss a dose  but I've definitely never felt 'unstable'  I believe some people can experience negative symptoms because of antidepressants  but anything too serious  aside from allergic reactions  is very rare  As long as you keep your doctor informed about any possible side effects  everything should be fine  
Mindfulness  excersize  healthy food 
Yesterday I was half a day late on taking my 50 mg and I felt horribly sick  with nausea and vertigo  and wasn't sure if it was food poisoning or the medicine  Wow  this stuff really doesn't screw around when you forget it 
How you Doing man  What kinda pastries you make 
Then you're good    There is this cool website my grandmother pointed me to called stilltasty that will tell you how long things are good beyond their sell by or use by dates  Chicken was 1 2 days 
MIT OCW did me well for this 
Usually it just takes the willpower and discipline to decide to do something even when you don't feel like it  So many people think life is this game of being helpless until you find yourself in a better mood  until energy and motivation are just suddenly present some morning when you wake up  but in the meantime while you're just waiting for it to happen on its own you continue to exist in a low energy state of sitting around breathing stale air  and that isn't likely to lead to an increase in energy  More often what works is forcing yourself to get up and do what you need to do  even if you just go briskly walk around the block  and getting your heart pumping and some oxygen flowing to your brain will be the thing that actually makes you feel alive and snapped out of the funk    You're at the mercy of your biochemistry if you go through life waiting for moods to strike you  Instead you kind of have to drag your brain along for the ride  even if it's kicking and screaming that it doesn't want to  
For me  I don't think it's so much distraction just acknowledgement  Like  OK  this is my anxiety talking  Just accept the feeling and let it roll  acknowledge without engaging with the thought    Maybe try to track the times of day activities where your anxiety seems to be more prevalent  If you start to see specific patterns  then maybe employ distraction  Listen to music  go for a walk  grab lunch  read a book  watch something funny on Youtube  etc  
Yes switch therapists  Medication is a viable option to help you control depression  If your therapist isn't willing to explore all options  especially one that you wish to explore    change  therapy is about you   not the therapist 
I think what the above commenter is trying to say is that you have a right to feel what you are feeling  It's not a competition in that while I may have a hundred different reasons for feeling the way I do  and you only have 98  your feelings are still valid  Sometimes people's brains malfunction and don't produce enough of the chemicals that make us feel good  that means you don't need a concrete absolute reason  you need support and help  Just like someone who doesn't have enough iron in their blood  or the ability to produce insulin  You feel what you feel  not matter if there is a reason or not  You are a human and you have worth  You deserve to feel normal  You deserve the help and support and whatever it needs to bring you back to a level you are happy with  
Similat situation here but im not in school  I can't watch movies OT have much of a conversation with someone as mind is restless  adhhd mixed with depression is nasty  which comes first  hard to say  no clue how to fix this
I believe they can but I also think that depression itself can affect your memory 
Has your OCD been the same intensity for all three years  or have you been steadily getting better   
Have you considered that maybe you have developed an addiction to feeling negative towards yourself    It's like a fat person eating cake  They know it's bad for them but their brain will release dopamine by eating it to satisfy their addiction   I find a good thing to remember is that I am not my thoughts  If I am my thoughts  who is listening to them  Thoughts and feelings come and go like waves crashing and receding on a beach   It's futile to fight them and resist them  just as it's impossible to hold on to them forever  They will arise naturally  positive or negative  but the trick is to just observe them without judgement   If your thoughts are ranting and raving about negative things  pretend you are watching a child have a tantrum in the supermarket  You don't react  you just smile and know that their behaviour is just silly   If your thoughts become more positive and helpful  that's great  but trying to hold on them will prove just as futile   All anyone has is this current moment right now  this very point in time  All the past and all the future lives in the realm of imagination   So relax  Watch your thoughts rather than react to them  Smile at the negativity with detachment and embrace the positive ones just the same  Everything will be fine 
No  Don't listen to that bullshit 
I'm happy you found something that helps 
Try and make some small changes  Go for a walk around the block before you play video games  It might help 
thank you for the advice  I stopped going to a therapist when i still was young because they didn't know what to do anymore and financial issues  Unfortunatly i am really bad in groups or trusting anyone that i don't know  I also have a book that really helped me it's called "A man's search for meaning by viktor frankl"  i will try your book too  i found out on the internet that Ayahuasca or small dosage of MDMA can heal PTSD But i'm scared that I will go insane completely   
Do not kill yourself  Please  For me  Do  Not  I love you  Everyone here loves you  Please don't  
I know what you mean  I have been there so often with school  starting off ok and then failing later on  getting 20s and 30s on my midterms finals because even though I try to study  nothing sticks  That is a normal thing with depression  If you need to take some time off school  that's totally fine  It will get better  I promise  even if you don't believe that   I know saying it doesn't help  Would it feel a little less horrible if you knew you had time to get better    I took last semester off because I was failing from the third week due to symptoms  I have bipolar so I get really depressed but also manic   I am planning to go back soon and the time off has definitely been helpful even if I'm not perfect yet 
I am not depressed now because I take the pills 
 removed 
Hm  that could be an issue since I'm in school  I guess I'll just have to see    Thank you  Now I know I probably shouldn't give up on it right away if I react a little badly
Thanks again  So did medication play any role in your recovery  
We'll be thankful you can enjoy people's company and feel close to people to where you miss them when they go  I don't even have that so its ah very empty existence   empty for me  not lonely
Why don't you talk to your physician or psychiatrist instead of a dietician  
You know what  when you write it out I now understand what I'm feeling  Brain fog  That's exactly what it is  The other ones I feel as well  but brain fog is what breaks my brain in half  
The next step would be to seek a psychiatrist    Just look for one nearby and schedule an appointment   http   finder psychiatry org   https   www zocdoc com psychiatrists   They will listen to your problems and give you advice and if they suspect you have depression  they will prescribe antidepressants   Also  a psychiatrist will provide you a diagnosis so if you miss school  you can use your diagnosis to provide an excuse     Im going to my first psychiatrist appointment in a couple of weeks and I wish I had went sooner    I hope you see one too   
It was the worst experience  I know that benzos can be extremely helpful and I would never tell anyone not to take them but the withdrawal symptoms were out of this world  
You are such a sweet person  my god   I don't have any friends  I don't really fit in  The only people who get my personality are the ones who've known me for years  Everyone else just thinks that I'm awkward and different 
Very true  one must keep throwing themselves out there in social situations  it could very well take awhile to meet someone worthwhile  you are in college though so you are in the perfect time to make friends  
And i think that when more Tv and cinema roles like this come then more and more people will learn about OCD patients 
Knitting  There's a bit of a learning curve to get started  but once you do  it's nice and mindless and keeps you busy 
Thanks a bunch  I've been realizing more and more that it's generally either school related or family  I just feel as if I needed to find some way to cope with it  Thank you for your response 
I listen to comedy stations on pandora or spotify  listen to books on audible  I read on kindle  I play crosswords  puzzles anything that forces me to think and concentrate on something other than my anxious thoughts  I take walks with my husband or my dogs   go to the drive in theater  or spend time with a close friend   That really puts me at ease  I can't sit still too long before I start getting anxious again  
I talk with them  but the dietician told me about it first  He said to me he made the diet like that because ssri's can cause memory loss 
Brain fog  racing thoughts  exhaustion  restlessness  inability tonenjoy pretty much anything so it's vry hard to get a handle on it
There will always be times in your life when you will be alone and this is found was when things used to pile on top of me fast and everything went down hill  I eventually just tried to be happy being alone or to keep myself entertained  It didn't work all the time but it definitely helped take the edge off it a bit  People can help you to not feel alone but I've also been stood in a room full of family and friends and felt more alone then ever   Try to focus more on what you can do to pass time when you feel alone and maybe in taking up new hobbies you will find like minded people to share your alone time with 
I have nothing to talk about with them  I just dont share the same interests as other people 
As others wrote  keep a good written log of what happened so far   If he tries again to contact you  let him know clearly that you want no further contact and any contact will be reported to the police   Hopefully  that will be enough to stop him  especially since he hasn't approached you in the past year   If he does try again  then do go to the police with your log and all the saved texts you have to file a restraining order   That should put a stop to it 
By caring about others  Call your mom ask her how she's doing  Or text a friend asking them about their    whatever they care about  Make connections  That's how you stop feeling alone  
Found this there now  Kinda hits home  Thanks for sharing 
I was just telling my husband how I dislike the gloomy rainy weather we're having in California lately  Unfortunately that's how it is most of December January  Not only that but less daylight  I work 8 5pm so when I get off  it's dark  and it feels like I have no time to do anything  I've been sick too  so it's not like I can be outside in the cold right now  I love being outdoors too  so it drives me nuts being indoors all the time  I feel your pain  
Well done on expressing that  I can understand how hard that must have been for you      "Sensitive is how I was made " Personally I can relate to this  There were times when all a teacher had to do was give me an angry look and i would be close to tears haha  I have OCD myself and can relate to checking myself in the mirror  i  Its good to know you are doing better  As for the whole telling friends thing  I was and stil am afraid of telling friends about my OCD  I told some friends I only knew after a few months and wasnt sure if i had made a mistake or not haha  Al in all  thanks for the post    
Why not see about volunteering some time to talking with elderly people or at a homeless shelter or anything like that  It will be a great distraction for you and on some of the peoples cases you meet you could mean a hell of a lot to them  That should help to shift the "worthless" feeling 
I've noticed that prion diseases like CJD and fatal familial sporadic insomnia get a lot of attention from people with health anxiety  probably because of how nasty they are  It's funny  though  since all prion diseases are exceedingly rare    The way I think of it is  MILLIONS of pounds of steak and beef are consumed every year  and an almost imperceptibly small percentage of that results in CJD  and even then  typically in unusual  isolated cases  If there's any disease you should feel safe about not getting  it's CJD any other prion disease 
Hey OP  You can PM me  I've dealt with this for almost 8 years
These are all great suggestions   I would add to check out  r traumatoolbox   It's for exactly this question   For people to share and trade ideas of what's worked for them to decrease anxiety and reduce depression around their trauma   All my best 
Unfortunately i'm stuck in the same limbo you are  Everyone around me seems to want me to "figure out what to do with my life" but I doubt they would accept my answer of nothing  Idk about you but I just can't seem to find interest in many things  I'm not good with advice but I suppose I could recommend you to see a course counselor to maybe figure out your interests first  
Have to reclaim your power again  If you felt very serious about that girl it's possible to be pretty deeply wrecked by the betrayal of cheating and the end of a relationship  You didn't mention how long the relationship lasted  unless I missed it   but regardless after a year and a half it's time to be moving on  I understand that can be hard when you got a job in a location that reminds you of her  but you can do it   If anything your story should prove to you that you turned your life around once and you can do it again  You accomplished things that you previously believed were impossible  just like you seem to be believing now that it's impossible to ever reclaim what you once had    One situation with a disloyal girl through you way off track  Learn whatever lesson you can from it and move on  You don't have to be guarded and cynical  it actually requires more strength to let your heart remain open and still welcome people into your life  but now you know that to some extent you always have to remain on solid ground in the relationship with yourself and who you are  because people will come and people will go  So many people let a satisfying relationship become their entire identity  and you'll never totally protect yourself from being hurt if and when it does come to an end  but you wanna be able to see the bright side of life and get moving again faster than 18 months    I know what I'm writing doesn't exactly equate to practical A  B  C advice about what you need to do  It's a personal thing that you'll have to decide for yourself  Start hitting the gym again  put up a dating profile and meet some new people so you can stop ruminating on the past  whatever it might be  
It's rather mean to tell someone to be thankful for pain     Everyone has hard things to deal with   Just because their difficulties are something you like the look of doesn't mean the grass is greener     Empty and pain are two different problems   Don't act like he should be thankful  If we went down that road  we'd all need to be thankful we aren't child slaves and raped and beaten everyday   
i feel similar
It might be obvious but you might be forced to take psychiatry medications if you weren't aware 
wrong dr  get out of there 
Healthcare system is a fucking joke 
I guess it gives me some hope  seeing how things could get better from a bad situation like that  I just hope that I can regain my confidence at some point  I used to be so fucking confident  I could do anything I wanted if i put my mind to it  and now I'm unsure of literally everything  I even ask to go to the bathroom at work  and I'm an adult  And a lot of that confidence I got because of the way she made me feel when we were together  I know it's over and it'll be over forever  I just hope I find someone who can make me FEEL like she did    I'm sorry to hear about your boyfriend reacting to that situation in such a way  I'm glad you guys got through it  and I hope things go smoothly from now on  It sounds like you both know each other well enough to make it work if the effort is put in    Also  i struggle with drug abuse which makes my situation incredibly worse  I'm a daily opiate user  Nothing heavy  just a plant called kratom which is legal where I live  But it's still abuse because I rely on it to get me through the day  I also take pills if the day gets really bad  And That's another thing too  when I was with her   she helped me get off this stuff  Every step of the way she was there until I was clean  And when we split  I started using again  I subconsciously did it as a "fuck you" which was a bad decision  but here I am  
i don't think that's an antipsychotic
Alcohol is actually an anxiety trigger  in the way that it dehydrates you  When you lack water  your body stresses a lot more  Drink water every day  I have cut out alcohol  sugary drinks  caffeine for the most part and have been consuming a lot more water  It's not a cure  but it does make you feel better  
I am with you  I suffer from emetophobia  Fear of vomiting  and HA  Winter is the worst for me  I live in Eastern Finland  it's cold and it's dark  My anxiety is always worst at winter  currently panicing about vomiting because I have IBS and been on a flare up for a week  c This is going to be a long night  D
Thanks  likewise 
I agree partly with mama megs  I was abused by an older man as a teenager and I felt extremely ashamed that I would be turned on by men with similar traits  I don't know if I can separate my turn ons from my sexual trauma yet  I still get triggered by men who look like my abuser  I don't want people judging me because of it  I think for me  ill be embracing it than rejecting it  Or try  Theres this technique called mindfulness that essentially encourages accepting all of yourself  including the parts that are hidden away  Its kinda brought some peace but I routinely forget to practice it 
You don't have to do anything meaningful with your life   Your purpose might not have anything to do with a career  or modern societal expectations  your purpose may just be to exist     What i'm failing to say is  do what you have to do  to support doing what you love  A career can just be a means of money   Not everyone has something they've wanted to be since they were 6      I'm becoming a nurse because I can make 30  an hour and only work 3 days a week   That leaves me with 4 days to write books  which is the thing i'm passionate about   
thanks for replying  should have been more clear  i'm not necessarily hung up on the girl  i'm hung up on the move  I made a horrible decision that I have to live through every day just by being here

Thank you  
Thank you  I will look for more options tomorrow 
abilify is an antipsychotic
I wouldn't worry about the paying part you'll probably both pay for your tickets individually  As far as dinner goes as a guy I was always told that he is supposed to and I would do so  if it bothers you then don't let him pay for all of it he'll appreciate it I'm sure but won't mind paying  All that aside don't let obsessing about it ruin the fun and good luck 
Sorry you're hurting  I too was one of those unlucky people who didn't feel drawn to a career or certain direction in life  I chose the one that seemed the most reasonable to me  automotive  and worked in that for a few years before deciding I hated it  Now I'm still lost and closer to 30    If you haven't even started college yet you still have time  People change majors all the time  Sadly there's no magic answer  You'll have to do self analysis and try to figure out what you could do that would satisfy you  fulfill some need in the world  help other people  make you the type of money you want to earn    whatever context you need to use to try to come up with something  
I know when I took anti psychotics I definitely had memory loss and basically I was a zombie  Actually zoloft and Prozac made me feel that way too  Now I take only effexor and I feel like myself and I don't have any noticeable memory problems  Medication works differently for everyone and I can only speak from my experience  Maybe you could try some different meds

You seem to be much more energetic currently  Are you still feeling the effects of the stimulants 
when I was in elementary school I was afraid of being run over  or the world ending  and me dying  Nowadays when I walk across the street I silently pray that I get hit  that way it wouldn't be my fault 
You should look at it in a way that makes you proud of the fact you have higher standards then most and aren't going jumping into bed with anyone just because it's been while  
thank you for your response  does help a little bit  what do you mean by isolated cases 
I can't encourage anorexia  I know what it's like to have difficulty eating  though  Plan high calorie meals like protein bars or shakes  Make sure you have at least 3 a day  
But they help me     I used to know everything about my hobbies    Now I can't even remember the scorers of the football games that I have watched 2 months ago

"Everyone goes through depression at some point "  False   Some people have depression and some people have feelings of sadness that go away   Catch 22 because weed is the only thing that makes me feel normal and the majority of my true friends and my family don't support it   Plus it doesn't fix everything I still am depressed just depressed and high     I feel hopeless  like nothing will ever fix it   
Because your job is distracting your brain  I'm exactly the same  Face deep in legal essays for uni for three days and nothing  Finally lay down with an movie and my heart starts palpitating  It's just anxieties nice way of giving us a wave with a wicked grin while saying 'still heeeeeere   didn't think you could get rid of me that easily did you '
Sadly it's one big chain reaction  People hurt others because of the ways they've been hurt before  You can only try to break the chain by not being the next link  Try not to let the way people treat you change the way you treat others  Try to not take it personally but understanding everyone is just broken and lonely and struggling and don't take the behavior of others as an assessment of your own value  If some totally random person walked up to you on the street and attacked you  I hope you'd be more likely to assume it was some crazy person out of their mind rather than "my god  what did I do to provoke that "  You have to try to look at other situations like that to  Someone being rude to you or disappointing you in some way doesn't necessarily mean you did anything  It's healthy and mature to try to ask yourself if you did anything to cause it  but you don't want to cross that line so far that you seek ways to blame yourself when you didn't cause it  
What happened exactly 
Try several offices  Try to also get in with a therapist  Start with your GP for meds  They can at least get you started on an antidepressant before you see the psychiatrist  It takes a long time for them to work anyways  so it would be a good starting point  
Okay  Why do you think that they don't believe you 
The issue for me is shakes do nothing  Maybe they give me nutrition  bu the pain stays  and that's what Im trying to get rid of  I'm not anorexic as I'm not doing it to lose or even maintain my weight  I just wanna do it so I can manage on small amounts of food
It's tough man  When you come out ahead  you feel like you can conquer anything  But most days  I feel like I'm stuck in a rut and it sucks  I see everyone else enjoying life but I'm just over here trying not to lose my mind    I dream for that one day  
  stop worrying  Heh    I feel actual physical pain in my stomach  throat and  sometimes  chest  and to top it all off  I may get dizzy  I'm not worried about anything    I'm in fucking PAIN  I wish this disease didn't make me carry so much weight  Hiding this shit from the public is agonizing  Sometimes I wish I could break my leg so then people would actually cut me some slack 
He would only tell me to "fuck off"  
Makes sense     cold and dark contributes to depression  so it would make sense that it can also do that to anxiety  
Hi pinkerton8   There must be some of this going around   I just responded to a question a lot like this the other day   I couldn't find my answer to that one  but if you're reading through other people's posts  you might see it   One of the things trauma does  especially based on the kind of trauma it is  is mess with our ability to judge situations and respond emotionally to them   Many people feel numb and dissociated  others "overreact" to everything around them   Working through what happened to you and being able to express your feelings around that  will help you to re establish balance in responding to other things in your life    It's not unusual to go from "I don't feel anything " to "I'm feeling EVERYthing and can't stop "  Oftentimes our inability to feel is actually repressed fear of ALL of those overwhelming feelings underneath coming out     Experiencing feelings during non personal events  like movies  books  other peoples experiences not close to you  lets you know that your "feeling meter" is intact   It just isn't ready to work on  your  stuff right now   Journaling about when you  do  feel  whether to a movie or seeing a bird in your yard or anything else  can help you start down that path   You can begin to  bring that into therapy and talk about the situations where you do have feelings   That will probably help find a lot of clues to helping you to feel in the more personal areas   So  for now  just notice where and when you do have any kind of feeling  sad  mad  glad  etc   and jot down the situation   Eventually you'll see a pattern that might help your therapist to bring you out more   All my best 
I cancelled my NYE trip to Iceland due to not yet recovering from anxiety  
Or better yet  cut an artery and wait to see how many people roll their eyes and say 'stop bleeding  it's not helping you' 
Thank you 
She wished me a Merry Christmas through text on Christmas  And a happy new year today  Do I ignore it  Do I tell her to go screw around with her new boy toy  Do I tell her how she hurt me  
Ok  Sometimes you have to accept the side effects  If they are helping you and you can live with losing a few memories than keep on keeping on 
Thank you  That makes sense  I'm a little sensitive so I guess I take things to heart more too  I try to live by the sayings treat people how you wish to be treated and if you don't have something nice to say don't say anything at all  
You're a hero  You helped someone despite feeling super anxious  I'm proud of you  You should be proud too  Hugs and thank you for doing this  
I've always been confident in my personality  and understand myself very well   It's the overwhelming negative thoughts that keep me anxious and depressed  I absolutely love using the concept you used that "it's just a thought in their head"   it's true  but i can't shake the feelings when i start thinking that way  Been struggling with anxiety depression since I was young  always trying to better my mental health though  it has been quite the fucking struggle  I've always worried about the way I look  and as I'm getting older  early 30s  I feel even uglier  so my confidence is shot  then I worry more about others not talking to me because of it   but again what does it really matter    sigh    Yes it's great that you go to uni without makeup  Nothing to get all done up for  makeup is overrated  natural is nice  Keep up the positivity and kindness    thank you  
No problem  You mentioned you don't have much of a support system   if you want to message me anytime  please do  I know I'm just an anonymous Internet person but I myself have received fantastic support from fellow sufferers all over the world     
That's quite helpful thanks 
It's take a lot of maturity to still be nice and kind to others who are nasty  I'm still learning but coming quite good at it now and it makes you feel good knowing that you don't have to be lowered to there ways because I have learnt you can't win with truly mean people they enjoy it  
Excellent advice and what I would suggest as well     I can never emphasize enough to clients the power of having a support network of people who believe you and will be there for you as you talk about and work out what happened and what you want to do with that information 
I laugh at dark depression or mental illness jokes particularly when they come from someone who also struggles with it  Maybe it's a coping mechanism  maybe it's just a way of hiding how real it is 
I lost my dog recently and it hurts so bad but I do the exact same thing  It confuses my family 
I had a FB profile before with all my acquaintances and friends from elementary school and high school and etc  I gradually stopped posting anything and was less and less tagged in pictures or posts over the years  When I got to college  I just didn't get the point of it and I would just waste my time looking at a feed of people I didn't like or know and every birthday I would get self conscious that I got less messages than the previous year  So at my last semester I deleted my FB  I was out of FB and most social media for a solid 4 months  Then I started university and work and somehow I felt a necessity to connect to the people I actually cared about so I made a new one  Got about 60 friends  all of which I know and talked to  I still don't post anything  I merely only have it for Messenger  But tell you what  I don't care  Scrolling a feed thay doesn't have random people's status and likes all over and just generally seeing stuff I'm interested in has made my FB experience much better  So my advice  Do some cleaning  Remove people  just stick to a small number of people you like  It won't matter if you don't post  none of it will matter actually 
Yes  pretty normal  Most people don't exist at one emotional level constantly  Many of us go through periods of feeling better and hopeful and then coming back to the depression   Don't think that your mom showing concern means you need to cover this all up and pretend it's not happening  She'd probably feel better knowing the truth about how you feel and being able to help you  The fact that she right away asked if you needed to talk to somebody shows that she was willing to help  and you instead took that as a sign that you should lie and deny it  Nobody can start forcing pills down your throat or making you do anything you don't want to  all you have to do to start out is talk to somebody  If you want to make your mom feel better  you can still be honest about how you're feeling but just reassure her that it isn't that she did anything wrong and you aren't about to go jump off a building or anything  you just feel down sometimes  
Anything that results in some sort of pain and is intended  not an accident  is self harm  so yes  that's self harm 
So sorry this happened to you   Two options   1  Text this predator back 1x to never contact you again if you haven't already  Be firm and direct  Only one sentence needed  You owe him nothing  No need for any explanation or excuse  He will respond with hostility so make sure you block him  Screenshot texts for evidence just in case they are ever needed    2  Don't text him back anything at all and just block him  The best thing to do with stalkers is to never respond   If you see him at the store again pretend he doesn't exist  Flat out ignore him if he says hello  This guy is a not interested in friendship  He is a predator and took advantage of you after you confided in him 
thank you   
My driving test was driving around a mall parking lot and just parking normally at the end  But others who went to a different place had to parallel park and crap  Some places are harder than others  If anyone asks just tell them you couldn't take it because  insert excuse here   Lots of people fail their driving test  And if you really can't drive practice some more you'll get it next time  
Pretty much exactly what you did here  I would recommend trying to sit down and write out some of what you are feeling  because in the moment in person to person conversation it can be a bit tricky to remember everything you'd like to say  Prepare a description of what's been going on while you are in the comfort of your own home so you can just bring it with you and hand it to them  Their first question is going to be what brings you here and what are you hoping to get out of it  so you might as well have your answer ready    In terms of your concern that you'll just have medication thrown at you  it's possible  Especially if it's a psychiatrist and not just a therapist  The one time I saw a doctor of the type who can write a prescription  they barely listened to me and I walked out with a script for medication a few minutes later  Therapists are different  they are there to engage in talk therapy and behavioral counseling  All you can do is attend the appointment and see what type of person this doctor ends up being  If it's clear that they're just a pill pusher  you'll have to probably look elsewhere if you'd rather do talk therapy  
That's what I felt at my friends new years party  Just alone  Most of my friends are in relationships and I just feel like nobody cares about me  Like something is wrong with me that I can't seem to get a serious girlfriend  Like I'm unlovable or something
Thank you  That is very kind  Sometimes strangers understand better than anyone in real life  honestly this community is so supportive and understanding it's a great resource  Thanks again 
I'd suggest a crisis hotline    in most countries  they're free 
I wish there would be someone who legitimately cared and took time to listen to me  Like  i have "friends" but none of them really care  All of them have their own group and i'm always left out  I feel so drained  but i've done absolutely nothing in the past week besides work  Just living is exhausting enough for me
Thank you  
I am completely right there with you
I actually like to walk around while I am reflecting and thinking about problems since it just feels natural for me  I haven't actually tried to walk around before playing games though  I might try that later

Oh hey dude  me too   I'm glad you're in dbt though  I wish I could do it 
Turned 21 two months ago  never been kissed  never been in a relationship and etc  When I was in hs I actually made a plan of losing my virginity by 20 lol but you know what  Didn't happen and I'm ok with it  it will happen when it's my time  I generally don't care because I'm trying to be a better person  a better artist  a better me and to actually have self esteem cause I don't want a boyfriend if I'm just gonna be self conscious and a downer all the time  That being said I do feel awkward when I'm with friends and they're all in relationships or have experience and they're talking about it and I can't really say anything  Worst is when they want to include me and ask me why I'm waiting or they give me tips and such  That can get bothersome  But everyone has their pace  I know people who are 25  and virgins  There's no race  there's no prize so  just focus on you and eventually it will hit you  You're not patethic   
Yeah  without real enforced consequences it can be hard to change  I too am someone who didn't benefit from parents who knew when to be strict  They helped me in all the wrong ways and refused to help in the ways I really needed    The irony though is that you seem to have the insight about why that alternative style of treatment would be better for you  and you seem keenly aware that you'll never get it from your parents  so you might some day have to just play pretend and decide to parent yourself  Even in his meek empty threat there is some truth to it  there will be consequences for your inaction some day  even if it's not until they are dead and gone and can no longer help take care of you  I know trying to imagine your own consequences isn't the same as actually having someone to play that role in your life  But so many of us will never have the parents that we wish we had  You'll either have to push yourself with your understanding that some discipline would be better for you  or whatever comes of your life you can fall back on blaming that your parents didn't use the right style of parenting  but at the end of the day it'll be your life in the future and nobody will excuse you for the failings of your parents    I'm sure it's hard to be a parent and to know when to implement tough love  You talk about wanting to mature but then even within this very argument it's a shuffling of blame onto how other people failed  You could get in the fast lane to maturing by accepting you're gonna have to enforce these rules on yourself and make the changes that you'd like to see    But yes  it is disabling to have parents who didn't know when to be firm  
Thanks a ton for this reply  There seems to be some white particles on it  but if anything harmless like dust is on it  I'll probably convince myself it's mold  
I wouldn't have any real idea what that would be like  title response   After getting to know me  people usually like me   But it's the fact that they don't bother to get far enough to "get to know me" before they're just gone   Can't very well go around tooting my own horn or you get accused of white knighting so       Damned if you do  damned if you don't 
Be honest with your doctor even though I know it's scary to say some of these things out loud  Describe exactly what you said above  describe the physical effects you may be feeling  They may get you a referral and they may write you a prescription  There are a lot of different treatment paths and the one you take is ultimately your choice  I went for help finally at the beginning of October  I've been back every 4 weeks since to follow up with my treatment plan  Don't be discouraged if the first thing you try doesn't work the way you want it to  If you are prescribed something  you will likely be started on the smallest possible dosage and the work from there  If you are referred to someone for therapy there may be a bit of a wait  You may be prescribed some immediately helpful but short term drug like lorazapam or other fast acting drug to get you through the immediate time until you find a more permanent solution that works for you  If you feel you aren't being heard or understood  reiterate to them whatever you need  I don't know you but I'm proud of you for going to get help for this  It's hard  it's scary  Depression has the awful ability of making you feel like you don't deserve the help  You do  You deserve to feel like your best possible self  Good luck  
I can relate  I have wondered the same thing  if there is something about me that is imperceptible to me but pushes other people away  Every friend I've ever had has bailed on me  and I struggle to ever make new ones  And I think compared to the average person I'm pretty insightful and do some pretty hefty self analysis  so if there was something obvious that I was doing wrong I think I would get it    Sorry you are hurting  I think real true friends are the rarest resource in the world these days  now that people are more interested in checking social media every 15 seconds and only investing time and energy into things that will immediately gratify them  There's an abundance of choice in everything these days  a million distractions available at your fingertips at any given moment  and people just don't care to take the time to get to know somebody  
well  it was ridiculous he screamed at me

chin up  if you are judgemental of yourself  try to stop it  in my case  it was hard making new friends because i felt the harsh judgements i was giving myself  would be the same in another persons view of me  learn to accept yourself  and others will follow  i know you're in a dark place  it gets dark as fuck  please do yourself a favor and go to a yoga class  preferably not a fitness focused one  but one more leaning towards the mental aspect of things  I promise you you will meet people who are comfortable with accepting themselves  their lives  and therefore other people  learn from them simply by being there  I wish you the best of luck and feel free to message me at any time  Who doesnt need more friends   one love man  
I actually going to the movies solo is better  but that also depends on the film  I would have never gone and watch Magic Mike without my girlfriends but otherwise I'm often alone at the movies  That being said I can't do restaurants alone yet  Well fast food yes but going to a restaurant at a table alone  Can't do it  It's silly but I always feel stupid and patethic  I actually never sat a coffee place alone either  Sigh  
Any update on how your doing   I my self suffer from childhood trauma   The way my childhood has now affected me  is in my attachment style  sounds a lot like you have the same one as I do  avoidant dismissive attachment  i e  Shuts down  self sabotages  As well as a host of other issues like boundaries issues    communication problems     It's easier said then done  As I have the same problem and am still trying to figure out how to not do this myself  but one way not to sabotage yourself relationship is to communicate to your partner how you're feeling  and let him know your feeling feeling  Feeling secure in the relationship will help you not be active in sabotaging it    Hope this helps  and good luck   Another great tool is therapy   
One of the best ways I've found to help with perfectionism is to switch where you focus  Focus on   progress not perfection      I know that you know that being perfect is an unachievable goal  Even things that seem perfect on the surface  such as a perfect teacup  or a perfect performance   really aren't so perfect if you start to examine them harder    A much more reasonable  and achievable   goal is  progress   Becoming a bit better every day    Another tip is to   shift your focus to your breathing    I think this subreddit already has some tools based around mindfulness meditation  Mindfulness is a game changer because it gets your brain in the habit of being in the present moment  instead of worrying about the future    It's not full proof  nothing is   but it really does help

 I can tell you that Xanax is a controlled substance and highly addictive  That being said  xanax is the least concerning of scripts I've seen  I would say something to your pharmacist  OR call your doctor and inform them if the pharmacist is making criticizing or inappropriate remarks  It just takes one phone call from a doctor explaining the legitimacy of scripts to shut it down  It sucks that you have to  but the amount of people abusing all of the legitimate medications that we actually need  is overwhelming 
I agree  please don't  Although things are hard  you are loved 
That's what it's all about   not feeling alone  It's so crazy how depression and anxiety can make one feel so isolated and alone even though millions of us suffer from it

I had something similar  although not as extreme  when I was younger  At around 19 years old or so I realized me and everyone I knew was going to die some day  The realization of that was crushing    I had been getting into samurai philosophy  and so I stole a technique from the samurai who were known to be pretty fearless when it came to death  I practiced a death meditation    The basics of it is you imagine yourself dying in a variety of different ways  Being crushed to death  shot  sliced  swept away in a tornado  etc      This  admittedly  was very uncomfortable for a long time  But after a few months I conquered my fear of death   Part of that process was also figuring out what I thought happened when you die and being comfortable with that fact    I actually recorded an entire podcast about my experience using this meditation  I know we aren't suppose to link stuff  but maybe you will find it to be useful  http   www brilliantside com conquer fear and anxiety using this samurai technique bsp 014 
I hope it works  They put me on 300 mg of wulbutrin and it didn't work out well  Not every pill works  I was awake for pretty much 4 days before I told my doc and switched to remron  At first I was alwlays drowsy but at least I can sleep  
Time  and effort   Been there OP and evemsa is super right  Just have to do it sometimes and stop thinking    Also  in talking to people about my experiences I've found that even those without SA experience this  it's just less persistent  paralyzing for them  takes more to cause     You're not alone in the least and it can get better  All the best to you 
Depression is never 'okay'  its a mental illness and should be treated as such  The time to see a therapist is when you start to feel depressed for more than 2 weeks 
Sorry to drag you into the ditch with me haha  But yeah the symptoms are pretty generic and probably applicable to a ton of perfectly fine people  
Nice to find someone experiencing the same situation  sometimes it feels like I'm the only one

There's no reason to feel ashamed of having bipolar  it's a illness and not your fault  Although feeling ashamed of the things you do because of bipolar is another beast     There is stigma and discrimination against people with bipolar disorder though  I'm not ashamed of my bipolar disorder persay  but I keep it secret except from those I trust because people can be really bad    Maybe you should talk with your dad and ask how he deals with it 
I've managed to get a 3 92 this semester all the while being depressed  panicking  going through a break up from a long term relationship and constantly thinking I was losing my mind  Don't ask me how I did it because I honestly don't know  Last semester felt like a haze  I barely applied myself and didn't learn the way I wanted to  I just memorized for the sake of doing well on assignments exams  You have 2 days left  If you can live through depression  you'll find a way to power through these next couple of days  My final exams were about two weeks ago and Let me tell you  it was not easy studying for Thermodynamics   Stat  Mech  I realized what was at stake and fought off any distraction and tendency to self loathe and give in to that familiar feeling of being numb that depression manifests itself as  Study the material as if it was a cure to your depression  Don't worry about anything else for now  I'm rooting for you buddy  Easier said than done but boy was I relieved after giving it my all despite my afflictions 
I've stopped trying to get better  I'm in maintenance mode  So basically just trying not to do suicide ideation too much    coping with the cycles  bipolar  which pretty much just consists of keeping my emotions as muted as possible so I don't hurt others or make any stupid decisions       It's less stressful this way   I'm comfortable knowing that I'm no longer setting myself up for disappointment  about 15 years of seeking treatment only to feel worse about myself each time  but I do realize that it's pretty fucked up that my baseline standards are "don't kill yourself" and "try not to ruin your life even more " 
Well done on making the decision to take an antidepressant      
How long were you in therapy and how many different therapist did you try  Just curious 
What people do you have supporting you 
If you were a server then why is it your fault that the steak ran late  Also  you say that you told the customer that the dessert was fresh out of the oven but they touched it anyway  and to me that sounds like the customers fault  I honestly think that your manager was harsh for firing you for those incidents  I'm sorry this happened  You are not worthless or stupid or anything  I have a hard time with memory especially when I'm stressed too but it doesn't have anything to do with our intelligence  
I'm in a similar situation  Everyone seems to click with others easily  but I never can make friends that stick no matter how hard I try  I've given up now because trying seems pointless  "The deep void" is very fitting  If you need someone to talk to or message on here  I'll always answer  Having someone who gets it would be nice 
You finally meet someone you really hit it off with and every day you look forward to sharing a new experience together  Then one day things slow down  The person is suddenly busier than normal  stops initiating communication  and all you're left with is a vast hole once occupied by hope and love  You feel intense loneliness which is only amplified by the happiness of those around you  You feel like that was your only chance at connecting with someone so deeply  and that if this didn't work out  there's no way you'll get so lucky again  I know exactly how it feels because I've gone through the exact same thing  More than once  And you probably will to   The disappointment and pain never gets better the second time around  It's crushing to feel so strongly toward someone and not have it reciprocated  in addition to losing them  it's also a hit to your confidence  But there is so much more out there than that one person  Hit the gym  keep up those grades  find a new hairstyle  join a club  take a trip outside the country  You will be surprised how much will change and how much  you  will change in the next few years  You will remember this as simply a blip in the past  Just keep at it   we're rooting for you 
Insight means a lot  thanks
You have a position of advantage in that you have the unique accolade of being there from the beginning  The management know you and the work you've put in over the years  And it seems you may have some friends in high places due to this  ones you may have forgotten about    Provided you haven't warped this account too much due to anger  I'm sorry to be blunt but I'm reasonably suspicious of some of the highly opinionated language you've used  you could raise the case you've mentioned here with them and  report your boss   I know that sounds a scary prospect but you seem to be putting a solid case together  You might want to line yourself up as a possible replacement discreetly also  I know it is more responsibility but really you could stump up where no one else will and do the job properly    If your current situation is a source of stress towards you the most constructive approach is to try and fix it rather than live with it gnawing away at you or running from it  This especially since you have a battle with depression on your hands  Sometimes you actively have to fight to push through life's challenges without being swept away

Depression can effect your memory so can SSRI  I took one for 13 years and I suffer from memory loss  My hippocampus is a bit messed up after I went to the neurologist for a scan  
I don't think there's any amount of acceptable clinical depression  He should've been seeing someone for several years if he has felt like this    Medication and therapy compliment each other  Medication makes it easier to get out of bed but doesn't help to express yourself    Encourage him to seek further help  Plant the seed  
To me it sounds clear that he should be seeing at the very least  seeing a therapist  In fact I'm surprised that he hasn't been if he's had a diagnosis for that long   Not sure if you've tried convincing him and failed or if you're too worried to bring it up at all  If you don't think you can bring it up without being too pushy  then we can try to give advice based on that  I don't think being angry or demanding that he seek therapy is going to be very helpful to him  but it may be that he just hasn't noticed how much he's been affected  I'd try to understand his experience of being unemployed  asking him questions and making it clear how you're willing to help   As always  make sure you're honest with yourself about what you can tolerate in the relationship

Nicely done   I think that small victories are actually a HUGE part of recovery because I think  more often than not  we take little steps towards wellness rather than huge strides  Those little steps stack up over time until one day you realize how much better you've gotten from a year or two ago    For instance  it was my first day of grad school today  something I was already feeling a bit anxious about  and I found out yesterday that I was exposed to norovirus on New Year's Day  A few years ago this would have sent me into a total anxiety spiral and I probably would have made myself feel sick from anxiety  but I actually managed REALLY well  I was able to reassure myself that it wasn't likely a bad enough exposure to truly get sick  and even if I DID wind up getting sick  I recognized that I could survive it and power through  even if it was really unpleasant   I managed to enjoy my first day of school without worrying about it at all  and guess what  I'm out of the 48 hour window without any symptoms so I'm probably totally fine    This probably seems like a huge victory but to me it feels like a small one  because it was one of many little victories in a long journey of recovery  It was essentially the next logical step towards wellness    So yes  Celebrate the small victories  because they add up to MASSIVE victories in the long run  and always be forgiving of yourself when it comes to setbacks  because it's all part of the process too

I have the exact same issue  I try to challenge it as much as possible and make my life as "normal" and enjoyable as I can  but at the end of the day the same irrational fear and panic absolutely dominates my day to day life  the big victories do feel very empowering though  and I make it my goal to chase that feeling of being able to conquer anything as you say   I've managed to visually suppress it to the point that only family and close friends know or can tell I have it  but it doesn't change what is going on inside my head  It's not exactly easy but I can look completely relaxed while having a full blown panic attack  It's probably the most annoying part of all of this  because while I can apparently pull off leading a "normal" life and appearing that way  people don't get to understand how hard that is for me to do unless I tell them about it  and even then most people don't understand what it is  how it affects me or how to help  So it's best kept as a silent struggle to most

That's how I feel  If I lived even 50 years ago I'd be dead by now  100  200   I'd be in an institution  300 400 I might be burned alive for being a witch  Why am I alive now  The technology keeps us alive  but not really living  I think about that all the time   some of us are just not built for life on earth as it is now  Why does everyone insist we can get better  Maybe in the future  but the technology to actually help us get better these days is so iffy   Sorry that was just reiterating what you've said  but you're not alone in thinking that  I am trying to come to terms with the fact that I'll probably decide to and carry through with killing myself within a couple years  It's like I'm mourning the life I could have had  but in the end who fucking cares  let's just make it all go away   Again sorry I'm so depressing  Just nice to encounter someone who looks at things the same way

Thanks  I'm just scared about facing my tutor tomorrow and telling him I haven't done the assignments I guess   3 It did help though  
Same boat as you  Just told my first appointment would be around  200 even after insurance helps  Such bullshit

By the time senior year rolled around in highschool all my friends since middle school had pretty much abandonded me  i had zero people to hang with  my SA was so severe I avoided people at all costs   During lunchtime when everyone else was having lunch with their friends  including the friends i once had  i roamed the corridors with no one to talk to   I was so ashamed to be seen by anyone like this that i hid in the bathroom stalls until lunch was over   I didn't even want to be seen in the library   I felt alone  forgotten  desperate for any sort of interaction  yet too petrified to even reach out just to say hi to anyone out of fear of rejection and reliving the ridicule i faced in the past   This happened for pretty much my entire senior year  alone in that stall   I couldve left at any time but the mind has a way of creating it's own prison out of past traumas we don't understand   I mean i still dont have friends but christ if i wasn't so afraid i mightve found a club to do some kind of activity with that year  How does this relate to what you went through   Don't know  maybe i'm still not over it and i hope it gives you some perspective 
Definitely  We are creatures of habit and that goes for everything we do  Even having negative thoughts and shutting yourself away can become an addictive habit once you get stuck in that rut  Understand that it's not you as a person that is being like that  it's the routine you're stuck in of being cynical and automatically thinking negatively about things    I've been in the same situation for 10 years and am only just realising that and getting help to get out of it  You can do it 
Good luck  friend
Yep I totally get that  I feel like I'm getting progressively less well and it feels like I'm just getting sick  plus all the horrible cognitive stuff  It can even be hard to tell the difference sometimes   I didn't know I was depressed back when I was like 17  I went to the doctor with all my physical symptoms   GI problems  sleep problems  fatigue  difficulty concentrating  low motivation  etc   and she told me I was stressed and needed to meditate and reduce my schedule  oh and take an iron supplement  Wish it'd been identified then  would've prevented a fucking lot 
It's ok  I have some really good friends   but I feel really bad bothering them with stuff  My family tries to be supportive  but in their minds I'm "cured" because I have the drugs and the counselling  They don't really get that it's an ongoing thing
Thanks for that  it's given me a couple of different approaches to think about       
Catholic Charities has psychiatric appointments on a sliding scale of payment  The highest is like  60 I paid like  15  And no it was no pressure or religious in any way  They were just there to help
I can agree with this 100   feel free to pm if need be   
Jesus christ I can stop these damn tears  that last part really hit home  Thanks for the boost of confidence Internet stranger  12 more hours to go until help with 25 years of mental illness under my belt  I can handle these last few hours 
I'm really glad that you're able to confide here and that you can also tell your friends  Can you tell any professionals about it  Even anonymously  like on a hotline   Do you have depression that prevents you from living your life to the fullest  I tried that  a "I'm going to live it up this weekend and then kill myself" sort of thing  but turns out I couldn't live it up when I felt that bad  Or are you suicidal even though you feel otherwise okay 
Sounds amazing  
You're right   I can never shut this brain off  it ALWAYS finds something to worry about and be anxious about   Ugh     Thanks for the link  I'm always looking for something to assist in relaxation  
Yeah  but I had some more today   Not quite as cheery as before  but I'm also missing some sleep today   Haven't taken anything prescription in over a year  though   I did want to convey that I was in a better mood   but I'm not sure that I meant to use quite so many exclamation marks   lol 
You're welcome  Reflecting back  I've done plenty of less than healthy escapism and avoidance  But some of the best restarts I've done was thanks to staying with friends or family for a bit  I'm grateful that they gave me that opportunity   Good luck  I'd welcome short PMs on your status if you find that helpful 
Hi  Yes  this is a common symptom of anxiety  sometimes called 'air hunger'  I get it at seemingly random times  and it's horrible  I suspect it has to do with long term breathing habits  For example  being anxious and stressed might cause you to breathe shallowly for long periods of time  without realising it  and then you have an episode of air hunger  Could also be to do with posture  or muscles  or stress hormones    Or all of those  Take your pick  
Just have fun and kick ass  Try not to take things too seriously 
from the bottom of my heart  i feel for you  i really do  stay strong OP  seek therapy during this time  at least you know that you're not the only one feeling this way  your family will all be there for each other during this time  
Okay  How do you feel about explaining to your family how you're currently feeling 
Thank you for your reply   I have experienced it a few years ago when I was going through a really stressful time and felt very anxious  and it just started to resolve by itself when I felt more happier   Just now  I'm in a situation that is really stressing me out and keeping me anxious  I try going out for a walk  but feel quite weak and light headed   Just feel absolutely wretched right now     What is a gravel 
Yeah hit me up  freeDorm exactly like that
Congrats   I hope that it works for you and you have mild no side effects   It took me a couple tries to find one that worked for me  but the meds I'm on now  Effexor  work great and I'm doing much better   It's a night and day difference 
Step one  Don't ever think you are bad at anything  Instead  Think of yourself as trying to get better  No one sits down at a piano for the first time and plays Beethoven  Conversation is no different  No one is bad  they are just inexperienced  You have to practice  then it will come naturally 
Okay  Are you still feeling suicidal 
I definitely know what you mean when you say its like having two voices in your head  I'm very grateful to still have my rational side intact otherwise im sure I would slip into full on insanity  I'm glad to hear you got the help you need  If you don't mind me asking what medications are you on if any 
You just put yourself out there on the internet  Join a club  or organization 
I'd like to avoid that  my mother will just worry  and I think Dad would just get pissed off  I don't see them as my main support system anymore  and I'll be moving back to school in a few days  so I don't feel I have much of a connection here anymore 
 and im not aware that it's outdated  then you gotta read more     And I'm also aware that humans can never attain the ultimate truth give that we are so limited with our ability to observe   This is very true and you are close  you just got to keep going  You got seriously a lot to learn  there is so many topics  beyond astronomy  that are hugely importnat to the universe  the more you read and educate the more you realize the system behind it all  all the magik that exists in this universe  all of things happening right in front of you that you cannot see  Perception is just as it is  nothing is real    We all learn one day 
I agree  I do have a good support system but it helps more than anything to talk to people going through what I'm going through  Helps me to realize that I'm not completely alone with my symptoms
This  Awareness of a potential problem can make it worse  I always find my pulse increases a bit when I start monitoring it 
Thank you for answering  I guess the stigma and discrimination has a lot to do with it  
Of course it's normal to feel anxious about certain things  like an important event such as an exam or a job interview  The problem   an anxiety disorder   starts when someone begins to feel anxious abnormally or irrationally   I would argue about the curable uncurable aspect of these disorders  I was diagnosed with severe generalised anxiety disorder and depression years ago  I've used several medications which didn't help at all  and then I went through cognitive behavioural therapy which did indeed help  but it's still pretty bad and definitely still severely affects my quality of life   Most people who are prescribed the medication react positively  and on top of this CBT can help a lot in terms of coping mechanisms and staying out of the trap that anxiety disorders leave in your brain  So anxiety disorders are definitely very treatable  but I wouldn't say they are curable  If someone has an anxiety disorder  it will take either prescribed medication or a cognitive effort to continually suppress it throughout their life 
I have this problem too
Same boat mate  Following for answers 
Okay  Have you ever talked to adults at your school about how you're feeling 
You probably don't have rabies  but since you DID get bit  it might be worth going to see a doctor  That being said   u lostinedental is right  Rabies is typically very rare 
He has seen a therapist off and on  just when the depression gets really bad  He just doesn't see therapy as a regular need  But it could be just a lack of funds growing up   He's somewhat open to the idea  and I definitely want to go to therapy with him  I think he might be concerned with the money  and finding a therapist that's a good fit 
Try different therapists until you find one that "fits"  You're not going to mesh with just anyone so take your time and find one that you do   I hope this helps some   if you need to talk  feel free to message  
Kinda both  I'm essentially always suicidal but some days I can't get out of bed and other days I'm fine
No problem  Hope it helps  there are tons of great tips on there  
disagree with the other posters  i tried the medication route  with 2 different medications  and the side effects were scary  it was genuinely a better option to just deal with my normal depression   i have a friend who is a biomedical engineering PHD student at Cornell  and he told me to avoid these medications as it's not fully understood just how they affect the brain  i ignored him  but i realized later that he has a great point   I know i'll get a lot of flack for my viewpoint here  but please understand that i'm speaking from personal experience as well as educated consultations   if this is your first time seeking therapy  sounds like it is based on your post   and you like her  then give her a chance before you start down the road of the for profit pharmaceutical industry  i'd say give it a few months and see if you notice any improvements  if you really are still struggling then  then medication may be worth the try 
Go back and get some counselling dude  maybe see someone different  At the end of the day  they're not there to give a fck about you  and they're not pretending to either  Their job is to analyse your issues from the outside and advise you how to fix them  because your head is not clear enough to do it yourself   Speak to some friends as well and just be completely honest with them  Trust me  I've been hiding my feelings for the last 10 years and putting on this mask of the funny nice guy  I'm only just starting to talk to friends about it now and I'm so surprised with how understanding they are being  You'll be surprised too  Speaking to people is a massive help  And if you go to a doctor they may prescribe you something to help you temporarily lift yourself up  and once you've done that it will be easier to fix your problems   Godspeed
I've been to the counselling services at school and was basically told to fuck off after a few sessions  
I know I definitely want to see a therapist  I feel like talking about some things might help tremendously  I like the idea of writing everything down  I am about to start my list  Thank you so much 
Check my post I'm making a depression support group for my girlfriend so anyone who wants other support from people over the world that could become friends let me know   
I know any amount of depression isn't ok  but when someone has depression for this long and after many changes of medication  it's hard to assume that it will ever be gone 
I haven't vomited in years but when I feel sick  I tend to obsess over it too  My way to fix it is to confront it  Say stuff to myself like "Yeah  that was really gross and felt really bad  but it's okay "   Thinking about it is probably making it worse for you  Is there something else you can distract yourself with    BTW  as someone who still tends to avoid vomiting  and is terrified of vomiting in public   holy shit  go you  You are a bad ass 
Ah  that must be tough  I have bipolar so I get that off and on thing even if the pattern is a bit different  Seriously  sometimes all that helps is medications  which sucks  And sometimes those don't help  Therapy can make you feel like you're not alone though  even if it can't convince you you don't want to die  Just in my experience 
I'm in about the same boat  It's hard man  It's fucking hard  I had to bug the receptionist of this therapist whose willing to work pricing and make it affordable 3 times before she finally decided ok she can "squeeze me in " like it's a dentist appointment  This is life or death for me  and working this hard to get the help to simply be content is treated as nothing  and why work so hard when the exit is right there    I'm sending my best  
How come 
If you're worried about schizophrenia  then you're probably not developing schizophrenia   Most people who develop psychotic disorders aren't aware that they are doing so   they lack "insight" into their own illness  The fact that you're worried in the first place is a good indication that you're NOT developing a psychotic disorder like schizophrenia   The fear of schizophrenia  meanwhile  is a VERY common fear in people who struggle with anxiety  I myself dealt with it for a long time  and still occasionally do  It feeds directly into the fear of losing control that so many with anxiety issues have   Rest assured that you likely don't have schizophrenia  and even if you did  you probably wouldn't even be the first to notice 
Isnt there an OCD foundation website   On there I believe you can find doctors 
I share the exact same fear  It's really  really debilitating  I love and depend on my family so much and my friends are everything to me  I can't stand the thought of losing them yet it's all I can think about for the past couple of weeks  Trust me you are NOT alone  there are many other people feeling like this  It's made me appreciate everyone so much more but it also scares the shit out of me  I'm going to a drop in therapy session tomorrow because it's out of control right now 
At the time I was going with help for my panic attacks  and they said that I was fine and there was nothing more they could do for me  They did this right before exams started  so I'm a little apprehensive about going back
I unsubscribed for a while  b c I was one searching for reassurance and I wanted to wean myself off the drug so to speak  but I come back tonight to find that people are still looking for tons of reassurance  still censoring words  etc   Bummer  
Exactly this  except recently it's actually been helping more  with my anxiety at an all time high  I've been vomiting a lot this past month due to it  it's helped with the nausea a LOT as well as my state of mind  being mostly alone people I know  if I'm going out just a hit or two will mellow me out  more then that and BRING ON THE SOCIAL ANXIETY AND OVER ANALYZING 
Me too 
Try another therapist  I know it sounds dismissive but I tried 8 before I found the right one 
I wish more people knew how accessible and cheap used instruments can be  They  rightly  think 'oh god  I can't afford an instrument' because they think you have to buy one new or something  If they're not afraid of a few scratches or dents  and you're not looking for a professional level instrument that would be at home on stage with the Vienna Philharmonic  they could find a very affordable used instrument online or in thrift stores and get started learning 
Take the leap  Get some more help  You need serious help  NOW  If this is affecting your physical health  you need help  now   Your nausea is probably almost entirely anxiety  
EAT  It's sometimes the last thing you want to do on this kind of medication but oh my god is it worse if you don't  Stick to the BRAT diet if you have to  bland foods  but eat 
Hey mate  I hear you  I did seven days a week  eight to twelve hours on weekdays and six on weekend for three years  It really fucked me up in more ways than one    Here's the thing  We live in a time where a steady job is a luxury  That  however  does not mean that you have to abuse yourself to do it  Trust me  no stakeholder benefits from a workaholic    My advice to you is to set limits  Work diligently for six hours every day  Set daily tasks that you need to accomplish  Screw around the rest of the time if you feel like it  but just clock in the six hours  Daily    The thing is that humans are only productive in six hour increments  That is why slave labor ranging back to Ancient Egypt relied on the number of bodies to do the job rather than on the skill of individual workers    And lastly  for the love of god  get a a hobby that you enjoy and devote time to it  I made a huge mistake when I gradually quit everything I  used to  enjoy for the sake of "recovering" from the day's labor    Good luck   Edit  Also  I would like to point out that you admit that you're not doing work tasks  but rather screwing around on the Internet  Don't worry  I've done that too  but realize this  If you start doing your  job  for six hours every day  it will make your life much  much more enjoyable  You will  I assure you on this  feel better about yourself and the job at the end of the day if you do the six hours in  
Okay  Do you have any type of mental health diagnosis 
You can make it  I know you can  It's hard to see it  but you can  Just avoid what's bothering you  If your brain is bothering you  avoid it  If other people  or the Internet  or whatever else might be affecting you  avoid it  I know you can get to that appointment 
Hey bud  thanks for opening up and sharing  It was very brave of you  I know how depression can make you feel like wanting to kill yourself every moment  I know life is miserable and fucked up and you feel like no one cares  It's okay to feel this way  But the world would be a much more sadder place without you  Think of your mentally ill mother and your baby sister  How would they feel if you killed yourself  Heck  I am a random stranger on the internet and I would feel fucking devastated if you killed yourself  The world is a wonderful place  Believe me  Most of the time it feels like shit but there are corners of the globe you havent seen yet and its gorgeous  There could be a chance you might travel some day and get to see the rest of the world dont die before then  There is a chance you will fall in love and get married and have kids  There is a chance you will meet your soulmate one day  There is a chance life will get bettter  Dont die before then  As long as you are alive you have chances  As long as you are alive you have options and you have the possibility of change  You have the chance to change your life around and make yourself happy  As soon as you die all of that is gone  Death is lonelier than life  You will rot in your grave with worms eating you  While you are still alive there is still time to reach out and communicate with others who feel the same way you do  Look at this sub  You are not alone  You know the main benefit of staying alive  You can stay and help other people who suffer the same way you did and help them save themselves    You are indeed severely depressed from the sounds of it  There is treatment there is therapy you are not gonna feel this way forever  This too shall pass my friend  Everything passes  The main mistake that we make is thinking our sadness will last forever  But it doesn't  The sun still rises every day  So will your sadness pass away and a new day shall begin  Hold tight friend you can do it  Please try to see a doctor and get help for your depression if you can  
I liked the post about identifying what threatens you in social situations and tackling them 
Hey  you and I are basically on the same boat  There's this girl i met on the internet different countries  and we have known each other for one year already  Recently  i've been initiating conversations more often and tonight i sent her a good night text and she replied "Thank  you    Good  night"  Those three dots really bothered me  Just two months ago she'd say "Good night sweetheart  sleep well and have wonderful dreams"  Am i upset  Of course i am  But i can't expect her to love me  I have to deal with that  And i always hope for the best  I hope that sharing my story helps you in some way  All the best to you   
I've gone through it every day for the past month and the celebrity deaths everywhere made it worse  No one who I've had a close connection with has died  my parents are relatively young  early 50s  and my sibilngs are 30 and 10  I'm 20 and everyone  except me  is perfectly healthy  I don't have any reason to worry right now but the thought of it happening one day brings me to my knees  I just can not bare it 
I found sipping on ginger ale  I prefer the Canada Dry brand   having ac on  and not taking too hot of a shower in the morning all help a little bit   I also have anxiety and my most common symptom is nausea     I also like this website I think the second technique is really helpful    http   www anxieties com 57 panic step4 
I literally just made my first post in this subreddit about my first appointment with a doctor to hopefully help me tomorrow  My turning point has been the last 2 days  it's been a really  really dark time  However  I saw a post on this sub today about someone who took their first anti depressant today with a string of comments on it  One of the commenters said that they had been on their meds for a few weeks before waking up and feeling alive  feeling like the person they were 2 years ago  I completely lost it  I do not feel alive  I barely feel like I am existing  The person I am now is a total stranger  a scary stranger  I can't live like this anymore  Half the world is on anti depressants it seems  so what's another person if it means I get to feel ANYTHING besides sadness and darkness  I hope you find the help you deserve  we all deserve a chance to live  
Thank you so much for your replies   It's quite scary  I hope we both get better  x

Yup  have plenty of vivid dreams  It's a thing with depressed people where they only go into REM stage  That's the stage where 'normal' people go into a couple times a night  other than the whole night  I had a dream last night where I was laughing with my old friends and was having a blast  The other dream I had was someone strangling me  My dreams also have all the cuts on my arms and legs from self harm  It's oddly vivid 
It's been a month already    It's probably to late for me already   Edit  exactly 20 days from today since I was bit   
Thank you so much for your reply  I'm seriously thinking about it  I hope you figure everything out x
Thank you so much for your reply  I'm seriously thinking about it  I hope you figure everything out x
Anxiety disorder is my primary issue  But I have struggled with depression in the past  
I got out of the car even though I knew people would see me
Thank you so much  That's a much better perspective  
I am very interested in hearing about anyone's non pill methods for disorder control  I am currently experimenting with diet with varying degrees of success  Part of the issue is I'm veg  so cutting out meat in addition is really tough  I do agree that cutting or quitting gluten seems to help with clarity and overall well being  Thank you for posting  please share what you are comfortable sharing 
Anxious feelings and an anxiety disorder are two completely separate things  Everybody will feel anxious at some point in their life  not everybody will have an anxiety disorder  That said  this is a support sub so if you don't believe that anxiety disorders exist  this is not the place to discuss it  I encourage you to open your mind and speak to sufferers of anxiety disorders to educate yourself before making harmful blanket statements that serve no purpose other than to stigmatize mental illness  
Okay  Does the school know what you're struggling with 
Thank you for that  Yeah something ginger could help with nausea   is that brand a spicy ginger  I would prefer something mild  Sorry you get it too  it's a horrible symptom  
Count me in  I'd be willing to participate in a Google Hangout type conversation to push the comfort zone further as well 
Good for you  I still can't get help  not strong enough  Someday maybe I'll be like you  
Can we be friends  Seriously  I have the same exact feelings  PM me  
Thank you for sharing that viewpoint  I am open to the therapy process and gaining new skills there  but I didn't like how she shut down the possibility of meds after knowing me for less than an hour  I just want someone who willl support me in whatever treatments we both think are best and I was turned off my her refusal to really help with the process of getting a psychiatric evaluation  What were some of the side effects you experienced  
I'm literally shaking  my head hurts  my body is really cold  I'm crying  I'm going insane  I've literally lost all sanity  I want friends  I want new people in my life  However I'm so psychologically damaged from being lonely and being treated like fucking shit  I always wear a fake smile  underneath is sheer hatred towards people of my own age  I have been nothing but nice  nothing but supportive  and people have to stomp all over me  I don't want to live  I don't want to live when I've lost all my sanity  I don't want to live where no matter how much effort I put in  I'm always thrown aside  It must be the fact I hate partying  drugs  and smoking  Can't think if any other reason  I can't fucking take it anymore  I'm tired of having episodes of hysterically crying every single night  My life has become too painful  I also got temporarily laid off from work because I've been working too much  Everything that could possibly go wrong is going wrong and I literally just want out 
Based on my experience as well as my studies in psychology I firmly believe that therapy is really the only thing that helps  The trick is finding the  right  therapist  because like there at unhelpful  bad match doctors there are also  unhelpful  bad therapists  Your husband really has to find one thats best for him  I suggest using psychology today's find a therapist option  You can read profiles to help find a good match  
I do this all the time  even though I don't like smiling  It doesn't make sense  Maybe it's some kind of inner coping mechanism I'm not aware of 
Best thing to do then is to just stop them before they brush it off  just drop the "i need help because i am depressed and contemplating suicide"  Don't give them an out   But how'd you go today anyway 
I started to post again on Reddit  I think this is my 3rd comment this year   
Yeah  sometimes  Because if i dont speak for a while  my voice gets really weird when i actually start to speak  So just saying hi or bye after like an hour of not talking freaks me out  But hang in there 
Was this your first therapy session or have you been speaking with this therapist for some time now  Either way  I think it's great that you're talking to someone  When I was first diagnosed with GAD my general practitioner was my sounding board and it made a world of a difference to vocalize my emotions to a third party without fear of judgment  and I've made huge strides since seeking that help  Keep it up    My anxiety manifests with very intense physical symptoms like the ones you've mentioned  so I totally know where you're coming from and they definitely don't go away after talking it out  at least for me   I would advise just taking some time to practice self care  avoid caffeine and other stimulants  get plenty of sleep and make sure you're eating well and staying hydrated  Exercise has been a big help in keeping my emotions in check  so if you're interested in giving that a try I highly recommend it   Bottom line  take it one day at a time and make sure your needs are being met  Best of luck 
Talk to your university therapist  there will have been many and I mean many people that have gone through this and sought help from the schools services 
I'm not a doctor  but from what I understand  the rabies virus can remain dormant for months  or even years  If you catch it before the major symptoms appear  I believe it's treatable  Since you're coherent and able to post online  I'll take that as a good sign   Although  it's probably because  as the user above said  you don't have rabies  Still  my first impulse would be to get checked out after getting bit by a strange dog  even just to check for something other than rabies  You're almost definitely fine  though 
Same thing happening to me right now  Not so long ago I had tons of friends I talked to everyday  Now I have like one friend i talk to maybe two times a month  But hang in there  the odds of you being lonely forever are probably pretty small  since internet is a thing  hang in there 
I have experience going cold turkey with paroxetine  which is another SSRI    I felt the same pulses in my head  I heard strange zapping sounds in my head and felt them too  'Zap    'Zip '  it was like hearing my neurons communicating with each other  really uncomfortable experience     The best thing you can do is to sleep it off  I slept maybe 15 hours a day for the first few days going cold turkey  Eating sweets and drinking a lot of water also helps    Most of the withdrawal symptoms went away within 1 week for me  but it took 1 month to get rid of the head pulses 
No problem  how are you going 
It's true that professional help is expensive  I wont argue with that  But things like stretching  hot showers  hot chocolate and other little things that might bring an ounce of joy are free   I dont know  I tried  Currently feeling very depressed and lonely myself so feel free to respond  Maybe we can keep each other company 
Well done   I'm on Prozac  Started the past summer  I hope it helps you with minimal side effects  
What is the max dosage 
same  i feel like i have periods when life is lit and then even longer periods when life is just full of depression and anxiety  you can always hmu if you need anyone to talk to 
Check my post I'm making a support chat for my girlfriend with depression  it's lots of girls with depression all supporting each other if you'd like to be a part of it   
Absolutely  Everything I drink is caffeine free and it makes a big difference 
I think you missed the part of my post where I said I have not been in a real relationship ever before in my life  which is because of social anxiety  But thanks for the reply anyways 
yeah  I think I get that zapping  too  I've definitely been having trouble sleeping  Mom gave my room to my cousin and his wife and kid  but then had trouble sleeping  still been have trouble since I've gotten back to my own place  thanks for the help 
same here  just started celexa like a week ago   dont even feel anything haha
It's obviously easier said than done   When you're really tired and drained  it's a challenge   But in my experience every little bit helps   Psychologically I'll feel better the rest of the day  and usually have more energy  easier time sleeping  etc   That said  I hike 1 2 hours a day because of my high energy dog   And when I'm drained  that can be an hour of slow moseying   I try to workout in the morning  but I sometimes manage a mere 5 minutes of exercise   Squats  weights  circuit stuff   Or maybe 10 minute of lazy yoga   It's always better than nothing   Are there any symptoms in particular you are wanting to address 
No problem  Glad to help   By isolated cases  I mean instances where multiple people get CJD from the same source   "outbreak" would probably have been a better term to use  Instances like that might make the actual rate of CJD seem greater than it really is  thus creating needless worry  if that makes any sense  
I'm really sorry to hear that you're in such a tough spot right now  I promise you can recover from this  Please try and get some food  even if just a tiny bit    you need a little time to rest and recover   If you need anybody to talk vent to  please don't hesitate to message me  I know how you feel and I wouldn't wish it on anyone 
I feel like I know what you're talking about  The utter hopelessness of  "well  this is me for the rest of my life"  can be soul crushing  even in the good times when you think  "ahh  I feel good today but tomorrow I will be back to my normal  sad  self"   The feeling that the good times are too fleeting and forever waiting for the inevitable downturn  Personally I feel that these thoughts will never ever truly go away  life is just too turbulent to be happy all of the time  In my experience the thought of "That's it I've won  no more depression for me" is a dangerous one as it only works to make the next downturn worse  Therefore it is important to learn as much as you can in the bad times   and   the good  making the conscious effort to gain new insights into yourself   to disgustingly over simplify  recognising what makes you sad  what makes you happy  what kind of thoughts start to enter your mind when you feel yourself on the precipice of no return  what changed in  your life  that brought you out of your episode this time  what changed in  yourself   what happened today that you feel good  how can that be repeated  The list goes on  In short  I don't believe that anyone 'just gets better'  their ability to deal with it does when they are open to adapting their way of thinking      When you say 'stuff' what do you mean  Psuedo normal 'life' stuff  paying bills finding a job building or maintaining relationships  or are their particular extenuating circumstances in your life that would be hard for anyone to deal with  In either case it is not a weakness to feel weak  True strength is found in ones ability to  endure   a trait that I personally hold in a higher regard than many others as it transcends the circumstances of the individual and provides a window into the integrity of their character   Now you talk of not being being able to cope on an evolutionary level  Where I understand your statement and have thought similar things myself  I would argue that the successful evolution is built on two defining traits    1  The ability to adapt   2  The ability to endure  The very fact that you undergo this battle every day  despite the fact  you do not always feel like you're winning shows that on an evolutionary level  you are doing exactly what you need to do    As a sidenote I would say that comparing yourself to others is inherently unhelpful  I e  " x  isn't bothered by  y   so why does  y  bother me so much  I must be a pussy"  and just leads down a road of self perpetuating internal resentment  We are all on this arduous march my friend and we all have our strengths  even if we ourselves cannot see them    I hope I've managed to address some of your issues  I've drawn quite a bit from personal experience and hope I haven't missed the point   All the best 
Thanks man  I've been getting some pretty bad panic attacks because of this whole thing  hopefully I can convince my parents to let me go to doctor  I just hope that dog wasn't rabid  The bite didn't break the skin as far as I can tell and I was wearing jeans    So hopefully that helps  Again  thanks for the advice man  I appreciate it 
 "so many people help each other stay afloat when we feel like we are drowning"  if we all hold onto each others limbs we can form a human raft and float to a nearby tropical island  
Thanks  I have brought it up before and thought maybe I shouldn't bring it up until I'm sort of asked about it  I just don't want to get too far into things and then she finds out and it weirds her out or something like that  Maybe wouldn't be too devastating for her but it might be for me if I'm really digging her   
im the same age and i have this problem too  so you are not alone  take some days to just relax and think about what you really want in life  maybe a new hobby will help you find out who you are  but dont stress it  most people dont know what they want in life when they are young 
I hear you  I suffered from emetophobia during my childhood and teenage years  If you haven't tried it  I found that seltzer water greatly helped that particular fear 
It can take a long time to find a drug  or more often a cocktail  that works for you   Talk to your doctor  express when you think a medication isn't working  be open to trying different things   Sorry  it's super fucking frustrating   Probably most of us have been there 
I have exactly the same problem as you  My body basically shuts down when I drink any more than just a little caffeine  I think it's mainly caused by a caffeine intolerance  for me   but because the symptoms are so similar to anxiety  it actually causes me to have panic attacks as well  I've been mostly caffeine free for years now  the most I can handle is the caffeine in a single can of Coke 
I feel ya there   100   
It's 2AM right now  I'm missing school tomorrow again  I'm only going back to it this thursday   I feel like if I say that to my parents they will just tell me the same thing over and over again 
Perfect  perfect comment 
Just get to Friday  Tell your therapist  I think moving could be really good for you  get you in a new place where you get freedom  your brain energy can be used for setting up your place  finding your tribes and not thinking about all the awful shit you've been through  
Do you have a therapist or anything   Have you ever tried writing all this stuff down 
You know those prank electric buzzers  That people could hide in their hands and then you get shocked and OUCH  And then next time you see them  they offer to shake your hand  but you're a little wary about it  It's kind of  sort of  a little bit like that    Except maybe you were shocked really badly  or maybe shocked a lot over a long period of time  and now sometimes you get angry about it or depressed about it because it really sucked and it feels unfair that it happened    Or sometimes you're out minding your own business  having a good day grocery shopping or whatever and then you see somebody's hand and suddenly your heart rate goes up and you flashback to being shocked and all you want to do is leave the store and hide hide hide hide until you feel safe  Or maybe kick them or scream  But mostly hide   Or you're sound asleep but wake up in a cold sweat with heart pounding for the third time that night and you desperately wish you could just fucking forget about it    Or you have to go to work and everybody thinks handshakes are no big deal  so you try to act like it is no big deal  and logically you even know it is no big deal  but your body keeps reacting with strong fear responses like it is a BIG SCARY DEAL  Tight chest  racing heart  goosebumps  feelings of dread  trembling  sometimes more or less symptoms that may or may not be visible   So you try various medications  therapies  coping strategies  etc to try to get back to "normal" so you don't have excess stress after  aka post  a trauma    from your post traumatic stress disorder   I can't speak for everybody but that metaphor is about the best I can come up with  Just replace electric buzzer with situation s  more physically and emotionally painful than anybody ever wants to experience 
Doctor Who fan with lady bits and an interest in women's health   Just about to get my RN and will go on from there  Works either way  
is prozac any good  im thinking about starting to take it 
No problem  Glad to help  The fact the bite didn't break the skin is very good  and even if it had  the numbers would still be in your favor  I'm very confident that you'll be ok  Good luck to you 
Escapism no doubt  but some times it makes me more anxious if i think about it   My anxiety focuses on schizophrenia psychosis and the likes  So because i'v read that STPD  Schizotypal personality disorder  tend to live in their own "fantasy" worlds  my anxiety skyrockets when i remember that   This is also why i tell people on  r Anxiety they should never google stuff to find out what they are feeling  because you can really fuck with yourself 
Barf 
Is it bad that I just did it and it felt nice 
Awesome  I'm a student physical therapist with an interest in pelvic floor therapy  
that's fair  but understand that maybe she isn't "restricting you in what you want" but rather  she's using her education   knowledge of her field in determining that medication isn't the best option   i took effexor  and then wellbutrin  effexor completely took away all feeling  and gave me erectile dysfunction  which was awful as I had a gf at the time  wellbutrin was much better  at least at first   but then after about 2 months i started getting even worse anxiety than before  got so bad i had to leave work early some days  and curl up in my bed  couldn't even leave to eat dinner  it also gave me really bad rage  as i threw my phone against the wall and shattered it after some friends made fun of me  was a huge overreaction  and this is what ultimately led me to realize that the medicine isn't for me  can't say that i'm doing great today  but i don't have the crippling anxiety since i stopped the medicine   also understand that  at least for wellbutrin   the generic version does nothing  i was told  through forums  and my psychiatrist  that the brand medicine was the way to go  which runs  1500 per bottle    luckily i had good insurance  but still cost  50 per bottle for me   anyway  keep an open mind and get the facts  don't discount your therapist  like i said  after a few months  if you think therapy alone isn't helping  then just get referred to a psychiatrist through your general physician and he'll help you 
I know what you mean by facing it on your own  but that isn't entirely correct  Others are there for you and so are doctors if it is that bad   I used to work at a servo  aussie slang for gas station service station   I was and still am and fighting depression and anxiety  The boss I worked for was pure poison   There was an aged care facility right next door and every morning Henry would come in to get a 500ml bottle of milk  some bread and a newspaper  He would always be there every morning at 7 30am   Seeing Henry was the highlight of my day  He was such a nice man and easy to talk to  I'd talk to him about his day  his plans for the rest of tbe day  anything  He'd ask how I was and sometimes drop a "pearl of wisdom" or just hear me out with a smile  They guy was well over 90   It took him about two minutes to walk from the back of the shop to the front  so I used to walk with him and carry his things for him   That's what I mean  you could be somebody's Henry  the person that they look forward to and you wouldn't know  At 8am if he hadn't been in I'd actually get a little upset and worried   But no  you aren't alone in this  You don't have to carry it yourself  i'm lucky enough to have found a woman who loves me  understands me and is there for me   Yeah it may feel like a joke and the joke is on you  but you do have someone  If need be  i'd be happy to be that someone  no judgment here   Are you seeing a psych at all  They may be able to help you lighten the load  I have to see mine at 3pm today AEST  It helps you should talk to one if you feel alone in this  I went to about 8 different psychs before I found one I liked  I see both a psychologist and psychiatrist seperately though  What works for me may not work for you   But if you are alone and down in the dumps why not give it a try  What have you got to lose   Edit  I'm going to add you to my friends list thing on reddit if that's cool  You can talk to me even if I am some random ocer the other side of the world  I don't know you or your problems  but i'm here if you want to talk to me about it  That's the thing mate  You aren't alone  i'm trying to get you to see that and I'm extending my hand to you  If you don't want to take the offer then that is completely up to you  But you aren't alone 
I guess this is a better way  opposed to cutting myself  Thank you 
Sounds like it  If my anxiety goes up I feel like I can't touch food  Haven't been able to eat more than one meal per day the past two months  Feels bad  
I'd say better to make an appointment and see a doctor sooner rather than later   You seem to be pretty self aware and get that something is off   A lot of your life can pass by while dealing with depression   When are you going back to school  
Thank you  I actually spoke to my mom today and she's willing to up hills with me and practice  I'm hoping I break out of this fear soon and fast 
I've been on antidepressants and the like for about four years now  I've gone through lots of medications but nothing seems to really help me personally  When starting something new there's usually a brief period of improvement but then I slip down into new lows  I've just been getting worse and worse  I want to try treatments like TMS and electro shock  and worst case a cingulotomy  but that's not really something I can bring up easily when I'm still fully dependent on a family  As things are right now I just have to keep hoping that the next medications do something for me 
Yeah  anything new to break that funk is worth trying 
Yeah you're defiantly right   I never thought of keeping a diary with me  I'll try it out sometime this week or the next  I appreciate your advice feeling a lot better with this 
This happens to me  My grandmas dementia was very bad and although my mum seems in perfect health I get terrified  I think that what you're saying about her being forgetful and misplacing things is very normal but your anxiety is making you hyper aware  And for some positive news  doctors are very close to finding medication that allows us to control things like dementia in the same way that we would diabetes  In the mean time encourage her to take up a healthy diet  regular exercise and some quality sleep 
I'm aware that it's possible and for many people it can definitely be treated to the point where it does not exist  And that could definitely be defined as being "cured"  I would love for that to be the case for all sufferers  but until it is I can't personally blanket these disorders as curable  I can't say it's curable while I've suffered from it for almost a decade   As for going through life  I feel like I live a very good life and my anxiety disorder is probably one of the only real problems I have  It is intertwined with absolutely everything I do and if I'm doing something new or even just slightly different  it's always very difficult  There are less than a handful of places I feel safe  secure or comfortable   I guess I'm just speaking from personal experience   this disorder has plagued me for a long time with absolutely no end in sight  I fight extremely hard just to have a semi normal existence and it's never ending and incredibly draining 
I wouldn't say it's spicy at all  I just feel all the other brands have a tin like taste  
   wonder if CBD oil has   the same   AchEI action   I don't think THC has AchEI activity  due to the surplus of data showing that it causes memory deficits through AchE or a process that is interrupted by AchEI   However  I  think  you're getting at the fact that CBD might be an AchEI  and that might be true  I really don't know   If so  it would be a neat interaction between THC and CBD  like a balancing act of sort 
I think it's possible that your therapist may have a more complex view on drugs than she stated in the first hour  so it may be worth revisiting the topic before jumping ship  Maybe even tell her that you like her but don't think you can stick with someone who doesn't support your decision to try medication    I really struggle to find a worthwhile therapist so I personally would hesitate to throw away that relationship without talking    Also  at least where I live  my general practitioner can recommend a psychiatrist  I wouldn't lie to her but you could work around her to assert how important this is  Or you know  find a new therapist  It's really up to your feelings on the matter 
Oh that's a good one  Good luck in your field   
Your not alone OP  I realized recently that most if all of my friends that I had back in high school doesn't even care about me  After high school is like I don't even exist to them anymore  Currently in college and haven't made much friends yet either  I figured that I might as well use this time that I have right now to improve myself  work out  study  find a new interest etc  I advise you should do the same too instead of being so bored

Just tell him that you feel very uncomfortable with him doing these things and please stop  If he does not  tell him you are going to report him to the child protective services 
It doesnt matter because the feeling Will always bè with me 
Loneliness is normal    Everyone gets lonely when they spend too much time with themselves  introverts do this a lot more often  I'm 24 and I've felt very lonely at 17  All I wanted was this girl that I was in love with but she didn't want to be with me    I started drinking a lot with my couple friends and going to parties just getting drunk off our asses and not caring about anything other than having fun  It helped with anxiety and it relieved some of my social awkwardness but it was a double edged sword like most things are  I've done things I'm not proud of while inebriated and it has shaped a skewed view of things in my head that I'm still trying to chisel out and remedy   Instead of drinking  taking drugs and just in general participating in risky behaviour I would advise you to start a hobby or begin learning an instrument or taking up a sport and being persistent in one or more of these endeavours  The benefits you get from meeting new people and engaging in new social circles are tremendously important in shaping you as an independent and stable human being  You also get a lot of satisfaction from the process of improving at what you're doing no matter how slow it  is   You WILL meet new and interesting people who WILL get you and WILL want to hang out with you by just going out and participating in things you truly like or are passionate about  Don't look for friends by how they look or if they're popular or whatever  go do something that interests you and talk with people who are interested in the same things as you  it's how you will find people that have similar thought processes and appeals as you do  Be brave  Take up a pottery class  Anything really

No problem  I love it  and I actually like hearing the little shaking bottle sound it makes to remind me   
I have this exact same problem and it's 1000x worse during the holidays with all the sales  so now i'm  3000 in debt all because all the spending was so fun and seemed like such a good deal at the time  
I was talking with my boyfriend and joked that I'll just be one of those failing youtubers type deal and he suggested to me maybe even try it just for a hobby while I sort more stuff out    I think I might start doing something like that  like streaming or youtube just to keep me busy  I prefer to be busy rather than twiddling my thumbs and over thinking  I do need more hobbies anyway
For sepation anxiety  looking at favorite photos of the person helps me   I feel anxious when I can't see the person  but looking at a picture of them gives me some comfort   Watching a video with them in it can also be helpful   Also  distraction helps  watching movies or doing things to keep your mind away from anxious thoughts 
The optometrist sounds like he has issues of his own  It's hard when people make assumptions about people  and feel the need to offer unsolicited advice  Honestly it's completely reasonable to express yourself by saying something like "oh thanks  but I know this already" or "yes  that's interesting  Mind if we get back to the eye appointment "   Maybe this isn't the best advice  but sometimes people don't understand their assumptions are wrong  and you have to show them that you're capable and intelligent and aware on your own    It's hard to do this at first  I know sometimes I sound passive aggressive if I haven't practiced assertiveness in a while  But practicing is the best place to start   Sorry you experienced that too  
It's a process  and we're here to help  I hope you keep getting better and learn those coping mechanisms  It really helps 
I'm just freaking out today over how time seems to move so quickly  Like there's not enough time in a day  When I get home from work  I'm just so drained  There's a lot of stuff I want to do  mostly art related   but what I really need to do is to just go off by myself sometime  it's the only way I can recharge  
Yes I didn't see that part but I wouldn't bring this up on your own  If the topic of previous relationships come up and she asks you the question then of course be honest  This is the reason why   If you tell her this upfront and she doesn't know you well she will automatically think that is a red flag and may cease contact    If she knows you better and then finds out then she will be more likely to give you a chance if she has already likes your personality  You can Aldo say that you've only had a few relationships in the past and no reason to go into detail if not needed    The reason I mentioned Craigslist is because from what I heard  more "experienced" people use that site for hook ups and relationships so they are likely looking for people that have experience as well  Does that make sense 
It wasn't my first therapy session  but the first time talking with my therapist via phone since nobody could take me to my therapy session today  
Yes  It became so problematic for me that I had to stop drinking caffeine for almost 2 years  I cut out coffee  sodas with caffeine  even chocolate  I'm just now able to slowly drink a bit of it again  I started by drinking decaf coffee  decaf coffee DOES still have caffeine  just very little  then half caf  now I can have a very small cup of regular coffee once in a while   So yes  it can cause anxiety  because it is a stimulant  If it becomes very bothersome  try cutting back on the amount  If that doesn't help  cut it out completely     
Oh no  I've gotten steadily better  I was a wreck  and I do mean  a wreck   my first few months  One you realize that they're thoughts and they don't define you  they're just part of you  like an arm or a finger   it becomes easier  I'm to the point now where when it does flare up  which isn't often   I can just let the thoughts go and move on with my day

Thank you  I said in another comment that my boyfriend has suggested that I maybe start youtube or streaming just as a way to busy myself so that I have a goal to work towards  I think that's a good idea as it will give me something to do while I work out what I really want to do
Lately I've been sleeping up to 20 hours a day  day after day  I haven't been able to go to school  shower  eat  or even get out of bed  It's a typical occurrence in depressives  and it's horrible to be in  One thing I'd suggest though is taking something to help you sleep around ten or eleven and getting a full night's rest  keeping to a proper sleep schedule can often make it easier to get up and out the door 
Antidepressants only have an effect on 30  of people who try them  If it's been three months  I suggest talking to your doctor about trying another medication  It can be daunting to think about having to taper off one medication and start another  not knowing how it will effect you  but it's worth it when you come across the perfect drug or combination  It took me around 6 years to find the perfect combination  with several suicide attempts and hospitalizations in between  Looking back  I'm thankful I stuck it out because the medications I'm on now are life changing  
my health anxiety definitely peaks around this time of year
Man   reading this was hard  I lost a lot of people throughout my battle with depression and each lost still feels like the first one  Even when i learned how to put people at a distance  close off myself  i still end up losing those dear to me  In fact  recently i lost a very special someone who i thought i could trust my life with    You can blame them for hurting leaving you  or you could blame yourself for getting too close  I've had depression for almost 4 years now  and i still both  Remember that pain is relative  if your problems aren't strong enough to kill you  they may be strong enough to kill someone else  some people just can't handle others' problems regardless on how much that person means to someone  especially if that person's problems is greater than their own 
That just makes my stomach drop for some reason 
Same  I can't even remember the last time I genuinely laughed    
Prozac is a pretty good first antidepressant  Like all antidepressants it will take a few weeks to kick in  but it has milder side effects than some others and if you need to get off it  you can taper it off pretty easily  Far less horror stories coming off it as you can cut down and be done with it

I failed twice   In MASS state troopers sit on the test with you  And my anxiety was spiked so high I could barely function   If only I had popped an atavan or Xanax beforehand   On the third try I got a nice old statee that was chill and nothing like the meanest man I had twice before  Finally passed 
I have one too it's great  Do it while listening to podcasts audiobooks  
I dont even know where to start with my therapist    She won't say a thing and I will lhave to talk and talk and talk  Its always me talking  I am just waiting for her to butt in and tell me something  I just blabber on about nothing and she ends our meeting at what i feel like is abrupt  
I'm in rural NE TN  3 months out for psych appt is standard  Only way to get quick help is via suicidal threat   Then the help you get is mass quantities of psych drugs that make you feel dead or no better  This is the first time a new pill hasn't fixed my depression  It really sucks  CBT every week not too helpful  The things that help the most are THC and activity  Crazy but the THC gives me the motivation to get out of bed and go on with life  I'm not a kid either  57yo F  So yes depression sucks and most people don't understand  I know I didn't  Until now  Sending happy vibes 
You know there are like    athletes who get depression right 
Oh that's great  I'm glad it worked out for you   
Hi guys  sorry it took so long to respond  It's been busy  Thank you to everyone who has commented here  I really mean that  I'll be responding to each comment individually  but I wanted to post an update here     Besides the texts on Sunday  he hasn't really tried talking to me since besides a few Snapchats being sent  I don't exactly mind  because space feels good  besides being like almost 1 000 miles away now as well  I'm now feeling like maybe some of this is my fault  or maybe he subconsciously resents me because I don't feel comfortable having sex or being nude  It's just a mess and I've been trying to stay busy with work to keep my mind off of it 
Have you told them where you are mentally  Where you   actually   are and where your mindset is  including the thoughts of a "permanent solution"    fyi it isn't a solution    The only thing I could really do is ask you to ask them again  but be 100  honest about it  Don't dance around your issues  As I said  don't give them an out  if it is easier for you to talk to one  then divide and conquer  so to speak   I'm sorry I can't get you the help you need but hey  i spend way too much time on reddit so you can talk to me at any time   I would also advise going for a walk in the sun  jog if you can  but physical activity will ease the load  You say you are overweight   kill two birds with one stone  Ease the depression while burning excess weight  You may find as one goes so does the other  Walk it off  metaphorically and physically   You're still in school  I hated it there and was in the same position you are now  I have been there and I know where you are coming from  You said it is 2am  that puts you around the great brittain area if I'm not mistaken   Are you able to book a psych yourself  Do they have a public health system where you are  If they do  ask them about it  You may be able to book yourself in   But try bringing it up with one parent on their own if they shoot you down when they are together   It is hard and it hurts but you won't get through this without some help   Only reason I did was because i was able to sneak in and buy alcohol without ID because i could grow a beard  I would not recommend this as I now have liver problems due to my drinking history  Just hang in there and hit me up for a chat when you're down in the dumps  k 
You cant help someone unless they want help     Its very unfortunate but it sounds like your dad doesnt necessarily want to change     have you talked to him    Like sit down and tell him what he does to you and your family   Hopefully he will understand he has a problem  because thats usually the hardest part     I hope it works out for you  and there are tons of rehab programs to help   Maybe getting him outside more would benefit him  I dont know the extent of his injuries   
good luck  you can always hmu if you need help or anything 
What's even scarier is that he has never shown a side like this before in these two years  He has always been cautious and mentioned that he hated trying to initiate sex with me in general because I have a habit of recoiling  even if I don't mean to  and he didn't want to "feel like he was raping me"    I worry that maybe this is subconscious hatred resentment of me and my issues  lack of self confidence love  etc  I'm using this next month and a half away from home to really evaluate this and have literal space  but whether my hunch is true or not  I may have to agree with you too   
oh okay  ill guess i will try it then  thanks 
I've been reading a book about anxiety  and in the book they say that anxiety disorder is not a mental illness   We have a fear that we will go crazy or lose it when we have a bad panic attack  but it is not actually going to happen   It's completely normal that you can't think rationally in a state of panic    The adrenaline spikes  and your body goes into fight or flight mode    We live in a fast paced stressful world  and more people than you know deal with some sort of anxiety disorder   People with anxiety disorders are normal  we just can't handle stress as well as others 
I was ten not nine oops it was just after my bday 
You could ask your psychologist about psychotherapy 
I had to fire that doctor because she shamed me badly when i was asking for help with the fatigue   I also had a pinched nerve that was causing a ton of pain and preventing me from working out  which on top of the fatigue was really making me unhappy with life   She mocked me  told me my only hope was a 900 calorie a day diet and or bariatric surgery  called me a liar  and wouldn't tell me what infection i had that she was prescribing antibiotics for   I just wanted help finding the energy to work out more  dude   
You are absolutely right  I wish I could just look past this  but a few days later  I am still feeling shocked and hurt  I don't know if this is related to flashbacks or not  but I am taking this a lot worse than I thought I would   I feel like if his apologies were more sincere feeling besides some awkward texting  like  calling me  for christ's sake   it would be worth  trying to get past the shock  But since all I get is a weak "I'm sorry  I feel like crap" message  I feel more inclined to just end it  I'm not sure he takes this seriously  maybe it's because he may resent me somehow  and I feel like that's all my fault 
Ok cool I will check it out  I've had ginger ale in the past that has burned a bit 
Thanks so much
Then I'd make it clear to him that you think it's worth the money  Especially to get through a period of unemployment or lower than normal social contact 
Its a long story but essentially we were running a special menu that night in addition to our regular menu  The special menu had to he fired separately but in conjuction with the normal menu  I had been quadruple sat  it was Christmas Eve and only one person at that table ordered the special menu  So I fired the next course and totally brain farted on the one order off the special menu  There was a lot going on 
I tried to think how to describe it  but I couldn't and it became uncomfortable   I imagine that's the way for many of us   So  please don't be offended if you don't see many responses   All I can say is  terrible things happened   Things you wouldn't wish on your worst enemy   Because of that  and because some of my trauma is new  I don't know the full scope of how it affects me yet   I know some of my triggers  but often find myself in circumstances and triggered and it was not expected   Those situations can throw me for a loop for days or even weeks   Often I will flash back to the moments of trauma  and I will do nearly  anything  to escape whatever whomever is the cause   These episodes  can manifest negatively such as me shouting at people   However  I cannot control it   I live my life in a near constant state of fear because of that   "Will I get kicked out of a place  or arrested today   Worse "  Another big issue is validation   Many of us struggle to validate our own trauma   This post is basically asking us to validate it to you  a stranger  just to satisfy your curiosity   I know you didn't mean anything by it  but it will definitely make some of us reluctant to respond   
This looks super confusing lol
As someone who has actually done this     DO NOT TELL YOUR FRIENDS   because 1  if they're truly good friends of yours  they'll do everything they can to stop you so if you're really serious about which i hope you're not  then that may interfere with your plans  and 2  you might end up losing them 
I'm sorry that happened to you  too  Thank you for your support     My boyfriend has had more than his fill a handful of times in our relationship so far  but has never been like this before  I fear it's resentment peeking through and that  yes  it would only get worse  I feel like this is my fault for not being normal and capable of just whipping my clothes off and having sex like a typical girl  but I can't really fix that  and I'd rather walk away than feel guilty for something I have a hard time changing 
It's hard to show people your other "you"  so it might be easy just reaching to a stranger and being yourself  I don't know
you still there mike 
I want to kill myself
I think it's cause there's no consequence  Nobody cares if a stranger judges them if it's someone they've never seen and never will see  But if your friends and family knew everything then they might judge you  and people can't deal with those they love rejecting them 
My first driving test I thought I had done great  I parked the car and the instructor asked me how I thought I did  I said "great"  He then frown and asked if I noticed that I had only  come to a complete stop  at 1 stop sign out of 10  I few weeks after I took it again and passed  A lot people fail it a few times before they pass  Don't let it get you down   
Not that great  You 
Idk if I'd say I got a 'bad' person  I'd say she was just really careful  She said I didn't necessarily do anything wrong  From what she said I'm surprised it was enough to fail
Are you angry 
So annoying when people ask stuff like that when they already know the answer  just seems like they want to make you look dumb
I've got that unmotivation  Actually  I'm avoiding my homework right now  and its only seven fucking sentences  O wel  You keep saying that she still likes you but at the same time your saying your not good enough  Considering the fact that staying away from her isn't doing any good  you should at least try to get something going again  
I've been on 18 different meds over the past 25 years  I currently have a psychiatrist who says oh well if you can't afford one of the new drugs      The only thing left to try is lithium and ECT  No  Not good options  Good luck  Just know everyone reacts differently to different meds  So keep trying  At least I got relief for years at a time on SSRIs but sertraline made me suicidal  
I felt the same   It was nerve wracking heading to basic  but its not terrible  There are some suck days  and some not so suck days   Youll always be hungry and tired   But it got my life on track  I hope it can help you in a similar way   Just enjoy it   Its the most fun thing you never want to do twice   
Thanks  Hope all goes according to plan this year
Yes  it sucks that you basically just have to try medications until you find one that fits   But  if you find a medication that works  you can feel and function so much better   If the side effects are bad enough that it's not worth the benefit  you can bring this up with your doctor and likely try another medication   Most all side effects are temporary   I'm a woman  so can't speak to ED  but I can understand why that's a horrifying prospect   Bring up your concerns with your doctor   Maybe you can start by trying medications with less severe side effects or low incidence of ED   
I sincerely hope things get better for you  Good luck 
I hate going to the library    I'll see if I can find them on YouTube though   I've been thinking of writing a story since I was 15  I'm 24 now  I was inspired by comics and games  both Japanese and Western 
Mind if I add you 
Do you have a therapist  Actual prescription drugs  
 I had my first panic  anxiety attack this morning  My chest was tight I couldn't breathe  I'm emotionally drained   It's horrible  I hope you find peace 
Does it matter 
Why  
Try to make conversation with someone   Give them a compliment or ask them a question   I feel less out of place if I'm talking with people   
Yeah  mood  emotions  can all really affect your appetite   Some days nothing tastes good  and I can be hungry  but have no desire to actually eat   As long as it's not happening all the time  it's probably okay   Sorry about the person passing 
If a therapist said that then they are a shit therapist to put it bluntly  I saw about 8 different psychs before finding one that I liked and felt comfortable being open with 
I agree with your idea of silence being beautiful  talking just to talk is annoying  And it's fine if you're not amazing at science or math  because people who are really good at those things are bad in other subjects  And there's a lot of people on this planet  so you're probably not the stupidest one    If you're always thinking of things you're not good at  you'll never achieve anything or improve in other things that you might excel in   
Congrats  That might sound minor to some but it's a huge deal to many others  you deserve to be proud of yourself  
I think it has some importance  yes  Also  who  you are angry with 
Oh yeah  all the time  When my heart starts racing really fast and I get short of breath  I also get nauseous 
I'm truly sorry for what has happened  i've lost people because of my depression as well and each lost still hurts like the first one    Maybe a distraction could do you wonders  it has helped me when times get really rough  something or anything really to get your mind off of the people you lost  Making new friends or meeting new people might ease your mind of things  not a permanent fix but at least you won't feel too lonely    Again really sorry for what happened  i know too well what happens when people can't handle your depression and i hope this comment helped 
Wish you best of luck
That's a tough spot  I'd say the drugs and alcohol definitely don't help  but idk if they directly make it worse  Brick walls are okay we all need to vent sometimes  I hope things get better for you   
Ok  thanks  Addressing your point of being honest with myself  I think that's part of why I'm reaching out to outside sources on this  I'm being patient and compassionate now but I fear that one day I'll snap and not be able to tolerate his current behavior anymore 
I probably shouldve mention i dont but probably need meds and no therapist 
It'll get better on the child  You're doing the right thing   I'm on the end part of my fight to get simple visitation with my child  It does take a long time  but it'll be worth it in the end  
Yes  I don't have severe anxiety  but too much caffeine brings out my anxiety  I try to drink a maximum of one cup of black coffee each morning or I just drink herbal tea instead 
Think about it this way  in the 60s  give or take  a woman was screaming for help from her attacker  everybody naturally thought somebody else would call  nobody called  She ended up dead because the attacker came back 
Good old me  Could you please answer my question now 
Relating so hard to this  Met someone online  ending up driving 5 5 hours to meet in real life  Wasn't really romantic at all irl  which was totally cool with me  I knew that was a possibility and was totally happy to just be good friends  But our conversations have changed and become less frequent and it made me realize how much I enjoyed his presence in my life  even though it was just a lot of texting  We still talk  but it's not the same  I miss the way it was before   
I believe I've experienced this  It just feels like I want to move  but I need to stay still more  like giving into a compulsion  Eventually I can move  but there's usually a prolonged period where my body won't catch up with my mind  which is usually racing  It's a weird feeling  like my body feels extra tense in a nervous tingling way    I always just said I felt frozen from anxiety and fear  I know I've read about people who literally freeze up during great stress  I didn't know there was a more scientific way to describe it  
You should totally try to get meds and a therapist  probably way better than drugs and just suffering like this  
Noo i'm not avoiding her we talk pretty regularly sorry that wasn't clear  I wish I could  get something going  but the problems that broke us up are still there  Thanks though man means a lot that you read it and took the time to respond   
I've started experiencing this  I have some extra money and all i want to do is buy clothing and random things for hobbies  I'm afraid of spending all my money  
YES  Its so bad for me  I cut coffee out  its not in your head  I miss it  but its worth it  
I think you could channel your anger into something beautiful like a drawing or a sculpture or you could write poetry  It's better than cutting yourself  
Caffeine is known to trigger anxiety  It's common enough that my psych warned me off it 
I get my information off YouTube  science updates and all that   Magik  There's a possibility but I find it hard to believe  And yes  reality is illusion 
Yeah I certainly go through 'phrases' of this  just crying and not even knowing why anymore  I think sometimes it's to just do with things that may still be on our mind  but we're not consciously aware of it  yet our bodies are trying to sort of help us through it  I don't know 
Okay  Same reason as before  And I'm okay  thank you 
Strangers on internet are people you don't see in person  U can't see or hear their reactions and u know they won't be able to confront you considering they're strangers 
I gave up trying to find psychiatric help  The wait time was two or three months  or they didn't accept my insurance  or they weren't taking new patients or  the best ones were "we don't treat patients who have taken benzos" or "you're not that bad  so we can't take you"  I'm  not  that depressed or anxious  Thanks  I didn't know that    I feel terrible to group everyone into one gray colored bucket  but you're just a paycheck to them  
You're    Confusing me with that cryptic quote 
 hugs u tightly 
Hey there  I really do understand your indecisiveness  try looking up aboulomania as a starting point  I think that will help you get a better understanding 
I don't like making posts  anywhere  often because I feel the need to reply to everyone who responds otherwise I'm just ignorant  I stress because I can't think of a good reply to every comment then I stress because I haven't replied and it goes on in a circle  
I'm sorry     virtual hug   I don't know how to make this feeling go away  but I experience the same thing  not about being stupid but I have an endless  running commentary of self criticism focused on being careless and making mistakes   in case it makes you feel any better knowing you aren't alone  
I've found coloring books super cheap on wish com  I can't seem to find these connect the dots though 
Interesting  I'm at the other end of the spectrum  I'm 57 depression all my life self medicated age 13 33  Prozac worked great for 10 years  Then got another 10 out of lexapro  Then 4 years from venlafaxine   Now big pharmaceutical is not working so I've gone back to THC  Not ideal but at least I'm getting out of bed  So I now feel like a kid again sneaking around "being bad"
But even when I'm not having a panic attack  there's the pressure  
Thanks for this insightful post  
I genuinely think people are fucking with me when they have any interest in me  Like it's some sick joke or a dare 
I know exactly that feeling  I know how it feels to lose that one girl and I know you're happy for her  but it's also important to be happy for YOU  I don't know how to do that  but I hope you figure it out man 
Some people find the strain of weight training or martial arts to be helpful   When I was younger  I know martial arts helped   Not even the physicality but the loss of self in pain    I guess   
Hey there  I wish I had some better advice for your  but I just want to let you know that you're definitely not alone  Every time I start seeing someone  I get so anxious and freaked out about every little thing that it makes me feel like I'm better off alone  The second I don't get a text back or I see an unanswered snapchat  I'm convinced they don't like me anymore  Then my self confidence plummets and I end up doing something that makes the situation worse  The best way I've found to get through these times is to keep myself distracted and busy with other things  especially things like exercise that remind me that I'm still a great person without needing validation from a relationship  But I definitely feel for you and hope you're able to find some coping mechanisms that work for you 
Thank you so much for responding   It really does help to know that I'm not the only one with this fear 
Listen  I failed my test five times  Got it on the sixth try  The whole experience was a pain in the ass because I got so anxious I couldn't handle it and I had to start logging my hours to show them I was practicing  but you know what  I got it  So it took me a while  big whoop  You'll get it too and it'll feel way better when ya do  I promise    U can do it   
Wellbutrin was really scary for me   I was suicidal and had horrible panic attacks  
Hi    just a response to let you know I read your post and am sorry for the way things are going for you right now   I can't relate to the specific anxieties you have  but I relate to the part where you say you have to hide it from others and can't share it  It's pretty isolating  IMO     Does your therapist know that you're popular in school so that you're basically hiding in plain sight when you're there  
Congratulations  I take Sertraline and it's been helpful for me  I had to increase from 50mg to 100mg but sometimes that happens  It also takes a while to "work"  so just be patient  
If you can't find the source try and clean where you first encountered it  If that doesn't work  clean yourself and put your brain to work as hard as you can to get your mind off of it  I play video games and watch documentaries to keep my brain busy  Keep going and don't dwell on it  
Thank you so much 
Agreed  It's very hard admitting that you need help 
Thanks for the support  I was able to make it in around 11 and I'm just thankful that I work for such a supportive employer  They offered to let me come in whenever I'm ready and work from home as necessary as long as my work gets done    I really appreciate the advice  It's true  As soon as I made it to work I was totally fine  
I don't think its unreasonable to be so concerned about a friend  but I'd also note  I've camped and backpacked many times in storm conditions    It seems worse than it is     Though  I'm sure the psychotic part won't help safety  it could be just as unsafe in town  no   I do hope your friend is ok and contacts you soon  that has to be really stressful 
No I said be thankful you can feel both good and bad emotions and feelings  once you lose these things then you are in a world of hurt  so yes be very thankful you still have that emotional capacity  I'd give anything to have that       
     all very good advice that I agree with  especially not doing her work anymore  
Rules  2  Do not post or respond with  Claims about the efficacy of any treatment or self help strategy including religion  3  Please don't diagnose others or advocate for or against specific treatments or self help strategies 
  I don't think I am that good of a person  I have a strange desire ti physically and or mentally hurt others  I try to put this at bay with things like video games and drawing  I draw alot of violence  but I still don't know why its there and it won't go away     I gett very lonely but never want to interact with others  I'm very asocial a bit more than just being introverted     I don't like telling people about my feelings because I don't like being vunlerable  I get anxiety at random times and sometimes fear for my life when I am alone for no reason     I don't feel happy nor sad but I don't know if I want to change this  I lack motivation even to do things I like I get frustrated and angry when I make mistakes and often give up easily    I'm messing up in school  I am too lazy to do things and my mom isn't very helpful about it   These points are literally me  I'm that lonely rude asshole from class who stays away from everybody to avoid a fuck up  the kid who does nothing because he is just not enough to make to the end   Oh well   does it matter anyway  Life just fucking sucks  Also congrats on sharing thoughts here on reddit  A small step i guess  but an important one 
Seroquel is the only thing that knocked me out so maybe ask your doctor about it    Some things that I do to help me fall asleep other than medication is  No caffeine past noon  Strict sleeping schedule and getting out of bed in the morning  Doing breathing exercises while trying to go to sleep 
What ended up happening  You doing okay 
Great post  Agree with everything in it    Often times  I hear read depressed people lamenting how they cannot "change"  like flipping a light switch from darkness to illumination  I avoid mentioning this in response as it is often taken as an insult  You don't change   You adapt    You hit the nail on the head right here  
The therapy session happened 
This happened when I heard my step dad and mom fighting  I tried to keep myself anonymous  but soon my step dad found out I called and was so  so angry with me  The officers and my mom assured me I did the right thing though  It's hard when you're not sure  but I think it's better to be safe  I've heard of people getting assaulted and no one helping because they didn't think there was anything wrong or they thought  someone  would call for help 
You're very welcome  If you ever find it flaring up feel free to PM me  I've made great friends through this sub 
You are a good person  and you understand what she is going through  But if she isn't giving you the opening  you can't force it  I guess just be there if she contacts you 
Try volunteering  You said that you thought about becoming a teacher  perhaps there are some after school programs that you could volunteer in to help kids with their homework  Keep yourself busy  like that you won't have the time to dwell about life    I'm in college  I didn't know what I wanted my major to be  I just knew that I wanted to work with children  I only knew that because I volunteered at an after school program and loved helping the kids with homework and just talking to them  I'm now working on my degree to be a social worker for at risk youth    Your path in life dose not find you  You need to go out and look for it 
Everyday 
Yeah I'm not usually doing good  Sine days are better than others but not many  And I'm not on meds so the good days are farther apart
Why post that though   Do you go up to children with broken arms and say "be glad you still have an arm" 
L theanine my friend
"death as a cure for life "  This is a beautiful statement  it encapsulates everything to me  
Thanks    This is a good  simple thing to keep in mind 
This looks interesting and like it might help me  I think I might try this  
High school can be a drag because most of the classes are required and you're set on some unilateral path  it feels forced  College is way different  Think about it as a way to find yourself and what you're interested in  It's the beginning of your adult journey really  You mentioned a bunch of subjects  Look forward to being able to take the most diverse classes you can find your first year   take psychology and computers  and anything  You'll find something that you lean towards and enjoy   As far as right now goes  volunteer somewhere or find a cooking class to try  Ask your high school teachers or guidance counselor where to look for those kinds of opportunities in your community  
From what you say  I don't think giving medication a shot would be a bad idea  I recently started taking medicine for anxiety  lexapro   the first day or two I felt hungover to be honest  but since then it has helped a lot  Hopefully you have a good doctor and they won't be just guessing your medication  My doctor asked me a lot of questions about my lifestyle  concerns  habits  all kinds of stuff to help get me on the right medicine  I'm sure as you let them know what you're worried about they can work with you    also  if it helps at all  they almost always start you on a very low dose  and then bump you up after a few weeks if all is going well  This hopefully would help you to notice any side effects before you are at a dosage where it might become a problem    I'll also say that I feel way more like myself than I have in a long time since I started medication  I don't feel numb or anything  my emotions are the same but I can handle them way better     Edit  I forgot to add that last bit  
Great  I saw your other post and then saw here that you were having a rough time today  so I'm happy for you that it ended up happening    
I've only tried lexapro in terms of legal drugs  though THC has always helped me  But recently stopped mainly from lack of funds  difficulty finding it  cause illegal  and pressure from docs and family  I just wish the worldwide legalization of thc would speed up  yeah I know it turns me into a zombie  but at least I'm enjoying myself and not getting image flashes of a noose around my neck  
I definitely can relate to my food intake effecting my mood and physical condition  I  try  to stick to unprocessed foods  more greens than meat  and as little bread as possible  But  as I said  I try  and I havent been sticking to any sort of diet lately    I have read about paleo and keto as interesting options for treating health issues  but I havent taken the time to plan a meal routine    This being said  I do love food  and I cant really think of any foods which I dont enjoy  but I would like to stay away from dairy  gluten  bread  and things like these  Other than that  I love most vegatables and most meats  and cheese  omg its hard to stay away from cheese   I sure would appreciate you taking the time to share some recipes with me  I would appreciate it very much    Again  thank you so much for the support and sharing this awesome info 
Ahh interesting   Thank you  D
YES  Decaf everything forever 
I feel you on those child hood reminicions and the days when you didn't have a care in the world 
Great job  OP  You could have saved someone's life  
  Freeways are tough because you are "trapped" between exits  That is what I'm struggling with  but I'm getting better  I've pushed on to a few more exits now  4 in a row is the most   I thought it would kind of 'level' out but the anxiety is still gradually increasing with each passing exit    I think once you know that you are ok to drive the car if the anxiety hits you feel more and more confident  I'm not sure I'll be doing interstate travel anytime soon  but its so very nice to at least be able to get onto the freeway  I was basically frozen at the entry before   Were I live has horrible traffic and the freeways are pretty well full 24 7  so I figure if I can make them here than I should be able to do it anywhere        The trick if anyone from the future is reading this  Do one exit and keep doing it  Do it 5 times in a row  have a break for an hour do it again 5 times in a row  Then keep doing it  Do it every single day  Even if you do one exit 50 times if you can make that one exit without the anxiety spiking than its much easier to carry on 
It was good for anxiety  it did cause some digestive issues but they weren't intolerable  but it made me manic when we pushed the dose too far  Shortly after using it I experienced psychotic symptoms for the first time  After that came the worst depression of my life   If we had stayed at 20 mg vs pushing to 30 and not have gotten rid of an adjunctive mood stabilizer I think it might have been OK and worth holding on to  YMMV 
Thank you  Feel free to message me anytime regarding this  it would be a huge help 
My insurance has hoops I need to jump through    First step is going to your primary  They won't prescribe you meds you need unless it's like ibuprofen on a flu med  Everything else needs a specialist    Then they tell you to call psychiatry to make the initial appointment with a  social worker   Those are easy enough  Except the person put words into my mouth and I had to correct them a million times  They need to write that you need meds and that you need therapy  Can't get just one at the same place  And this appointment was just medical history and such which could be looked up by a click of a button  Since my medical history is in their system   Then you go to make appointments  For meds they need to make a psychiatrist appointment  For therapy  a psychologist visit    Psychiatrist is only a month wait  At which rate I haven't had my meds since August  And everyone just keeps assuming I somehow have them still  But they only prescribe you things    Now you need a psychologist visit for therapy  Those are 2 months wait  And that's just whoever available first    So now the latest appointment they can make is during your work hours because  like them  you have an 8 4 30 job  I have to spend   each appointment while missing income  I can't take a lot of time off from work or I won't have a job therefore won't have insurance   But the social worker did give me a nice printout of suicide hotlines  in case I decide to do something crazy  because it's not like the psychiatry department can help me anytime soon  Oh  and I'll need to prove to the psychiatrist that I do  in fact  need the meds and would like them back  But wait  they don't prescribe one of my old meds by this provoder  Which means a new drug all together or none at all   So here's me with my psychiatrist appointment later this month and a therapist appointment next month  I wonder how much longer do I get to be miserable  Because no meds since August is rather bad  
how old are you  I feel you are hesitating because somewhere inside you  you know that there is a life of your choosing once you can live on your own
At least you got to pick your therapist  Mine just threw me to whoever is available in this giant place 
Hallo nochmal    Hello again    How are you today  Would you like to tell more about the SNAFU    Not feeling motivated is very common during depression  and understandable considering what you have been through  You may feel exhausted and hopeless  like nothing is worth doing  You may feel afraid to try anything in case it brings more pain  None of this is fun  but you're not alone  Try to remember that you are still loveable even if you achieve nothing  And maybe there is a small bit of wisdom in your lack of motivationperhaps people in your life are pressuring you to do things you don't want to do  Sometimes we rebel by becoming apathetic  because deep down we know we are meant to do what pleases us  and not just what impresses others 
Do you vomit with it too  I hate feeling like this  It comes and goes  It's not one of my standard anxiety symptoms  so when it does peak  it makes me more anxious  
Much use those are  Look through the posts  There are many poets per day with people calling and the person on the other side either hangs up  tells you to such it up and that it's not that bad  or even to go do something crazy   Hotlines exist  But they're not filled with trained psychologists who give a damn or at least try to 
Hyper ventilation can actually cause this  Especially if you're worried about your breathing you tend to breathe more than you need to  reducing the C02 content in your blood a lot and making your breathing rhythm weird  might feel like you can't take a breath  elevated heart rate etc    It's not harmful at all and is normally regulated by the body but with anxiety you can focus on it too much and prevent your body from getting back into its rhythm   Try taking deep breaths through your nose  holding for 4 6 seconds and breathing out slowly through your mouth  Having a conversation with someone also helps as when youre concentrating on that your body takes over your breathing 
It took me a few tries but I have a good team of doctors   The lab work found mine and with the supplements she recommended I m feeling so much better   But please dont start taking any until you get the workup done  vitamin poisoning is a very real thing   Be smart  good doctors that don't want to force you into a starvation diet or invasive surgery do exist 
I am worried because she mentioned not having gear or money to buy gear   
How have you been coping 
Heya   how are things going on yo end kiddo  I checked myself into a psych ward and may get zoloft tomorrow   do you know anything about that  Feel better too homie   I pray for us all 
Like most things  which is horrible for us    
I'd love to  but even on the chats here do I say uninterested shit people will just leave me and that's the story of my social life 
Therapy doesn't produce instant results  Give it time  listen and try your best  All will be well  There will be ups and plenty of downs in recovery 
Yes to glasses  I'm always feeling the area around we're the ends are on my head above my ears  Thoroughly convinced there is going to be a permanent imprint 
I definitely relate with you here  "Recovery " whatever it means or entails  would be hard  terrifying  unfamiliar  and who knows if it'll be worth it in the end or if it'll even work  It's hard to remember who you were before this  That's something that depression does to you that keeps you from improving   At this point  I've only taken steps forward because I trust my friends that it's going to be worth it  and it'll be better for them  We'll see how long that lasts  though 
I have always done to help  Anxiety comes from within  so a distraction helps keep calm so you can address yourself later 
High School fucking sucks  hard  From what I here it sounds like your talents are wasted there and you are not understood  Get out or start making a plan  I quit high school a year early  against my parents will  and it was the best thing I ever did  Seriously in long the long it makes no difference   there's so many other options to get a uni  placement if that's what you desire  Do you have any relatives who live near civilization and would let you sleep on their floor  Even just for a week  so you can have a break   I only know what I have read here   but seems like your parents don't know what's best for you   even if they think they do  be strong willed and politely stand your ground against them  Take a mental health day off school and drain the fuck out of that data plan  if your parents complain explain that country internet is shit and you need to be in a place where unlimited fiber optic plans are available 
I've found proper 'sleep hygiene' to be the most helpful  though not perfect  Then the meds on top of that ensure that the majority of my nights I have good sleep  I hear how others handle their sleep and cringe to be honest  both bp and healthy  Most things are small and simple but they add up and do help of you stick to them
Dang that's really good   It seems whenever people ask me either "how are you doing" or "is everything ok" I always and up saying "I'm good" or the standard "I'm just tired"  anyways I really like your drawing
sometimes i get mine in my sleep  ill wake up with a fast heartbeat and its thumping against my throat    eyes are bloodshot     and then i cant sleep for the rest of the night
It took months of  trial and error to find this guy  he definitely wasn't my first choice  but there are some out there   
As long as you aren't going for something pointless like music  college is definitely worth it  
It's so much easier to just say that than try and be vulnerable   Thanks so much 
Unfortunately psychiatric pills have terrible side effects 
oh  That's not so good   Decent winter gear isn't cheap  unless she's car camping and can just retreat to the vehicle when it doesn't go right  that might still be ok 
Yes  caffeine makes me more anxious  If I drink a lot of tea in a short amount of time  I will also become very anxious   The cure  besides cutting down on caffeine  I find that taking salty food or isotonic drinks help to mitigate the anxiety  You can try adding some salt into your water to drink 
You've been given a golden opportunity for sweet revenge  Don't squander it and fall prey to this game of hers  Best revenge is no response  This is perfect  don't ruin it by validating her and definitely do not give her satisfaction that you still care by telling her how she hurt you  That'll feed right into her ego  Pop her ego with the pin of silence  Good luck and I hope to god you didn't cave and reply  
You don't have to go to university right away  And once you're not going straight from high school to uni  a lot of schools have mature student status which can override any missing credits  or offer ways to make up for them  I felt so similar at your age  I felt so pressured to take the right classes and pick the right college program  and I ended up hating the program and dropping out because my anxiety and ADD were getting so bad from all the pressure  I started working full time at a coffee shop and worked up to a retail job that was a lot less stressful  and now I'm back to the same coffee shop franchise because that retail job ended up being a lot of unsafe work environments and abusive managers  I'm in a dump and feel trapped in the fast food industry  but if there's anything good it's that I don't have a degree being unused weighing down my shoulders and I have all the time in the world to pick what I want to do  Seriously  college is a giant ball of stress and there's no shame in taking time to think about it when you don't have the pressure of graduation on your shoulders  
Thanks man 
I'm sorry for both of you  Is she going with a group or alone  It can be scary when you feel like you can't help
